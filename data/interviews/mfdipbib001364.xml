                <p>Copyright 2006 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Harold Davey. I am interviewing Gerald Holmes and
                        today is February 8, 1996. Gerry, first of all, you might tell us about your
                        involvement in international labor. When did it start and in what way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: It started in January 1956 when I started to work in the international
                    branch of the then Bureau of Employment Security. I was there for 18 months
                    during which time I developed programs for foreign visitors mostly under the
                    Technical Assistance Program. I also served on my first Selection Board which
                    involved Wristonization, so you had a big, fat folder for the Foreign Service
                    Officers and you had a little folder with two pieces of paper or so on the
                    people who were being integrated, so this was a real challenge. (This is the
                    first of five boards I served on between 1956 and 1986.) After 18 months I went
                    to the Technical Cooperation Division of the Office of International Labor,
                    which was a predecessor of ILAB (Bureau of International Labor Affairs,
                    Department of Labor), and eventually I wound up as Deputy Director of the
                    International Trade Union Organization Division, where I concentrated primarily
                    on Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, you retired when, Gerry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I retired at the beginning of August 1991, so we are talking about 1956
                    to 1991.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would be 35 years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: That's right. Virtually all my work with the exception of maybe one year
                    in the Labor Department was in the international area.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I thought it might be useful to discuss some of the
                        veteran labor attach�s first before we turn to some of the others. Looking
                        down the list of labor attach�s who had five or more overseas labor
                        assignments including one or more in Europe, the first name on the list is
                        Herb Baker. I know he had a number of European assignments during this time.
                        In particular, I remember Italy and Germany near the tail-end of his career.
                        What recollections do you have of Herb Baker's career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: The only place I visited when Herb Baker was there was during his tenure
                    in Bonn. To be honest with you, there isn't any particular incident that comes
                    to mind. Herb, of course, was in Germany back in the 1940s in the Office of
                    Military Government, so he knew the place inside out and had an enormous number
                    of contacts. My impression is that his term in Bonn was very successful in that
                    he didn't have any internal problems in the embassy. I can't remember at this
                    point who the ambassador was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He went on to Italy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I never visited Italy while he was down there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, aside from your visiting him personally, what about
                        your role in receiving his reports and other communications?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, there was one little incident involving Herb. He sent in a cable
                    because the German Trade Union Federation, the DGB, wanted some materials. I got
                    that cable, and I wondered about it, but I went through channels, and the reply
                    from the AFL-CIO came back and said, “We would be delighted to furnish the
                    German Trade Union Federation with all these materials, but why on earth are
                    they going through the labor attach�? Why don't they just write to us?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, that was a standard AFL-CIO answer to the labor
                        attach�s. I had that in the Near East and South Asia too. They would always
                        say, “Why go through the labor attach�? Why don't they write directly to
                        us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: At this point at least, they were trying to stay clear of government
                    involvement to the extent that they could. This was before the days of the
                    [AFL-CIO] institutes and taking ICA money and all that stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, Italy was a little trickier question with the
                        various factions and federations.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Italy was clear cut in the sense that at that time you certainly stayed
                    away from the Communist CGIL and unlike some other labor counselors, Herb never
                    had any temptation to flirt with them, so he didn't get into any trouble.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But wasn't there a period when the ambassador under Carter
                        might have wanted to have more of an opening to the left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, there was a problem, and this was when Howard Samuel was here [in
                    ILAB]. The new ambassador, Gardner, couldn't understand and wanted the labor
                    attach�—I guess it was Herb Baker—to have a contact with the CGIL. I somehow got
                    wind of the fact that Howard was going to weigh in with the AFL-CIO on this. So
                    I marched myself into Howard's office, and I said, “It's kind of presumptuous of
                    me to tell you about trade union matters, Howard, but I think you ought to
                    know,” and then I gave him the history of why we were in trouble. And I said,
                    “Among the staunchest defenders of that history is the International Affairs
                    Department of the AFL-CIO,” and as far as I know, nothing more happened on this
                    particular issue. I don't think Howard ever attempted to push it further.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we'll discuss this issue again with some of the
                        other labor attach�s as we go down the list. Any more comments about Herbert
                        Baker in addition to these incidents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, I think he was one of the more important labor attach�s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would, of course, say he had the full confidence of
                        AFL-CIO plus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Absolutely. He was one of the people that they intrinsically trusted in
                    part because of some incidents in Pakistan where he stood up to the ambassador
                    in refusing to have contacts with trade unions that were beyond the pale.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, as I recall that incident second hand, there was a
                        Communist Chinese trade union group, which came to a Pakistan trade union
                        meeting, and Herb and the other labor attach�s were invited to be on the
                        rostrum, but Herb didn't want to be on the rostrum with this group. This was
                        1960. So he walked out, and then the ambassador told him afterwards—I guess
                        it got some bad publicity in the Pakistan press—”Next time you should stay
                        there,” and Herb said, “Would you put that in writing?” The ambassador was
                        incensed that somebody would question that his oral word was good. But Herb,
                        knowing the history of what had gone on in the Cold War and so on, wanted it
                        in writing. Instead the ambassador sent a cable to Washington that said, “I
                        want Herb out immediately.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Herb was transferred on something like 24-hour notice
                        and left. Well now, moving on to the next person on the list, it's Paul
                        Bergman. Now Paul Bergman had some European assignments. He was in France, I
                        guess, as assistant labor attach�, and then he came to Austria in 1970 and
                        Canada in 1974.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I really don't have too much of a recollection, because primarily I know
                    Paul Bergman from the days when he used to work in ILAB and used to program
                    foreign visitors. I really can't shed much light on his Foreign Service career,
                    to be honest with you.</p>
                <p>Q: He was also in the occupation of Germany, I believe, with a group that later
                    came to ILAB and somebody like Herb Baker.</p>
                <p>HOLMES: Like Zempel and Wertz.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, Arnold Zempel and Wertz.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I'm not aware of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He did work there early on, so that would be before you
                        saw him in ILAB. All right, the next one would be Richard Booth. Now Booth
                        was in Europe in Norway in 1973 as labor attach�. He went to Italy as
                        assistant labor attach�, I know, because of his wife's illness. When he came
                        back to Europe, he was in Belgium in 1983 as labor attach� and Switzerland
                        and Geneva, which is, of course, technically not in EUR but in a way it is.
                        And he had other assignments. What do you recall? In fact, Dick right now is
                        in Mexico as labor attach�.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, I don't know to what extent we're telling tales out of school here,
                    but I distinctly had the impression when I was in Norway in 1974 that the local
                    was really kind of domineering and running the office, which I thought was a
                    somewhat unfortunate situation. Dick never struck me as terribly forceful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have an opportunity to see him in Italy or
                        Belgium, or his work in Belgium when he was the labor attach� in Belgium at
                        the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, not particularly.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, in Geneva you would see him peripherally, not
                        directly. All right, let's go on to Sy Chalfin. Now Sy had a number of
                        European assignments. I see he was in France at the OECD in 1968 and he was
                        in Canada in 1971 and Sweden in 1974.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I remember Sy, of course, from when we both used to work together in the
                    same office here. The first thing I remember about Sy and the Labor Attach�
                    Corps was when he was here waiting for an assignment in Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He went to Ghana.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: That's right, and George L. P. Weaver, for whatever personal reasons,
                    wouldn't let him go, wouldn't clear him. Then one day just before Christmas,
                    George L. P. Weaver walked through the office, and lo and behold, virtually
                    nobody was working except Sy Chalfin, who promptly thereafter went to
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it may not be fair to charge, but I can only
                        hypothesize that Weaver may have been looking for an African-American
                        candidate to go to Ghana, and he was holding this open hoping to find one.
                        Then maybe somebody else didn't qualify.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I suspect that's the case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In France he was at the USOECD.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I remember one thing. Sy was considered for the embassy job, and Sargent
                    Shriver was the ambassador. It impressed me that Sargent Shriver wanted a
                    21-year-old with 40 years of experience. For some reason he rejected Sy, and Sy
                    wound up in the OECD job.</p>
                <p>Q: I recall part of that incident. Sy may have already been in the OECD job and
                    was rejected for the embassy job while he was there, because they brought him
                    over for an interview. But in any event, as I recall, the ambassador wanted an
                    opening to the left like we were talking about in Italy, and he decided that any
                    career labor attach� wouldn't be able to do that because he would be too
                    concerned about AFL-CIO attitudes, so he wanted to get a non-career labor
                    attach� or somebody who was not tied to the AFL-CIO. I thought maybe he wanted
                    to get an academic from outside who would come in on a one-time basis, but when
                    Sy had his interview, as I understand it, Sy had a pipe and looked very
                    reflective.</p>
                <p>HOLMES: That's Sy, all right.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the ambassador came out saying he's too much like an
                        academic. In any event, he rejected him for the job, and that will lead us
                        to another person actually. Any more about Sy? He went to Canada and Sweden.
                        Have you anything memorable on his assignments in those two jobs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: My impression was that he was particularly successful in Sweden. I always
                    thought Sy's reporting was very thoughtful. Incidentally, Sy didn't come out of
                    the trade union movement, so he didn't have that [background].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But he was a kind of a career labor person.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, yes, no question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I think that, therefore, would have been a problem. Of
                        course, the ambassador didn't know what he wanted anyway. Well, I think that
                        brings us to the next person, John Condon, because part of John's career was
                        in France under Sargent Shriver.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: He seems to have been in France forever. As a matter of fact, he was
                    there for seven years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was assigned there in 1970, and I guess Shriver came
                        in. Shriver was appointed by Nixon, as I recall. He was appointed by a
                        Republican President.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: One of the incidents I remember about John Condon was when he got invited
                    to the—I guess it was 1973—Congress of the Communist CGT in France, and the
                    embassy dutifully sent a cable to State to clear it. Dan Goott, of course, was
                    fit to be tied.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dan Goott was the European area advisor at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: And Dan was exceedingly close to the AFL-CIO. Anyhow, it hit the fan and
                    the answer was no. Several years later I discussed this with the then political
                    counselor in the embassy, Hank Cohen, and he just smiled and said, “Well, I
                    don't know whether you noticed it, Gerry, but the next time the CGT had a
                    congress, we didn't query Washington.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the result in the first instance was that the
                        embassy was represented by a political officer who worked for another
                        agency.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But from the AFL-CIO's perspective, it wasn't a labor
                        attach� who did the coverage. Therefore, it was more acceptable, although I
                        imagine they would have preferred that nobody from the embassy cover it. But
                        the embassy did that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about John Condon's relations with the ambassador? We
                        talked about an initiative to the left which Sargent Shriver was trying at
                        that time because he felt that the French government was not reaching all
                        elements of the French society.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, I don't have the feeling that John ever had any trouble within the
                    embassy. John did a lot of good for the embassy because he was a very
                    broad-gauged officer and he had contact with a wide spectrum. I remember going
                    to the theater one evening with him and Nancy. He had a Gaullist deputy with
                    him. One evening they had a dinner at his house, where I met Jacques Delors,
                    who, of course, in the meantime has gone on to fame. Jacques came out of the
                    Catholic trade union movement. I was just very impressed that whatever John was
                    doing, he had a very, very wide range of contacts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had a lot of journalists and academicians come to those
                        parties that you and others have told me about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: It was very impressive. It was also a family effort, because his then
                    much younger children would serve and Nancy would cook, and they did a great
                    deal of entertaining.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As for Ambassador Shriver's opening to the left, London
                        was fortunate in a sense that Shriver left before London was forced to do
                        things that would have hurt John's career, particularly in his relations
                        with the AFL-CIO.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, he did pay. He was never persona grata with the AFL-CIO, and he did
                    pay a price for it, because the only ambassadorship he got was to Fiji. Somehow
                    it was my impression that the fellow who helped him is the fellow who is now
                    very much in the news, Mr. Holbrook, who was then Assistant Secretary for the
                    Far East. I think John would have dearly liked an ambassadorship in North
                    Africa, but I think the AFL-CIO nixed that one.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We should say that John's background was with the armed
                        services as a labor relations man in Morocco and North Africa, in and out of
                        France and North Africa but responsible for those bases, one of several
                        successful labor attach�s, by the way, who came out of the military. Herb
                        Ihrig is another one who quickly comes to mind. I think there might have
                        been another one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: He was a very good labor attach� in Sweden.</p>
                <p>Q: So some of these labor attach�s had that background. But then when I went out
                    to Tunisia as a labor officer in 1959, John was working here in Washington as. .
                    . Was he an area advisor perhaps? At least he was waiting to go out to be a
                    labor attach�. He was being groomed to go to Algeria, but Algerian peace talks
                    or independence delayed his assignment for several years. Eventually I left
                    Tunis and was replaced by Terry Todman as labor officer, but a couple months
                    later John came out as labor attach� shortly after I left in 1961. Then in 1963
                    he went on to Algeria when that post opened up. So he was in grooming a long
                    time for that job.</p>
                <p>HOLMES: He also grew up in the Mediterranean, so that kind of helped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's true. Now let's see. Going on to Peter Dodd, he was
                        in Norway in 1976, which was his only European experience. Of course, you've
                        seen him in other places.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I saw Peter in Norway. If I remember correctly, I arrived, and one of the
                    things I asked him about was why there was no report on the last trade union
                    congress. He allowed as how the DCM, Mr. Bremer, I guess one of Kissinger's
                    boys, said it wasn't important enough to report on. So I don't think Peter had
                    too happy a time at that embassy. They still had the same local, incidentally,
                    in the labor attach� office, but there was no doubt in my mind that Dodd was
                    running the office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know if I mentioned this in my interview with
                        Howard Samuel, but when Howard and I visited Oslo, we were taken on some
                        visits and we were very much impressed by Dodd's forceful attitude, because
                        in his personal discussions Peter is very quiet and reserved, but [in more
                        formal group meetings], he was very much leading the discussion, had some
                        points he wanted to make, and made them very effectively and firmly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I would second that. I had the same impression that, although he's quiet,
                    he's forceful.</p>
                <p>Q: He had, I know, some illness after that and had to leave Norway, and then
                    later on he served in Washington and went out to Indonesia, the Philippines and
                    Japan. I think he's just retiring from Japan right about now, so he's had an
                    illustrious career.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, he has.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, going on to John Doherty, he had two European
                        assignments. Of course, you served with John for a long time in ILAB before
                        he joined the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you know John from Washington as well as the
                        field.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Right. He was at USEC, and what was his other European assignment?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Portugal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Portugal. I never visited him in Portugal, but I certainly remember
                    visiting him in USEC. He, of course, had a great trade union background, so he
                    was really wired in with all the international organizations. Although John was
                    a supporter of trade unions, he never was uncritical. He used his own judgment,
                    and I think he was a more effective officer for it. He did not necessarily
                    always agree with the AFL-CIO version of the international trade union
                    movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see Jim Shea has done an interview with John Doherty
                        [for the Labor Diplomacy Oral History Project], so I trust they covered many
                        of the other incidents that we're familiar with about Mexico, for example,
                        and Argentina and the more colorful dealings.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: All I have on that is secondhand.</p>
                <p>Q: Now in Lisbon, as I recall, he took an assignment which was somewhat under his
                    grade, although later events boosted the importance of Portugal when the
                    long-time, military government of Salazar was overthrown, but as I recall, the
                    reason he went to Portugal and some of these other places was due to the size of
                    his family. There was a problem at one point housing John with his ten dependent
                    children.</p>
                <p>HOLMES: That's right. You're correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So partly he went to Portugal for that reason, I believe.
                        Anyway, I would say, from my observation of John, not directly as the area
                        advisor in the area he served but as Foreign Service [Coordinator], he was a
                        very effective labor attach� and had good contacts. I don't know on the
                        reporting side how much reporting he did, but the personal contact, I'm
                        sure, was good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, his reporting was more than adequate. It wasn't just reporting. It
                    also was good analysis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, Cliff Finch.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I really have nothing to say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Finch was in Spain in 1962 in your area, but you didn't
                        see much from Finch?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Very little.</p>
                <p>Q: I don't know if he's doing an interview here or not, but there was a big
                    incident when Cliff was labor attach� in Egypt, which we ought to mention here
                    if it hasn't been discussed elsewhere. This was during the days when Abdul
                    Nasser was just taking over. Cliff went to a meeting of Egyptian trade union
                    leaders, and afterwards he was assaulted and roughed up and robbed, and he went
                    to the police chief to report this incident. They were taking notes and so on,
                    and he said, “They stole my watch,” and the police chief said, “What, they stole
                    your watch!” He seemed to be surprised at this. So the idea was that Nasser was
                    trying to cut off all ties of labor with any outside people like the U.S.
                    Government and other people. Well, we're going to stop now, and we'll resume
                    later.</p>
                <p>Now, we're back on line with Gerry Holmes, and I'm Harold Davey. We have finished
                    discussing Cliff Finch, and the next person on the list is John Grimes. Now
                    let's see.</p>
                <p>HOLMES: He was assistant in France and then labor attach� in Belgium.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, what do you recall about John?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Mostly his piano-playing wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, anything else?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Not particularly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't John in Tunis at one point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: John was in Trinidad and Tobago, France, Zaire, Belgium, Tunisia, and
                    France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, well, we'll go on from John Grimes to Bob Hare,
                        Charles Robert Hare. Gerry, I know he used to work with you here in
                        ILAB.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: We used to work together in the same office. He had problems in Belgium,
                    I gather. I don't know what the problems were exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Belgium, I see, was his fourth labor attach� assignment
                        starting in 1974.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Right, and he had some problems within the embassy which I don't really
                    know of. He also had some personal problems. I think this is one episode why his
                    promotion was kind of delayed by several years, because the Foreign Service
                    unfortunately writes these things in indelible ink and people have terribly long
                    memories. Then, of course, he went on to the Barbados, which was somewhat below
                    his then grade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now before Barbados I notice he went to Geneva. Did you
                        have any contact with him there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, not really.</p>

                        bit below his rank. Then he went to Spain, which was also somewhat below his
                        rank probably. Did you have any contact with him in Spain?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I read his reporting, and I occasionally talked to him, but I didn't
                    visit him while he was in Spain.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I was gone.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's go on to John LaMazza, who served in Europe, I
                        believe, while you were working on Europe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: John was in Spain, I remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Spain in 1980, and then Canada in 1992, but you were gone
                        by the time he got to Canada. So the only European assignment he had while
                        you were here was Spain in 1980 to 1984. Were there any issues that came
                        up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I was in Spain a couple times. I thought he was very well wired in and he
                    wasn't having any problems. I don't remember any particular crises in Spain at
                    that time. The one thing I remember was that his wife very much wanted to come
                    home, and then the next thing I knew his next assignment was in Argentina and
                    his wife was in Fairfax County. I don't know where that went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John was quiet at a number of labor attach� conferences I
                        went to. He was so quiet at one of them Jim Taylor thought he should have
                        made more of a contribution, but I understand reading some of his reports
                        that he was an excellent writer, that LaMazza's prose and analysis were very
                        good. Do you recall that in his reporting from Spain?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, it was good, but I think by and large most Foreign Service officers
                    write very well, and I don't think that his writing stands out in my mind
                    particularly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, let's talk about John Gwynn. He only had four labor
                        attach� assignments overseas, but he had many labor jobs here in
                        Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I saw him in Spain.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, Spain.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: The first time I saw him, I guess Franco was still in power, and he
                    seemed extremely well wired in. I remember we had lunch with someone from the
                    opposition who had just gotten out of jail, and I also remember that some people
                    who would not visit John in the embassy would come to his house in the evening.
                    For instance, I remember a meeting we had with one of the metal workers. John
                    also seemed to be on good terms with everyone in the embassy, at a time when
                    dealing with the opposition was a somewhat sensitive task.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, because Franco was still in power.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Correct, John really knew Spain well. I guess he was born in Barcelona.
                    John was somewhat deceptive. He tended to be somewhat quiet, but I think he was
                    a very effective officer. I'm also somewhat familiar with the work he did when
                    he was assigned to USIA here in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: He really set up what was the first go-round on [the AFL-CIO] Free Trade
                    Union Institute, and he got some money for the Iberian Peninsula when that was
                    opening up. So I think he was a very effective officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see he went to Portugal in 1979 as labor attach�. Do you
                        recall anything during that period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, not particularly. I don't remember visiting him ever, and I don't
                    remember anything in particular about his assignment there, to be honest with
                    you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have another one on your list that you want to
                        comment on before we get down to Irwin Lippe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, I just thought that Bill Harbin did a very creditable job in Italy.
                    I also think that he did a very good job when he was regional officer in Central
                    America, and I think he got penalized there because he was working for an
                    ambassador who resented his regional responsibilities, and this accounts for the
                    fact that he was somewhat held back career-wise. He then got two rapid
                    promotions which kind of repaired part of the damage. I think this was an
                    instance of an officer being penalized for his regional responsibility by an
                    ambassador who wanted to hog his time. That's all I have to say about that.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's an interesting comment on the problems of a
                        regional officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, fortunately I was able to explain this to the selection board.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With regard to Canada in 1981, Italy in 1989?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I think it's difficult to make something out of the job in Canada,
                    because the trade unions are so close. But I thought he did a great job, and the
                    embassy obviously thought so too, because I'm sure in part the recommendations
                    he got from his immediate superior and the ambassador accounted for his getting
                    promoted after he got out of Canada.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, he was assigned to Italy in 1989. Do you recall
                        anything about that assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I thought his reporting was excellent. He seemed to have no problems
                    within the embassy that I was aware of. I thought everything was very
                    timely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think in Italy he had one of the assignments a labor
                        attach� gets in a large country with a lot of high-level travel, the care
                        and feeding of Secretaries of Labor. As I recall, he was particularly well
                        appreciated by the entourage of a couple of Secretaries for his helpfulness
                        in arranging programs. Of course, this is a no-win situation. If you foul up
                        with the Secretary of Labor, then you're hurt; and if you do well, you're
                        expected to do well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, except that I would just say that he found himself having to service
                    some very demanding Secretaries of Labor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Not to say irrationally demanding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To escape unscathed from that was an accomplishment. So
                        who next on your list do you want to comment on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Hilburn went to USEC just about the time I was leaving, but I have always
                    been very impressed by him. I thought his assignment to the embassy in Belgium
                    was clearly well below his capacity.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that was sort of a grooming to be the Brussels USEC
                        labor attach� later on, about the time you left.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I know that his assignment in Geneva was exceedingly successful, because
                    I remember talking to our various colleagues who dealt with the International
                    Labor Organization, and they couldn't have been more enthusiastic about his
                    abilities. They were very upset that he did not get promoted. All the people who
                    dealt with him in Geneva were very complimentary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, who is next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, there's just one funny thing I'll say about Immerman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bob Immerman.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I arrived in Tokyo—and, as you know, that's a long, long flight—and I had
                    a cold and I was thoroughly exhausted. Bob Immerman, who, of course, is an old
                    Japanese hand, insisted on taking me out for supper and spending something like
                    four hours briefing me, and I was ready to drop.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After a time change and everything else plus a cold.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: He, however, did arrange for us—Ed McHale was in Japan at the same
                    time-to stay in a Japanese inn in Kyoto since he had rat lines all over. I guess
                    he even had hopes of coming back to Tokyo as a DCM, which never panned out. But
                    he was very much identified with Japan. He was one of those one-country
                    officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, of course, he was extremely fluent in Japanese.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, who next do you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, I visited Alden Irons in Finland. This was way back in the early
                    1970s. I can't remember anything worthwhile about that frankly.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Emil Lindahl was in Canada in 1979, I see, although
                        most of his career was in Asia. Do you have anything to say about Emil?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, I think Canada frankly was often used as a parking site for people
                    about to retire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think maybe we should mention here, because it reflects
                        on the role of labor attach�, that when the Prime Minister of Australia came
                        to the United States some years later and Emil was very sick and had retired
                        down in Florida . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: It was Bob Hawke, correct?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bob Hawke, and there was a phone call to Emil in Florida,
                        his wife picked up and the voice on the other side said, “This is Bob
                        Hawke,” and she said, “Yes, and this is Maggie Thatcher.” But it turned out
                        that it really was Bob Hawke, so he had a long chat with Emil. In fact, Emil
                        sent me a letter about this. Hawke took time out, and Emil said, “Well,
                        aren't you very busy?” “Well, yes, but it's just the head of the Federal
                        Reserve Bank, and he can wait. This is more important.” So here was a case
                        of a labor attach� in Australia who made such an impression on a trade union
                        leader who later became prime minister, that he took time out of his very
                        busy schedule in Washington to call. So I think that's an indication of the
                        effectiveness of labor attach�s at their best.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Now, Irvin Lippe had assignments in Belgium in 1958, Geneva in 1962, France in
                    1966, and the U.K. in 1969. You were working on Europe most of those years.</p>
                <p>HOLMES: And to be honest with you, I don't remember anything very striking about
                    Irvin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No big issues at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I suppose one shouldn't say anything if one can't say anything nice, so I
                    shouldn't say anything about Mr. Longmyer's assignment in Sweden.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, there's Jim Mattson, of course.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, Jim Mattson.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Who for a while worked here in the Labor Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he was the area advisor for NEA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I visited him both in Germany and in Belgium. I had the impression he
                    really had the ambassador's ear at USEC. He certainly knew his way around the
                    international trade union organizations. I think his reporting was superior. I
                    think the same thing was basically true in Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it should be noted when Gerry says that Mattson's
                        reporting on the international trade union affairs was superior, it's no
                        small praise, since Gerry has worked in that area for about three decades
                        and knows everybody there, so that's a strong accolade for Jim Mattson, who
                        in my own opinion is one of the most effective labor attach�s we've ever had
                        in the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Jim is another one of these fellows who is somewhat deceptively quiet but
                    who has a great deal to offer.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Right. I have one interesting story about Graham McKelvey. I knew him, of
                    course, when he was working here in the State Department, and he was a buddy of
                    Phil Delaney's, and I often felt that, well, the reason he was over there was
                    because he was a buddy of Phil Delaney's, because I felt that he really didn't
                    have much to offer. But I came after he had been transferred to Brussels. I
                    visited him in the embassy the first day I was in town, and Graham McKelvey sat
                    back in his chair, put his feet on his desk, and gave me one of the best
                    rundowns on the then state of the international trade union movement that anyone
                    has ever given me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, again, as I said about Mattson, praise by Gerry
                        Holmes on international trade union reporting is no small accolade. Anything
                        else on Graham McKelvey? He was in Germany, I guess, when you first came
                        into ILAB perhaps.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, yes, I don't remember that at all. I visited Bill Meagher in
                    Germany, but at that point, he already knew that his assignment was aborted for
                    family reasons. My impression is that he knew everybody who was to be known. He
                    was obviously well wired in with the trade union movement and Labor Ministry,
                    and I think if he would have stayed, he would have made a very successful labor
                    counselor in Bonn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about his assignment in Turkey? Do you have any
                        comments on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, the trouble with him in Turkey was that very often he was more of a
                    political officer than a labor officer, and of course, he eventually went on to
                    become a political officer. He obviously knew the language, and I'm not saying
                    he didn't know the labor scene inside out. The problem was he didn't always
                    report on it. So I think he knew a great deal more than he reported.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I visited Turkey on a trade fair one time shortly after he
                        had arrived, and he had only been in Turkey a few months but he was already
                        fluent enough in terms of his language facility. I recall when he was
                        recruited from the Federal Mediation Service. . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: He had been in Turkey on ICA assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had been assigned to Turkey. Before he went to Turkey
                        on the ICA assignment, he had gone out for Jim Taylor on a DOLITAC
                        assignment there, but when he was recruited for that one, he learned his
                        Turkish in Detroit before he even left. It was that time, I guess, I saw
                        him, and he could speak Turkish only a couple months after arriving.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: One problem I've never quite forgiven Bill for, although I like him, was
                    that when he returned to the embassy as political officer, I don't know what
                    happened, but the embassy reporting on labor for a couple of years just went to
                    pot. I would have liked to think that as a former labor attach� he would have
                    done more to insure labor reporting, but I guess the ambassador, who was
                    Strausz-Hup�. . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Strausz-Hup�.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Strausz-Hup� had his own priorities and Bill worked for the
                    ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, during the time...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>HOLMES: I don't understand, because Strausz-Hup� was basically supportive of
                    labor. He had a good relationship with the AFL-CIO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time Bill Meagher was doing labor work the
                        first time, before the period you talked about when he was political
                        officer, I recall Ambassador Strausz-Hup� really appreciated [Bill's work],
                        because Turkey's trade union federation was having trouble with the ICFTU
                        and was being suspended. The Ambassador was trying his best through the
                        ICFTU and cables to our USEC Embassy in Brussels to put the best case
                        forward for Turkey and for the Turkish Confederation of Labor. That was a
                        time when they were very close together. Since Bill was a lateral-entry
                        labor attach�, the fact that he was able to do well as a labor officer and
                        then as a political officer showed the broadness of some of our labor
                        officers. As I recall Ambassador Strausz-Hup� nominated Bill for the Murphy
                        Award, a reporting award, over the political and economic officers at the
                        post. So here was a lateral-entry labor attach� who got nominated by the
                        ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: The fellow is obviously a linguist. When he came here, he got the ARA
                    slot, and I met him at FMCS something like six weeks after he started on the
                    job, and he was rattling off Spanish.</p>
                <p>Q: Bill had taken a reduction in grade. He had first been promised a senior
                    Foreign Service position in Ankara, Turkey, by a senior personnel official in
                    the State Department but then along the way State Department personnel
                    discovered that the job he was going to in Turkey was not a senior job but
                    something like the equivalent of a GS15, and that's all they could give him
                    then. Although he had permission from the head of FMCS for re-employment rights
                    when he applied for this job and got a letter of acceptance from State
                    Department, along the way there was a change in the director of FMCS and the new
                    director sent him a letter that said, “I do not honor that agreement.” Now Bill
                    still went ahead, both with a job below his grade and bareback in effect, that
                    is with no re-employment rights, although he might have been able to contest it
                    since he had an earlier letter. Fortunately for Bill and for labor attach�s in
                    the Foreign Service, he did get promoted based on this other record we've been
                    talking about—this is great labor political work—and got his status then when he
                    was promoted into the senior Foreign Service. So it worked out well for Bill
                    Meagher. All right, now, Gerry, who?</p>
                <p>HOLMES: Art Meyerson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Only a couple of things: First of all, I knew him from college. We went
                    to George Washington University graduate school together. Secondly, he was very
                    bright. I think he was primarily an economist. He did all right in USEC, and I'm
                    sure he went on to great things.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the assistant labor attach� in USEC.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes. I don't really remember anything in particular about Bruce Millen
                    except his reporting from Turkey was nothing spectacular. I remember Joe Mintzes
                    when he was area advisor in State. He was both in State and in France and an
                    exceedingly thoughtful and very good analyst. That's about all I can say. A very
                    considerate man.</p>
                <p>Q: Back to Millen, I'm sure he's covered this in his own oral history, but in his
                    assignment as assistant labor attach� in Italy in 1951, he had a big dispute
                    with the labor counselor over contacts with the Italian trade union movement. He
                    was serving under Colonel Thomas Lane. Bruce was on the losing edge of that,
                    because he was the more junior officer, and it may have affected his career for
                    a while, his advocacy of broader contacts on the part of the embassy, but he
                    went on to have an excellent career in the Foreign Service despite some problems
                    along the way career-wise.</p>
                <p>HOLMES: Colonel Lane, of course, was a pretty imposing figure, physically and
                    just generally speaking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Colonel Lane had been there in the early occupation days
                        and was well known. Jim Taylor used to tell the story about how all of the
                        Italian trade unionists were beholden to him to get a pass to get out of
                        town. After the war, they remembered him, and he had great contacts. All
                        right, who's next on your list?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, there's Jack Muth, whom I remember both from France and from USEC.
                    Jack, of course, is just about the only one who's left in the Labor Attach�
                    Corps who was recruited from the trade unions. So he was always very closely
                    wired in, I think, with George Meany and the boys. But aside from that, both in
                    France and in USEC, he was very well wired in. I can't think of any specific
                    incident that would shed any particular light on anything here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Jack had the unfortunate situation of following
                        Jim Mattson in Brussels USEC, and Jim Mattson was a rather prolific
                        reporter. So it made it a little difficult, although Muth obviously had the
                        knowledge and the contacts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, and Muth did not neglect reporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, but just by comparison.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, I think in general Mattson is a more active person than Muth, and
                    maybe that was reflected in the reporting. I'm sure there was as much going on
                    when Jack was in town as when Jim was in town, but Jim just was more involved in
                    things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I see Ernie Nagy on the list. He had several
                        European assignments. In fact, all of his labor assignments were in
                        Europe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I remember Ernie. I can't remember much about him in Germany. I'm not
                    sure he wasn't an assistant there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I think he was. I think he was in Berlin as assistant
                        labor attach�.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: That's right. He was in Berlin when Kennedy went there. I remember when
                    he first went out to Denmark in 1966 and I briefed him, and I was somewhat
                    unfavorably impressed by his constant references to Jay Lovestone and all the
                    great things that Jay Lovestone was going to do for him including, when he got
                    through in Copenhagen, Lovestone was going to make sure that he got to Bonn. In
                    any event, Ernie Nagy never did get to Bonn. I was with Secretary Usery when he
                    called on Rome, and Ernie Nagy obviously was well prepared for this whole visit
                    and very well organized and even had his neighbors in to meet the Secretary in
                    his lovely rooftop apartment. He had a rooftop apartment overlooking the whole
                    city that was pretty impressive. I also met Ernie in the United Kingdom at a
                    stage when he was pretty much disenchanted and the handwriting was on the wall
                    that he wasn't going to be putting up with this treatment any longer. He
                    obviously had difficulties within the embassy in getting proper recognition. I
                    have no sense as to what the cause of this was or who, if anybody, was
                    responsible for it, but, of course, he's one of the few people who went to
                    London and then quit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One comment on Ernie Nagy: He was one of the labor
                        officers who was primarily a political officer with some labor
                        qualifications, and he would come in and out of labor work when there were
                        assignments that he was qualified for, but I think he was viewed as a very
                        broad labor officer like some others we've talked about. So that was a
                        factor in his assignment to London in 1984, as I recall.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I am looking at Pfotenhauer. He was in Austria in 1984.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>HOLMES: All I will say is that I think he was assigned there because his spouse
                    was assigned to the U.S. Mission and better no labor attach� than David
                    Pfotenhauer. I think his heart was not in it. He obviously wished he had been
                    somewhere else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Then we get to Margaret Plunkett.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that's right, Margaret Plunkett.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I knew Margaret, of course, because she worked here in the Bureau of
                    Labor Statistics. But Margaret in her first assignment in the Netherlands only
                    proved how wrong I could be, because I told everybody within earshot that
                    sending a woman to the Netherlands was terrible. They had this Teutonic concept
                    that women should go to church, school, and take care of the kids. But anyhow, I
                    went to Holland, and she had everybody including the trade unionists eating out
                    of her hand. I got any number of unsolicited favorable comments from the trade
                    unionists about Margaret. It turned out Margaret's biggest problem was the fact
                    she was in an embassy in which her political superior, Dan Horowitz, was a
                    former labor attach�, something that often brings grief to labor attach�s. But
                    she was exceedingly successful, and, of course, you know more than I do about
                    her work in Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One incident about the Netherlands I recall. In her
                        debriefing here, she said that people thought it would be difficult for her
                        to take trade union leaders in the Netherlands and other contacts out to buy
                        them lunch or dinner, something like that, but she found there was no
                        problem whatsoever. They let her pick up the check. This supposed male
                        sensitivity didn't exist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, I couldn't have been more off base on this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, in Israel she did an outstanding job there. Her
                        contact in the Labor Ministry most of the time was Golda Meir. Anyway, when
                        Golda Meir went on to be Prime Minister, Margaret Plunkett was in very good
                        position as her main contact and moved up, and she utilized that very well.
                        She was very well liked in Israel and did a fantastic job while she was
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Now we've got Harry Pollak, right, in London. He comes right after Plunkett on
                    the list.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: Harry, of course, is another one of those people who was very close to
                    the trade union movement. I remember one day I was in London and he was moaning
                    and complaining about the fact that he'd lost touch with what was going on in
                    the United States and that his friends in the trade union movement weren't
                    keeping him informed. Mind you, this is London, and God knows how many visitors
                    come and go. So, as I was leaving the office, I patted a big stack of seven or
                    eight unopened [Labor Department information] packets and said, “Well, you know,
                    if you open these, you might get a better feel for what's going on at home.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good for you, Gerry.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Harry Pollak also took me to a press conference where somebody by the
                    name of Thatcher was speaking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Margaret Thatcher?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, that was the Margaret Thatcher, but at that time she was in the
                    opposition. This was when the labor government was still in power. The lady gave
                    a very interesting speech, and it was very nice of Harry to take me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it during his incumbency when Horowitz and company
                        went around to various posts to discuss possible U.S. withdrawal from the
                        ILO, or did that come later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I think that was later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, now I know you were a little disappointed with Harry
                        when he came to Washington as the Deputy S/IL and then S/IL, because when he
                        had been in Belgium and U.K., he was extremely helpful to Labor Department
                        people who had passed through. But when he got to Washington, he became very
                        bureaucratic about roles and he tried to cut the Labor Department out of the
                        voice we had before.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Maybe he was reflecting the AFL-CIO.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, but there were different personalities. Other people
                        had that job. Whatever he did, he took that position. I remember we had a
                        labor attach� conference in New Delhi when Howard Samuel and he were there
                        as co-chairmen. Harry wanted to do all the inviting including the ambassador
                        from Beijing, the former president of the UAW, and other things, so that
                        part was disappointing although he had done an outstanding job for us as
                        labor attach� in Belgium and the U.K. from all the reports I got.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>All right, Dale Povenmire?</p>
                <p>HOLMES: I visited Dale Povenmire in Portugal. I am also aware of some of his work
                    here as ARA advisor. Dale took me around parts of Portugal, and he seemed very
                    well wired in. He was, I think, a very thoughtful kind of guy. I don't recall
                    any particular incidents that could throw a light on some aspect of labor
                    issues. Of course, this was a team, because his wife was a consular officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: They had a beautiful house.</p>
                <p>Q: And went to Italy too. Did you visit him in Italy?</p>
                <p>HOLMES: I didn't visit him in Italy, but his reporting certainly was
                    superior.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I understand he did an excellent job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: He's a very thoughtful fellow. He retired actually when he was in
                    Rome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think there was a little difficulty between him and the
                        assistant labor attach� at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, there was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The assistant had a lot of personal contacts with a lot of
                        people.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, it may have been a matter of Povenmire trying to assert himself,
                    and the assistant was a fellow who had a lot of rat lines out and had been there
                    for a long time. There's always a bit of a problem when you have an assistant
                    who is, how shall we say, well entrenched because he's been there for some time,
                    and he gets a new labor counselor, labor attach�, whom from his point of view,
                    he has to break in, and he may resent it. I suspect Dale is one of those
                    fellows.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was thinking of the assistant labor attach� at the time
                        in Italy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: You mean the American assistant?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. John Fernandez.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, well, John Fernandez. Povenmire and Fernandez had very different
                    personalities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were some difficulties between the two.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I take it back now. I certainly visited Rome when John Fernandez was
                    there. John Fernandez was one of those people who was somewhat unorthodox. He
                    obviously had a great many friends. He obviously knew a lot of Italians. He had
                    a huge apartment off the Piazza Navarona, and he also had friends in other parts
                    of the embassy like administration, budget, and what have you. But Fernandez
                    liked to do his own thing. I don't think he suffered superiors gladly, never
                    mind where he was. He went on to Finland after that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I have the impression there were some problems there too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, anyway, your visit may have been when Jim Shea was
                        there. Maybe Povenmire had already gone. I see there was an overlap. Anyway,
                        who is the next person on your list? How about Hugh Reichard?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I really don't know much about Reichard, because he only had one
                    assignment [in Europe]. I knew Reichard mostly from his assignment in ILAB.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who's the next one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, I knew Irwin Rubenstein, but he never worked in Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have Bob Senser somewhere on the list and Roger
                        Schrader.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Roger Schrader reminds me of something, and Roger's as good a hook to
                    hang this on as any. I find that some labor attach�s were more successful in
                    working with USIA than others. The reason I'm saying this is that this seems to
                    be a function of the labor attach� rather than the post, because some people,
                    like Roger Schrader, wherever they went they made good use and exploited USIA in
                    terms of publications. I don't know what it was. I guess partly it's his
                    personality, and in part it's just being aware of it, but in both Bonn and
                    London and, from what I've learned from other sources, also in New Zealand, he
                    made very effective use of USIA. I first met Roger when he was working in
                    Geneva, and he had been there only six months when I arrived as U.S. delegate to
                    the ILO 9th Metal Trades Committee Meeting, but he helped steer me. In those six
                    months he had already learned a lot of the ropes, and he helped steer me through
                    the maze rather successfully. One recommendation that Roger and I both made to
                    Washington was that the U.S. delegation should always have one person who was
                    permanently going to all the industrial relations committee meetings, so that we
                    would have one guy who knew the ropes of the mechanics of administration. On my
                    delegation we had two neophytes. I guess we subsequently did that in terms of
                    picking Barbara Dunkak.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, I first met Roger when he came through
                        Southampton to a German assignment, and I used to go down and meet the ships
                        as they stopped over before they went to Germany. He and his wife were on
                        one of those ships. I had them out to our house. That goes back to 1956 or
                        1957.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I met him in 1963 in Dusseldorf when he was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was going to Dusseldorf, I think, at the time, or
                        another German post. How about Dick Searing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I think Searing was an assistant in France, but I don't remember too much
                    about him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then, Bob Senser, who was Belgium in 1962 as assistant
                        labor attach�, then Belgium USEC in 1976, and Germany.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>HOLMES: I remember him both in USEC and in Germany in 1981. Bob has the advantage
                    of being a journalist, so he writes very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: His reporting is very impressive. He certainly knows his way around the
                    trade union movement. He also has a sensitivity for those in society who are
                    less well off than others, so he was a really good match for labor a attach� who
                    sometimes has to look after the downtrodden. Yet at the same time he was
                    obviously on very good terms with the DCM and the ambassador. He was also one of
                    the first labor attach�s to live, so to speak, off base. He did not live in
                    Plittersdorf, which was the American enclave, where Herb Baker, for instance,
                    lived. Both he and Roger Schrader moved out into the economy, which I think
                    makes for a more effective labor attach�.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When he was leaving Germany, there came a point when,
                        because of age—I think he had reached the age when he was supposed to
                        retire—there was an effort [to keep him on]. I believe Lane Kirkland sent a
                        letter to the Secretary of State requesting that he be extended for a year,
                        which the Director General had the authority to do, but for some reason the
                        State Department played hardball and did not grant him the extra year. I
                        later thought this might have been a ploy to open up a spot to kick John
                        Warnock out there. They needed a place. In fact, they had tentatively
                        assigned Warnock there to get him out of the S/IL job. He couldn't take the
                        job because he had a daughter who was a senior in high school [in the
                        Washington, D.C., area] so he went to Japanese language training en route to
                        Tokyo instead. But for whatever reason, Bob Senser could have stayed one
                        more year, and I was amazed that, [given] the letter from Lane Kirkland to
                        the State Department, they didn't honor that request in the case of Bob
                        Senser.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: The problem was Bob Senser got caught in the 65 [age] ceiling before they
                    changed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but they had a grace [period of] up to a year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Now, Jim Shea. We've all had a lot of contact with Jim including several tours in
                    Europe, like Spain in 1984 and Italy in 1986.</p>
                <p>HOLMES: We all know that Jim is a great fellow who really managed to get along on
                    human terms. I think the problem with Jim was that he can find out all sorts of
                    things and learn all sorts of things, but then it comes to reporting. I think
                    his reporting at the end of his career was much better than at the beginning.
                    But reporting has just basically been Jim's Achilles heel.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that Jim was fortunate some places to have an
                        assistant or some other officer to help him on the reporting. I think in
                        Argentina in 1965 that Tony Freeman might have been there to help him do
                        some reporting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Without revealing my sources, I talked to somebody who was at the embassy
                    at that time, who said Jim was a great fellow but somebody else wrote his
                    reports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I wouldn't be surprised. Well, today we could call it
                        good delegation, but whatever...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: It was not an assistant labor attach�.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Jim's ability to make contacts, as we both know,
                        is formidable.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, yes, very impressive.</p>
                <p>Q: And through his extensive knowledge of sports, for one area, he really
                    established rapport with the local Australian soccer league or in South America
                    whatever, and he has a phenomenal memory for those sports. People in countries
                    like Brazil which Jim had left would come to Washington and be asked, “Do you
                    know any labor attach�s?” “Oh, yes, Jim Shea,” and it might have been 15 years
                    since Jim had left. I imagine in his own oral history Jim has mentioned that Bob
                    Hawke invited him to a big retirement party up in his hotel room. They invited
                    just a select few, including Jim Shea, which was quite a tribute to Jim.</p>
                <p>HOLMES: That's the sort of fellow Jim Shea is. Once you meet him, you don't
                    forget him. That's for sure. He's also out of the trade union movement.</p>
                <p>Then we come to Les Slezak, who was a saxophone player and who, you will be
                    interested to know, is now taking up the saxophone again. I first met Les in
                    Belgium. I was coming over from Poland. He certainly knew his way around
                    Belgium. He had a very difficult time in Sweden, because that was during the
                    Vietnam era and the Swedes were very unsympathetic to the Americans and his kids
                    had trouble in school. Throughout this period, though, Les's reporting from
                    Sweden was perfectly objective, and he just called it as he saw it. I don't
                    remember too much about him in the United Kingdom except that his reporting, I
                    think, was outstanding. I remember once, and this was completely unsolicited, a
                    long cable came in on the role of women in labor in the United Kingdom. It was a
                    reporting classic. It was comprehensive; it was concise; and, as far as I know,
                    it was unsolicited. But that was typical of Les.</p>

                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>HOLMES: I just think he's one of the better fellows we had in the corps, that's
                    for sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who is the next one you have on your list?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, there's this fellow Larry Specht. I did know him. He wound up in
                    Bonn because there was a slot that the State Department had allocated to the
                    AFL-CIO. I was not impressed. I went to a meeting with the then labor attach�
                    and a few people from the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, and one of the things that
                    struck me was that considering the time he had spent on it, his language
                    facility was pretty poor.</p>
                <p>Q: Is John Stephens the next person you have? He didn't have much time in
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, Stephens, I think, was an assistant. I knew Tobias, but there is not
                    much to be said about him. He was primarily political.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, he was a clear Labor Department type, but he might
                        have been political. What about anybody else on that page or the next
                        page?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, then we get to Turnquist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, let's discuss Dan Turnquist. He was in Sweden in
                        1978, France 1983, USEC 1987, and Bonn 1991.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, the thing that impresses one about Dan Turnquist is his unbounded
                    enthusiasm regardless of where he is. While Dan obviously has a low quotient for
                    language ability, he nevertheless launches in the language. The fact that,
                    however broken it may be, he uses the language of the people to whom he is
                    accredited so impresses these people usually that they are not offended by his
                    mistakes. He fortunately is not put off by the fact that he does make mistakes,
                    unlike some other labor attach�s who won't speak the language until they are
                    perfect and as the result never speak it. Dan, of course, is very well attuned
                    to the needs of the trade union movement as well State and Labor Departments.
                    His reporting, I think, is definitely superior. He leaves no stone unturned, and
                    I think he is probably, if I had to put my finger on it, the most enthusiastic,
                    ebullient character in the Labor Attach� Corps. He just is bouncy, even now, I
                    think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We should say his reporting is even more impressive
                        considering the handicap he suffers with macular degeneration, and so he has
                        a difficult time reading.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, he picks up a tremendous amount of information, and he also manages
                    to get it into print.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I would amend what you say about his knowing the
                        needs of the Labor Department. I found people coming back from a trip to
                        Europe, like a high-level Labor Department person, if they've been to five
                        countries and they had a good job done by everybody—let's say they've been
                        to Stockholm—they would sing the praises of Dan Turnquist, because he really
                        went out of his way to make their visit effective. I think he is probably
                        the most effective labor attach�, certainly one of the most effective, top
                        two or three, that I've come across overall, and his service over in State
                        Department as the deputy to John Warnock was extremely helpful to the Labor
                        Department and the labor corps. I'm just sorry that they didn't bring him
                        back to make him the head of S/IL a year or two ago. All right, do you know
                        any more about Turnquist you want to say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are the Turnquist fan club.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: That's right, definitely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Charter member.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Absolutely. I just admire the energy that this fellow brings to bear.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anybody can't be all wrong whose uncle is from Malcolm,

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: And yet, you know, in spite of this fellow always being on the run, there
                    isn't anything compulsive about him. It just comes across that he's enthusiastic
                    about what he's doing. When you go there, you know you're going to have a full
                    program.</p>
                <p>Ulriksson I just barely knew. He was there during my first visit in Germany, and
                    I guess Woltman was the assistant.</p>
                <p>Q: Was he the assistant then?</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Either Woltman or Sullivan, I can't remember. Anyhow, Ulriksson obviously
                    was one of those old trade unionists who had been in Sweden and spent a lot of
                    his time while I was visiting him in Germany talking about his lovely assignment
                    in Sweden.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Apparently it was Sullivan from the dates here.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: The interesting thing about Sullivan is that I had met him here in
                    Washington before he went over and I arrived something like less than a week
                    after he arrived in Bonn. He had just married, and he had his bride with him,
                    and they were living someplace where they had nothing but orange crates as
                    furniture, but they insisted on having me over for dinner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Ken Sullivan, who was assistant labor attach� in
                        Germany in 1963 and then labor attach� in Austria in 1967. After Ulriksson,
                        we come to John Warnock.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I don't remember too much about John in Denmark except that his reporting
                    was obviously very good. I visited him in France. John, although he was not out
                    of the trade union movement, was one of those fellows who was very much attuned
                    to the Communist menace. He sometimes saw evil where some of us found it
                    difficult to see, but anyhow he was one of these people who was exceedingly
                    thorough in what he did. His reporting certainly was very good. As far as I
                    know, he had no problems with the embassy. I had the impression he was well
                    wired in. He once sent me to an economic briefing in Paris which turned out to
                    be by an officer from the Treasury. It was one of the best economic briefings I
                    ever got. He was obviously wired in with the agency people. I think his
                    reporting was all you could have asked for. I don't remember anything
                    particularly striking about John either in Germany or the United Kingdom except
                    that he continued to do outstanding work and seemed to get along with everybody
                    up to that point. His troubles started later in Washington.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, one of the problems was that he was such a strong advocate for the labor
                    attach� program that it apparently got him kicked out of his job.</p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, we could argue about that, I think. The handwriting for John
                    Warnock was on the wall when Jesse Clear got the EUR labor advisor's slot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Against John's wishes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: At that point he knew that he and Irving Brown were not seeing eye to
                    eye.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything more on John Warnock?</hi>

                <p>HOLMES: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's see. Is Herb Weiner the next one on your
                        list?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, Herb.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The United Kingdom in 1977. His other experience overseas
                        was not in your area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I knew that whenever I called Herb in the United Kingdom and I couldn't
                    get through because he was on a long phone conversation, that Dan Goott was at
                    the other end. No, Herb was a superior officer. I was once there at a Labor Day
                    reception at the ambassador's residence, and I don't think there was a single
                    labor leader in Great Britain of any importance at all who was not at that
                    reception. They obviously were thinking exceedingly highly of Herb. I know that
                    Herb is still in touch with some of these people even today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he is. I've seen evidence of that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: His rapport with his people was extraordinary. The only other thing I'll
                    say about Herb is that he's a terrible driver. Never go through London with him
                    at the wheel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's see. Lloyd White was a little before your time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, I know who he was but. . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Arlen Wilson? He was in Canada in 1988 and in
                        Spain in 1992? You retired about the time he went to Spain.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, he went to Spain hoping to get Italy, but that never panned out.
                    His reporting from Canada, but that's the nature of the job really, was
                    primarily economic. He took very good care of visitors, and he was very good
                    about picking up the phone and advising me of people who might be heading this
                    way whom we should be aware of. Aside from being a good communicator, I can't
                    say anything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Ed Woltman comes up next. You had a lot of contact
                        with Ed.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>HOLMES: I remember Ed both from Germany, where he was an assistant in 1967 and
                    Denmark, when we had a labor attach� conference there. I also visited him
                    another time, but I never visited him in Austria. He had some family problems in
                    Austria. One of his kids was giving him trouble, I guess. But I thought Ed was a
                    very thoughtful person. He always had very good relations with everybody in the
                    embassy. I thought his reporting was timely. I can't think of any problems he
                    had at the posts where I saw him. He was particularly well wired in in Bonn with
                    the youth groups. I remember once going out with him one evening, and he
                    obviously knew everybody who was significant in the youth movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wilbur Wright was in the Netherlands and Belgium in
                        1979.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I knew Wilbur here when he worked in the Labor Department. This was a
                    time when they were having a big hassle about whether we should have a labor
                    attach� in the Netherlands, and they moved him down to Brussels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, because it was a sort of a regional job when it moved
                        to Belgium or maybe to the Netherlands.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: That's right. I don't know, I have the feeling Wilbur, for whatever
                    reason, didn't ever quite get his feet on the ground as a labor attach�. I guess
                    his subsequent assignments were over with USIA in Italy or something like
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Arnold Zempel. You had some contact with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, I know Arnold because he was running this shop when I joined it. I
                    really have nothing I can say about his OECD assignment. I don't remember
                    anything about it. I thought that Arnold was a very thoughtful person when he
                    was here and that he somehow got railroaded out into the Labor Attach�
                    Corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to the beginning of your list, since we
                        started on those with five or more assignments and now we're picking up
                        other people you might have known. Let's see if there's any you want to
                        comment on that we haven't discussed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, there's Harold Aisley, I suppose.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Who I remember from Denmark and Turkey. I thought he did a very
                    workmanlike job. I know he had trouble in Turkey, particularly because of his
                    spouse, because of the pollution.</p>
                <p>Q: Oh, yes. I think courageously he took a second tour there even though she had
                    health problems, and so he stayed on an extra tour.</p>
                <p>HOLMES: George Anderson was a fellow unique unto himself. Maybe he should have
                    been agricultural attach�, I don't know. The problem with George was he
                    basically had no sympathy for labor, which was reflected both in his contacts
                    when you went to visit him and also in his reporting. I remember visiting him
                    once in Belgium and he was talking more about corporation and monopolies than he
                    was talking about anything in the trade union movement. I'm not sure how much
                    George Anderson knew about the ICFTU when he was accredited to Belgium. But
                    still I had the feeling that he should really never have been a labor
                    attach�.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another problem in Belgium: They made him the drug
                        coordinator. At that time it was a very high item. He spent over half his
                        time on drugs. He was in Austria when he offended a high official of the
                        AFL-CIO, perhaps Lane Kirkland, who was then the Secretary-Treasurer.
                        Anderson made some comments that made the AFL-CIO leader think he was
                        anti-labor.</hi>

                <p>HOLMES: This reminds me of Tom Bowie. Tom, of course, was a regular Foreign
                    Service officer, and the reason he became so intimate with the AFL-CIO was that
                    the first time after he arrived in Paris and George Meany came to Europe—this
                    was still the age of the steamship—when George Meany debarked in France, who was
                    at the bottom of the gangplank but Tom Bowie. Ever since then, the AFL-CIO had
                    no problems with Tom Bowie. I remember first meeting Tom Bowie because he came
                    over for a briefing on the French labor scene, and after I got through talking
                    with him, I said to myself, my God, for the first time I am talking to somebody
                    who knows less about labor in France than I do. But in both Rome and Paris, his
                    reporting was superb; his entree in the trade union movement was flawless; and
                    he certainly knew his way around Rome. He was one of those officers who was
                    always at the bottom of the gangplank and who never left the airport until after
                    the wheels were up, because he said, “Particularly in Rome, you have too many
                    people coming back on you.”</p>
                <p>Q: Tom Bowie about set a record for Rome, about 11 years, I think, from 1961 to
                    1972.</p>
                <p>HOLMES: That was because of his wife's illness.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, partly because of his wife's illness. At one point
                        he was going to come out. He had been there about nine years, and the Labor
                        Department, George Weaver, nominated Lou Silverberg to go to Rome. George
                        Meany didn't like George Weaver, and for that reason or for some other
                        reason, did not want Lou Silverberg in Rome. So these were the days when
                        relations with the Italian trade union movement were sensitive, so George
                        Meany wrote to the ambassador in Italy and said, “Don't you think that Tom
                        Bowie should be extended for another tour?” and the ambassador said, “Sure.”
                        So he was extended another two years, partly as a counter-proposal, a
                        preemptive strike by George Meany, which is kind of illustrative of some of
                        the questions the oral history program has on how labor assignments get made
                        and what are the interests of the AFL-CIO.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, if you want to have an insight into how labor attach� assignments
                    are made, another fellow you might look up is Jack Muth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, we discussed him before but didn't get into that
                        aspect of it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, we didn't. Quite clearly his career was influenced by his strong ties
                    with the AFL-CIO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That certainly helped some labor attach�s, but others had
                        their careers hurt by their relations with AFL-CIO.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Or non-relations, yes.</p>
                <p>Q: Going down the list of labor attach�s, are there any we didn't talk about
                    before that you want to comment on?</p>
                <p>HOLMES: I thought John Becker always did a workmanlike job. It seemed to be the
                    impression that while he was in India he had some kind of problem, but then if
                    he did, you would know about it. I don't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't recall any particular problem he had in India, but
                        he went to Austria and then Canada.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, another one of those Canada assignments and retirement, I suppose.
                    At the time of the labor attach� conference in Vienna, I got the impression that
                    he was very well wired in. His immediate superior, with whom he may have been on
                    very good terms, turned out to be a dud, but that's another story.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anybody else on this page that we haven't discussed that
                        you wish to comment on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, there was Ellen Boneparth, who, I guess, was a product of trying to
                    integrate women into the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Greece now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Basically a women's libber. I think frankly she was more preoccupied with
                    the role of women in society than she was with labor matters, which her
                    reporting also reflected. I knew Brayshaw, but I [don't have anything to say
                    about him]. I don't remember much about Tom Byrne when he was in London, to be
                    honest with you.</p>
                <p>Q: Tom Byrne. Well, I can recall that when he went on a lateral entry assignment
                    to Ghana, his first assignment in the Foreign Service, he did such a good job
                    there in Ghana that the African Bureau made him DCM in Dar Es Salaam. Then not
                    long after, he was made labor attach� in London, and then he came back to
                    Washington for a number of important labor assignments.</p>
                <p>HOLMES: He was ambassador too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, two times ambassador. One was in Norway and the other
                        was in Prague. What's the next one, Gerry, you want to comment on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I know all of these guys, but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have anything particular to say about them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Forrester was a lost cause in the OECD job. He tried to get another labor
                    assignment but he didn't get it. I don't understand it. The guy came out of the
                    trade union movement, but somehow he didn't make it. I know something about his
                    consular assignment in Malmo, but. . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here's one I know that's on the following page, Dale Good,
                        although he didn't have five assignments. He had four labor attach�
                        assignments, Greece in 1952, Israel in 1957, Austria in 1964, Germany in
                        1968, in addition to being S/IL.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, he was one of those people who came out of the trade union
                    movement. One of Dale's problems from where I sat was his relationship with the
                    Labor Department. To what extent this was affected by16th Street, I have no
                    idea, but he always managed to kind of pooh-pooh the Labor Department.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, I mentioned this maybe on the Howard Samuel tape, but I think with the
                    Labor Department and him, Howard Samuel was so active in the Labor Department
                    that Dale Good was in a difficult position vis-�-vis to retain his leadership,
                    because that was the time also when ILAB had some funds and Howard Samuel wasn't
                    averse to using them on projects from labor attach� conferences to foreign labor
                    country digests and several other aspects. So he was very, very active, Howard
                    was.</p>
                <p>HOLMES: Maybe Dale resented this, but his labor reporting was good, and I don't
                    really have any feel for his Austrian and German assignments particularly.</p>
                <p>I remember Dan Goott because I visited him in France. I worked with him for a
                    long time, because he was the EUR labor advisor in State. I don't know just why
                    Dan Goott got himself transplanted to France, but Dan Goott was still taking
                    language lessons when I visited him. Dan Goott was one of those officers who
                    wouldn't speak the language until he was perfect in it. He was always afraid of
                    making mistakes. So actually, although Dan Goott was the labor attach� in Paris,
                    I found that he handed me over to Russ Heater, who at the time was the assistant
                    labor attach�. I guess after he came back from France, Dan faded out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's see. Is there anybody else? I guess we covered
                        most of those who served in Europe. Do you see anybody else you want to
                        comment on that we haven't discussed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Kaukonen was a pretty unorthodox officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jorma Kaukonen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I remember his assignment in Sweden, not so much in Canada. He played a
                    very active role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I heard a story about him in Sweden that he learned
                        cross-country skiing, or skiing of some kind, and placed in some national
                        competition.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I wouldn't be surprised.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>Q: Of course, Kaukonen is now more famous for being the father of a Jefferson
                    Airplane guitar player. There was also a story about him when he was assigned to
                    Manila as labor attach�. I don't know if it's true or not. There was a big AID
                    labor mission there, and he had a staff meeting of all the people on the various
                    staffs and said in effect, “I want you to know that I have forgotten more about
                    Philippine labor than any of you will ever know.” At least that's how it came
                    over to the people who were there. Some said it was probably true, but it wasn't
                    a particularly good way to get the cooperation of his staff.</p>
                <p>Now, Gerry, you had some comments you wanted to make on some groups in the Labor
                    Department.</p>
                <p>HOLMES: I felt during my years in the Labor Department there were two groups who
                    often did more harm than good to labor attach�s. The first group was in the late
                    1950s and early 1960s which I refer to as the “right or wrong, my labor attach�"
                    group. This group felt that if a labor attach� didn't get promoted, he was the
                    victim of prejudice. Well, there certainly was plenty of reason for this
                    paranoia, because in those days the Foreign Service was exceedingly elitist.
                    Also, the Foreign Service has never resolved the conflict between generalists
                    and specialists, and labor attach�s always had the problem that, even if there
                    wasn't a bias against labor, still there may be a bias against specialists. Now
                    it so happens that not all labor attach�s are perfect, and those of us who
                    worked on selection boards knew that there was a very good reason why X didn't
                    get promoted, and it was not the result of prejudice or anything else. The
                    people in the Labor Department who kept pounding on this issue merely gave Labor
                    Department representatives on the selection board the image of special
                    pleaders.</p>
                <p>I remember one instance of someone who doubled his income when he went into the
                    Foreign Service. Either he was underpaid or something in his first job or he was
                    overpaid in his second. The man simply was not Foreign Service material. When he
                    did not get promoted, there were very good reasons. I think Labor Department
                    people who kept insisting that all labor attach�s were perfect did the Labor
                    Attach� Corps a disservice.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>The second group some later years consisted mostly of domestic officers in the
                    Labor Department although, sad to say, sometimes also the head of ILAB. These
                    people thought labor attach�s had nothing better to do than sit abroad and wait
                    for the Labor Department to ask for something, and when they didn't have it the
                    next morning, they would pound the desk and scream about “What are our labor
                    attach�s doing?” Labor attach�s had a lot of other duties besides labor. They
                    were acting DCM's, acting political officers, and there were some good reasons
                    why they couldn't produce something the next morning. This sort of talk led to
                    “Well, let's take over our labor attach�s.” Of course, this was non-starter,
                    because no Secretary of Labor really was interested in taking it over, and the
                    Labor Department experience with the Saudi vocational training project would
                    suggest that the Labor Department would have been incapable of administering the
                    foreign labor attach� program in the first place. So I thought this was a
                    non-starter. This particular group sometimes was reformed, because some of these
                    domestic officers would go overseas and they would be received by labor
                    attach�s. A wonderful program was going to be arranged for them. The visit was a
                    great success, and no more was heard about “let's take over the labor attach�
                    program.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would say “Amen,” Gerry. Those are very good comments,
                        and thank you very much for your time.</hi>
