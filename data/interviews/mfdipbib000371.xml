                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>Today is the 21st of May 1992. This is an interview with Thomas W. Fina on behalf
                    of the Foreign Affairs Oral History Program. I am Charles Stuart Kennedy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tom, I wonder if you could give me an idea of your
                        background? When were you born? Where were you born? And a bit about where
                        you grew up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: I was born in Pennsylvania, March 25, 1924, and attended public schools
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where in Pennsylvania?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: Allentown. Allentown is in the heart of the Pennsylvania Dutch country and
                    when I first started to go to school up in the country, it was in a one-room
                    school house built in 1863. There were a number of children in that school,
                    which numbered no more than about 25, who spoke no English, only Pennsylvania
                    Dutch. It was commonly used by the street car conductors, the hucksters, farmers
                    - even many of the older professionals - my dentist. I would ask my grandparents
                    and uncles, who spoke it readily, to teach me Pennsylvania German, but that
                    never got very far. They didn't have the time and I got along perfectly well in
                    English. So I grew up speaking the adopted language of the new world.</p>
                <p>Then my family moved to Winchester, Massachusetts. I attended the Winchester high
                    school, and then we moved again to Needham, Massachusetts, and I graduated from
                    the Needham high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your father doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>FINA: My original father was an immigrant from Italy. He came here as an infant
                    around the turn of the century. He died when I was quite young, and my mother
                    had already divorced him. The Pennsylvania German-Dutch background which she
                    came from, and the southern Italian society from which he came apparently didn't
                    mix all that well. So, unfortunately, I've had very little to do with the Fina
                    side of my family, although I discovered on the other side of my family (the
                    Witmers) that some of ancestors came here in the early 1700s from Alsace
                    Lorraine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Boston.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: In Boston. Well, after high school in Needham, I entered Northeastern
                    University Business School. I only had one year, which was entirely liberals
                    arts. But it was a wonderful year that excited me about history, government,
                    economics, the arts. Then, I entered the armed forces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. What year was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: This was in 1943, and I had enlisted in the Enlisted Reserve Corps which
                    had some benefits. At any rate at the end of my first academic year I was called
                    up, and brought into the Air Force where by virtue of their needs, and perhaps
                    my aptitudes, I got into radio mechanics. So my career in the Air Force was
                    largely as a radio technician, something which I actually enjoyed very much.
                    That technical background is something which stuck with me and been useful to my
                    Foreign Service career. You'd be surprised how many places around the world
                    you're the only one who knows how to fix an electric motor, or fix the
                    refrigerator, or do other things like that when there aren't professionals
                    available. Even though radio technology (this was before the transistor or TV or
                    even tape recording!) has changed so fast, I still enjoy the technical side.</p>
                <p>Then I served in AACS (Army Airways Communications System) with the Air
                    Force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Down around Foggia and that area there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: I landed in Naples. Foggia was a big bomber base, and I was with the Air
                    Force communications system (AACS - Army Air Force Communication System) which
                    provided point-to-point communications for the Air Transport Command. And we
                    also provided something called the Instrument Landing System—ILS- and radio
                    range navigation equipment.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>I ran the Instrument Landing System and radio range in various places. I opened
                    up a radio range station in Florence as the smoke was clearing away, and had a
                    wonderful winter in Florence—no lights in the city, no traffic. By moonlight one
                    could imagine himself in Renaissance Florence. I made a Florentine friend there
                    whom I have to this day although he is now a retired banker in Milan!. It was
                    here that I started to learn Italian. He and I exchanged language lessons. To
                    judge by his English and my Italian today, he had the better teacher and I the
                    better student. During this phase of the war, I moved on first to Pisa to set up
                    a radio range station there and then, when the Germans surrendered in the north,
                    I was moved to Milan when the Po Valley was opened up. I set up our station at
                    Linate, which was the big civilian airport in Milan, and established myself in
                    the Castello Peschiera Borromeo which was one of a number of Borromeo castles,
                    this one complete with a moat and drawbridge, on the eastern outskirts of the
                    city of Milan. Fortunately it is directly in line with the main runway at Linate
                    so I was able to put up our station there and at the same time live in this
                    lovely place with a very wonderful old housekeeper, and deepen my attachment to
                    Italy which had already become pretty pervasive.</p>
                <p>When the war closed down, I was transferred to a base in the American Zone
                    outside of Vienna- -(Tulln)—we had to go through the Russian Zone to get into
                    Vienna. I had a wonderful couple of months during the winter of Beethoven's
                    125th birthday celebrations. Vienna was stark, cold, the people were suffering a
                    great deal. The occupation was terrible for many of them although the war was
                    finally over. It was remarkable that the Vienna Philharmonic went right on
                    playing in the concert hall, and I went to concerts every time I could get into
                    Vienna. It was there that I heard my first performance of Fidelio and I guess
                    saw some of my earliest ballets (Coppelia). The Russians were enthusiastic about
                    the ballet. I was sorry when I was informed that I was going home. I decided I
                    was going to come back to Europe as fast as I could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, our generation of the Foreign Service was
                        heavily influenced by military service, once they tasted it. I mean, how do
                        we get back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: Well, I had no particular desire to get back into the brown suit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, no, no, no.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>FINA: I was glad enough to say goodbye to the Air Force although it had been a
                    very rewarding experience. Seeing these thousands of men working together with
                    no pecuniary motivation to push them. They worked day and night. It isn't that
                    they were particularly motivated by hatred or a passion for war. They were doing
                    a job that they thought was important and they had a sense of participation in
                    it. That was an unforgettable experience for me. Furthermore, the Armed Forces
                    were the first real exposure that I got to the multiplicity and the complexity
                    of our own society. I'd never known blacks before. I'd never known either very
                    educated people, nor very uneducated people, and in the Armed Forces you got to
                    know both. The racial segregation that existed in the Second World War was a
                    real fact, and I kept getting into trouble because I was very much opposed to
                    the segregation of blacks and whites. I remember in Caserta (near Naples) which
                    was the headquarters for the European Command, or at any rate for the
                    Mediterranean command for a while, there was a huge reflecting pool behind the
                    royal palace...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. In cascades.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: Exactly. I see you know it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was Consul General in Naples for a little while,
                        yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: In any event there is a long reflecting pool, and it actually had water in
                    it—some things were still functioning in Caserta. And in keeping with the
                    etiquette of the Armed Forces at that time, the reflection pool was segregated.
                    There was an MP on either side, and on one side of the invisible line across the
                    pool the blacks swam, and on the other side the whites.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Incredible!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: And ne'er the twain should meet because you had MPs separating them. Well,
                    I'd gotten a taste of that in Biloxi, Mississippi in basic training and thought
                    it was pretty awful. And then on various other occasions I went out of my way to
                    sit with black troops at mess halls, and that got me into some trouble, but it
                    was an eye opener to see that these other Americans—after all, all of them
                    descendants of slaves not too many years before the Second World War, very few
                    years, were still being treated in what seemed to me to be a way contrary to
                    everything that we were out there fighting for. Well, that's an aside but it was
                    one of the benefits that I derived from my military experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>After being returned to the United States, I entered Harvard. I decided that
                    Northeastern was interesting but not interesting enough. I had done well enough
                    at Northeastern that I could claim to have the academic qualifications to enter
                    a more demanding school. So I started a campaign of sending telegrams and
                    writing letters to the Director of Admissions at Harvard, applying for admission
                    well before I knew when I was going to be mustered out, but when I could see
                    that I was going to survive the war barring some accident, so I peppered them
                    with my cable communications, and despite many discouraging messages, in the end
                    they caved in, and admitted me.</p>
                <p>So I went back to the university at Harvard. I must have gone back in '46 because
                    I registered in Harvard the day my to-be wife graduated from Wellesley. I went
                    to Wellesley for her graduation in the morning, and then zipped into Cambridge,
                    and registered for my own returning to school. I remained at Harvard, where I
                    majored in government, graduated magna cum laude and then entered graduate
                    school in Arts &amp; Sciences in the International Affairs Program, with a
                    specialization in Italy. And that was really the course of least resistance
                    because having been in Italy for part of the war, I had learned enough Italian
                    that I could get around. I had known none when I arrived. I remember arriving in
                    Naples, our troop ship had dropped anchor during the night. We got up on deck in
                    the morning and there was Vesuvius against the morning sky. I turned to the guy
                    next to me, Gene Edstam, (who is now an architect in Washington state), and
                    said, “How do you say yes and no in Italian?”</p>
                <p>So it was after having spent a couple of years in Italy, where I studied when I
                    could, that I figured the easiest language to meet my language requirement in
                    college was Italian, and having the language and being interested in Italy, I
                    went on and on. Well, that got me to studying with Gaetano Salvemini.</p>
                <p>Salvemini was a famous Italian anti-Fascist, and one of the leaders of the
                    anti-Fascist movement, a great anticleric—I shouldn't mention that here in the
                    halls of Georgetown University! an historian who came to Harvard during the
                    Fascist period. I decided I'd write a paper, my honor thesis, I guess, on some
                    aspect of Italian affairs. And my faculty adviser said, “Look, you ought to take
                    this over to Salvemini because he knows more about these questions than anybody
                    else around here.” And I hit it off with Salvemini very well. He was an elderly
                    man, already in his late '70s, a great scholar and a wonderful man. He had
                    written one of the great books about the French revolution and knew everything
                    about contemporary Italy. He was an acerbic critic of the policies of the United
                    States with respect to post-war Italy. He and Georgio La Piana, who had been
                    defrocked because of his support for the modernist movement in the ''20s, were
                    great friends. La Piana was Professor of Church History at Harvard, so I saw a
                    good bit of them both and tutored with La Piana in church history. I was very
                    much interested in church history and still am, although as an atheist, I came
                    at it differently than La Piana.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>So that led me to graduate from the International Affairs Program with a
                    specialization in Italian affairs, European affairs. I then spent a summer at
                    the Middlebury Scuola Italiana to try get my spoken Italian into more useful
                    shape. By that time I was married—we were married in 1946. Then I got a Harvard
                    traveling fellowship to go to Italy for the summer. My wife and I started in
                    Palermo and worked our way north through Turin interviewing people from top to
                    bottom.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a theme, or purpose, in this traveling
                        fellowship?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: I forget what the theme was, it had something to do with the contemporary
                    political situation. Salvemini had kindly written me letters of introduction to
                    everybody who counted which was just an indescribable advantage. That included
                    Don Luigi Sturzo, the founder of the Partito Populare the original Christian
                    Democratic Party of Italy, and various anarchists, socialists, and people all
                    over the spectrum as a result of that. And then it was a time when you could
                    just knock on doors and introduce yourself saying, “I'm a student studying
                    post-war Italy,” and all kinds of people would let you in. I went to Rome, went
                    around and knocked on doors of various ministries. I met all kinds of people and
                    they were very, very nice. I remain friends with some of them to this day. They
                    were a little surprised at this young student appearing out of nowhere, getting
                    by the various portinai and uscierei, and other obstacles. I must have seen a
                    couple of hundred people. I ran from interview to interview. My main objective
                    was to get to know as many people as I could, and understand what they were
                    saying. I ended up with a lot of stuff. Anyway, that was a very good
                    introduction to Italy—for my wife too since she had never been abroad
                    before.</p>
                <p>Then I got a Fulbright scholarship, the first year of Fulbright scholarships to
                    Italy. It made it possible for me to go to Florence in 1950, and Salvemini had
                    then returned there and that's why I decided to go to Florence so that I could
                    continue to work with him on my thesis. We set ourselves up there in an
                    under-heated suite of rooms in an ancient palazzo (the palazzo Frescobaldi)
                    which was a fantastic experience. I proceeded with my research on the Marshall
                    Plan in Italy including interviews to get to know people, etc. I attended some
                    classes but they were very disappointing because the quality of Italian
                    classroom work at that time was not challenging for an American. It seemed to me
                    that in intellectual terms their economics teaching was outmoded. Keynesianism
                    had not yet been accepted in the Italian classroom or elsewhere!. So the few
                    courses that I attended were on Italian history. The Italians knew more, and
                    were a lot more sophisticated about their own history than they were on most
                    other things that interested me. That was a good experience although I was
                    handicapped by not having a really native command of Italian.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>After my Fulbright scholarship came to an end, I returned to the United States,
                    after having swung around Europe on the money we saved from our Fulbright
                    stipend—we went to France, Switzerland, and Italy. I don't remember whether we
                    hit Spain that time or not, and England, before we came back to the United
                    States. By then, I had applied for a job with the Department of State in the
                    Office of Intelligence Research—OIR which was descended from OSS—Office of
                    Strategic Services, the analysis branch of OSS. OSS was split up after the war
                    with the analysis branch going to State and the rest becoming CIA. And there I
                    was hired by Clinton Knox, who was a black Ph.D. from Harvard, a very able man
                    who later became an ambassador, and who unfortunately subsequently died at a
                    rather early age.</p>
                <p>My field was Italian and Vatican political and economic affairs. We were located
                    in an old apartment building at 23rd and Virginia - now part of the access road.
                    It had no air conditioning at first, but a wonderful view out over the Potomac
                    River, and over what was then already New State.</p>
                <p>There were two sides of the work. One was the so-called NIS work—National
                    Intelligence Surveys—which were prepared under contract for CIA as part of its
                    preparation of studies of all major countries of the world, particularly those
                    in which we thought we had some geopolitical interest at this time of great
                    agitation about the communist threat. The NIS work was the most scholarly and,
                    for me, the less interesting in some respects. Most of my work was in the
                    current intelligence field, that is, what's going on in Italy, and why is it
                    going on. There were various formats in which that kind of information was
                    conveyed to the Secretary of State, and presumably to the President, and other
                    people. I worked primarily on that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>The climate then was a very difficult climate. It was the McCarthy period. It was
                    the period of Cohn and Schine, McCarthy's two staffers who had terrified the
                    Foreign Service around the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had gone on a trip which was comic, except that it
                        was so tragic with antics. They were two very young men who were attacking
                        USIA libraries around the world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: It was the period when Mr. McCarthy was finding communists, homosexuals,
                    and all sorts of other deviates everywhere. It ended up, of course, that one of
                    his principal collaborators, Mr. Schine, who was busy rooting out homosexuals
                    was a homosexual himself, and eventually died. It seems to me of AIDS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he did.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>FINA: That was part of the incredible—I won't say cynicism— but falsity of this
                    period. We were all under the gun on McCarthyism. We knew that McCarthyism was
                    blowing down our necks. And I came into the Department just before the change of
                    administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was from the Truman administration to the
                        Eisenhower.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: And in the Department the transition from Secretary Acheson to Secretary
                    Dulles. I remember, Secretary Acheson, in his final days, invited the staff to
                    come to say goodbye to him, if it wanted to. He received people in his office in
                    State and anyone who wanted to go over and say goodbye, could come over - which
                    I did. I certainly had a very high opinion of Mr. Acheson. It seems to me he had
                    spoken to Department employees in some way, I can't remember quite how it
                    happened, but he had a very elegant, dignified, patrician approach to government
                    and what we had been doing. So I certainly wanted to make my obeisance to the
                    outgoing Secretary of State for whom I had very great admiration. In the event,
                    you had 38 seconds to shake his hand, and, “Wish you well, Mr. Secretary.”</p>
                <p>Shortly thereafter, the new Secretary of State, Mr. John Foster Dulles, was
                    installed, and he convoked the Department to a parking lot somewhere behind the
                    Department of State at the time, a big macadam area. He announced his taking
                    over the job in a rather unbecoming way. It was slightly menacing, expected
                    loyalty from everyone, with the implication of a lot of doubt about our
                    loyalty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He talked about “positive loyalty”. That was a phrase that
                        one remembered for years afterwards.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: In some respects it was a chilling experience after what we had known with
                    Secretary Acheson. In fact, later as I knew Dulles just a very, very little bit,
                    he was a somewhat different kettle of fish, I thought. But this had a very
                    negative impact upon all of us, I think, as he introduced his new team, or at
                    least some of the members of the new team. I guess the thing that stands out
                    best in my mind, is that he introduced some guy who was the chief executive
                    officer, or senior officer, of the Quaker Oats Company, who was going to be the
                    new Under Secretary for Administration, or whatever it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His name was Stewart, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>FINA: I don't recall. Secretary Dulles said that he was a great guy, with much
                    experience, and had been a terrific quarterback on the somebody or else team.
                    Well, I guess I, and I imagine a good many others, thought that was one of the
                    funnier ways of recommending a senior officer for a high position in the
                    Department of State. But it was sort of the tone of the new team which didn't
                    generate much enthusiasm. He didn't last. I think he was there for a few months,
                    and then he went back to rolling oats, or something. But the atmosphere was one
                    of, how bad can things get? I remember one day when there was so much talk about
                    things that McCarthy was doing to the Department—sending Cohn and Schine in to
                    check and find all those commies who were around there—I went up to my boss's
                    office, Clinton Knox, and said, “Hey boss, we're in trouble. They're back there
                    in my office disconnecting the phone and taking out my desk. I think this
                    McCarthyism has gone too far.” And for a half minute I think Knox actually
                    believed it, he was out of his chair and toward the door before he realized that
                    this was a joke. But it was indicative of the climate of the time, where it just
                    seemed that the craziness of these allegations was actually getting down to
                    ordinary people. I mean us poor little analysts who were working on interpreting
                    election returns abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, I mean Italy not too long ago had gone
                        through this climatic election of 1948 where it seemed to be very much in
                        doubt whether the communists would take over or not, and with massive
                        infusion of American money and all sorts of assistance, and the formation of
                        the Christian Democrats, they didn't. Looking at this, since we considered
                        it a very touchy situation in Italy, but did you find this affected your
                        reporting, this whole atmosphere, or how we looked at things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: My recollection, and in the absence of what I wrote at the time, one has to
                    be prudent, but my recollection is that I didn't feel that the Communists were
                    going to take over Italy. That seemed to me highly improbable. The only way that
                    that might have occurred would have been if they had come to power politically.
                    I don't think that I believed that a military threat was real at that time. And
                    I don't think that I saw the possibility, or the likelihood, of their winning a
                    majority. However, it was a very serious question, and there's no doubt that we
                    were all genuinely worried about the Communist Party which appeared to be very
                    closely tied to the Soviet Union through the Comintern, through the Yugoslav
                    connection. There was no doubt in my mind at the time that Palmiro Togliatti and
                    the other principal Italian Communists were linked to the Soviet Union.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>I remember having interviewed one of Togliatti's close collaborators, one of his
                    vice chairs, I guess, when I had been in Rome as a student, and it was a very
                    conspiratorial business. I wrote a letter asking for an interview at the Via
                    Botteghe Oscure, which was the headquarters of the Communist Party in Rome, and
                    it took a long time, and many telephone calls before I was finally granted an
                    interview. There were the usual security guards at the front door, and I was
                    taken to a very small sparsely furnished little room, and eventually this
                    unsmiling middle aged man, who I guess at that time was the number two in the
                    party, appeared by himself, and wanted to know what I wanted. All this was
                    conducted in Italian, my Italian was hardly...well, no one would have confused
                    me for a native born Italian! Nevertheless, I was perfectly competent to conduct
                    an interview. I didn't get much out of that interview except the feeling that
                    these people really saw the world divided, and that they were committed to the
                    Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>(machine turned off)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying your impression was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: My impression about the Communists was that this was serious business and
                    they were absolutely our adversaries. But the other thing that I came to early
                    on in my experience in the Department of State on this subject was, that the
                    Communists and the Socialists were not the same thing. And that is really the
                    fundamental marker in my experience in the Department of State at that time. I
                    concluded that the Communists and the Socialists could be split, and I thought
                    that was the thing that should be done in the interest of the United States.
                    That the main way to assure that the Communists would not come to power legally
                    in Italy- -and I didn't think they could come to power illegally—would be to
                    deprive them of their alliance with the Socialist Party which gave them a very
                    big hunk of the vote. I reached that conclusion on the basis of my interviews
                    with people in Italy, my studies in Italy, my study of the information that was
                    available to me as an intelligence research analyst, at the time. The key to all
                    this was that the Communist Party had made an alliance with the Socialist Party
                    in Italy, that those two would function as one in the interest of the working
                    classes, and all the methodology, and all the serious commitment which they had
                    to reform Italian society constituted a very large block of the vote, very
                    powerful. The question was, were they really the same thing? The position taken
                    by the conservatives in the Department of State, and in the United States, and
                    in the Administration, was that the Communists and Socialists were the same.
                    Socialists were Communists.</p>
                <p>This simplistic political analysis that was prevalent in the United States at
                    that time, had antecedents in the Bolshevik revolution during the First World
                    War. The Bolsheviks claimed they were socialists. That certainly put a cloud
                    over the socialist movement which was by no means ideologically, authoritarian,
                    dictatorial, or anything but democratic.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>But what had happened in Italy by this time was, that the Communists and the
                    Socialists had been the most aggressive and the most disciplined people in the
                    underground fighting the Fascists and Germans. During the war the Christian
                    Democrats, (the Catholics), were also active in the underground but perhaps not
                    to the same degree of militancy, but nevertheless very important. These three
                    had an agreement that they would work together in the underground, together with
                    a couple of the minor parties, the Republicans and the Action Party, which was a
                    very important group—small, but very influential in shaping the nature of
                    Italy's post war system of government.</p>
                <p>At war's end, the Communists and the Socialists stuctogether and they split with
                    the Catholics and other minor parties. We took the position—we, the United
                    States, and our Western European allies, the two were now really the same thing:
                    that the Socialists were simply Communist tools, if not willing, or crypto
                    Communists. Well, I didn't think that was true. From what I knew of people in
                    both parties, from personal experience, and from my readings on it, that was
                    simply not true. There was no doubt that the Socialists were deeply committed to
                    their alliance with the Communists primarily (but not only) because they had
                    similar (though not identical ideas) about domestic reform. But it seemed to me
                    the sensible thing to do in geopolitical terms for the United States was to work
                    on separating them. The chance of reducing their votes at the polls I thought
                    was very small. Worthwhile doing but still small. But what really would count
                    would be to have them split. Once they were split the whole dynamic of the
                    Italian political situation would change.</p>
                <p>Those views were supported by, I should say, virtually no one whom I ever met in
                    the Department of State. At a time when Mr. McCarthy and his buddies, the right
                    wing of the Republican party, were taking the position that the Department of
                    State was a bunch of pinkos, my experience was that it was filled with very,
                    very conservative Foreign Service officers, and civil servants, who were if
                    anything right of center, and not left. Now they may have had a much more
                    cosmopolitan view of the world than the Republican and Democratic right. They
                    had a much more sophisticated view of post-war collaboration, the importance of
                    removing some of the causes of the Second World War. They were more supportive
                    of the IMF, of the United Nations, of all those institutions that grew out of
                    our analyses of the causes of the Second World War. And those things had not
                    been accepted by a large part of the Republican Party, certainly not by Mr. Joe
                    McCarthy and his more or less respectable allies who viewed them as a subversion
                    of American values.</p>
                <p>So I thought this was somewhat of a joke. All these attacks on the Department of
                    State for its wild-eyed radicalism, when my experience was that most of my
                    colleagues were very conservative indeed. And therefore anyone who came along to
                    question the orthodoxy of saying Italian Communists and Socialists are really
                    the same thing wasn't likely to find it easy going, nor did I.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask. Here you are sort of a young squirt in...I'll
                        call it INR, I mean how would you make your ideas known? And to whom would
                        you make these ideas known? And how?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: That is one of the great redeeming features of the intelligence community
                    in my view, a tribute to the intellectual quality of the Department of State,
                    and of OIR at that time. My bosses didn't stand in the way of my expounding my
                    analysis of the situation. In fact their position was, we want you to give us
                    your best intellectual analysis of the situation. That's your job. Don't worry
                    about the policy. We don't make policy, but we have an obligation to present the
                    policy makers with the clearest, most objective, analysis of the foreign
                    situation for which we're charged. And we have confidence in your intellectual
                    integrity, and that you know more about it than we do. You write it, we'll
                    critique it, and we'll send it forward. That's your job. You've got the job of
                    the intelligence analyst. Don't worry about whether its politically correct or
                    not. And so the Deputy Division Chief (Clinton Knox) and Dick Scammon (the
                    Division Chief) and the two branch chiefs for whom I worked at that time, Eddy
                    Schodt and __, and another very able economist, who were my immediate bosses,
                    were very severe critics. They were very demanding and they were, I would say,
                    very intellectually competent to question the views of this neophyte civil
                    servant who said he knew what he was talking about in Italy. But they never
                    tried to prevent my stating the views, they just insisted that (a) it be written
                    in an effective way, clearly, unambiguously, and (b) that I be able to justify
                    everything I said. So it was a very tough exercise.</p>
                <p>But in terms of the system, the system said, yes, we want you to give us your
                    unvarnished views. Well, the result was that as far as the intelligence
                    organization went, I got good grades. The Assistant Secretary at the time,
                    during the Acheson period, and maybe during the Dulles period too, was a man
                    named W. Parker Armstrong. An investment banker, an East Coast liberal
                    Republican, I assumed. A very impressive man. And pretty soon I began to get
                    little notes back on my intelligence memoranda from various people higher in the
                    organization, saying nice things.</p>
                <p>Then, over the period of time that I worked there, little by little, I guess
                    people increased their confidence in my work, and I was invited to be on the
                    morning briefing team for the Assistant Secretary for Intelligence, Mr.
                    Armstrong, who always had a briefing—I think it was 7:00 or 8:00 in the morning
                    before he went in to see the Secretary, to gave him a morning briefing. That was
                    an interesting experience too.</p>
                <p>My entire period working on Italian affairs was dominated by the Communist
                    Socialist issue, and while the intelligence people were willing to have this
                    view presented to the policy people, the policy people did not want to hear of
                    it. They not only didn't want to read it, they didn't want it written. So I was
                    in constant, or frequent, conflict with the Italian Desk in the Bureau of
                    European Affairs - the policy part of the Department.</p>

                <p>FINA: Well, the Italian desk has the responsibility for backstopping the embassy.
                    It was the policy side of the Department of State, staffed by career Foreign
                    Service officers. I don't remember all the names, Bill Knight was one of the
                    officers with whom I differed over a period of years, in a nice enough way. But
                    he was firmly opposed to the views that I expressed about the Italian situation,
                    and so was his boss who was a great deal more important. (tape stopped) Suffice
                    it to say that Bill and I were at odds about this, but his boss, the Assistant
                    Secretary for European Affairs—what was his name? He was formerly in Naples, his
                    father had been a CG in Naples.</p>

                <p>FINA: Homer Byington. Homer Byington had, shall we say, even more conservative
                    views on this subject than Bill Knight.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FINA: He and Mrs. Luce. I don't know if you've ever seen Mrs. Luce's airgram—I
                    think it was an airgram—in which she recommended the restoration of the
                    monarchy. Anyway, we had a running debate with them, and then embassy Rome
                    weighed in on the question because eventually they got hold...maybe I or, my
                    office sent them, or my boss..sent copies of this heretical stuff that I was
                    turning out.One of these main areas of conflict was the question of the trade
                    union movement. The Italian trade union movement, at that time, was divided into
                    three general...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It still is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: Yes, they certainly are still there. The Christian Democratic trade union
                    CISL, the Social Democratic UIL, and the CGIL, the Italian Confederation of
                    Labor which was the Communist-Socialist labor movement and the largest. Well, I
                    was very much interested in the trade union movement, and had seen a good bit of
                    those people while I was a student and traveling in Italy. My impression was,
                    wrongly, that CISL would never become a significant trade union organization
                    because of its historical (pre-Fascist) association with yellow (Catholic) trade
                    union movement.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>FINA: They were historically much too close to management, and my feeling was
                    that they didn't have a future in Italy. I thought that the way to break the
                    hold of the CGIL was by supporting the socialist unions, because the socialist
                    unions had the best entree, it seemed to me, to the Italian working class. At
                    that time the socialist trade union was the FIL, the predecessor of the UIL. I
                    had written something about the importance of FIL as a counterweight to the
                    CGIL, in fact I wrote a rather big paper on the subject. That hit the fan and
                    got Tom Lane, who was at that time the Labor Attach� in Rome, to weigh in. Now,
                    the Labor Attach�s at that time, and for all I know to this day, were named by
                    the AFL-CIO, but principally by the AFL, and by their very militantly
                    anti-Communist people back here in Washington.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We can fill that in later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: Anyway, the key Labor Attach�s around Europe at any rate, were all AFL
                    people who had been chosen by the very conservative wing of the AFL. Tom Lane
                    always half kiddingly boasted that he was a card-carrying brick layer. He was a
                    charming man. However, in political terms he had chosen the Catholic union —he
                    was a Catholic himself, if I'm not mistaken—and he was going to do everything he
                    could to make sure that the resources which the United States controlled, and
                    they were considerable, went into support for CISL.</p>
                <p>Consequently, when my little paper came out analyzing the situation and
                    disagreeing with this, that brought down the wrath of the gods on me for that as
                    well. During a visit to Washington Tom dropped in to see me at the Department to
                    straighten me out. He had various black loose leaf binders of clippings which he
                    used for his briefings to show how the socialist union was really nothing more
                    than a tool of the communists. He was quite wrong about that. That was idiocy.
                    But nevertheless he was very successful in convincing the United States
                    Government, and everyone who counted, that that was the case.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>It was about that time, and it seems to me it was 1955, that I came up for an
                    orientation trip. The Department of State—the Office of Intelligence
                    Research—periodically was able to send its analysts to the countries for which
                    they were responsible, for on-the-spot familiarization to get themselves
                    freshened up, find out what was going on, etc. And by some miracle, my bosses
                    decided they would send me to Italy. That required the clearance, of course, of
                    the Italian desk which was very reluctant to see a person of such debatable
                    intellectual orientation going to Italy. And eventually it had to be cleared
                    with Mrs. Luce who by that time was the ambassador. But, nevertheless, it was
                    approved. So I went to Italy on my best behavior. But I intended to see as many
                    people as I could to ferret out what was going on, to inform myself directly,
                    because I was not very confident in the reporting from the embassy, and much
                    less from the consulates. Some of the consulate reports were incredible. I
                    remember one from the Consul General in Turin, in which he reported on going to
                    the horse show and some comments by one of the members of the royal family who
                    was there, that the women really should be wearing corsets. He was shocked at
                    the appearance of these women. That was the sort of reporting that we were
                    getting. But the consulates, of course, were not encouraged to do serious
                    reporting. That got in the way of the embassy, but that's another story that I
                    learned more about later.</p>
                <p>Suffice it to say, I got to Italy. I had met Mrs. Luce back here. She was a very
                    charming woman, funny. But there in the political section in Rome the deputy
                    director of the political section was an officer with whom I had crossed swords
                    back here on the Italian desk. He had been Officer-in-Charge of Italian-Austrian
                    affairs. He was not, one would say, as civilized or gentlemanly as Bill
                    Knight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it Wells Stabler?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: No, this was before Wells, I think. Anyway, he was there. He wanted me to
                    provide a list of the people I was seeing, and what I was doing in Rome. They
                    really wanted me to spend my time in Rome where they could brief me on what was
                    happening from the Embassy point of view. I'm by nature not one to want to be
                    fed pablum, so I spoke to them, made my way around, met people there, discovered
                    that the people in USIA were by far the best informed about what was going on in
                    Italy. The political section certainly was not. I went around and interviewed
                    people in the political parties.</p>
                <p>Now, the CGIL, the Communist Party and the Socialist Party were off-limits. We
                    were not, at this period, permitted even to speak to them. There was no way in
                    which you could go to speak to those people even if you ran into them at a
                    cocktail party which in the American circuit was so unlikely you hardly needed a
                    rule. My impression was that you were to look the other way. Therefore, I made
                    no effort, much to my regret, to see the Communists, or Socialists or the CGIL.
                    However, I did go around to see the Italian Confederation of Manufacturers,
                    which is the CGII. They are on the political spectrum somewhere to the right of
                    the NAM in the United States.</p>

                        conservative...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: ...a very conservative organization nevertheless, very interesting. They
                    had a good statistical office, and they were really worthwhile people with whom
                    to talk. I always find these people have a lot of interesting things to say. The
                    Italians are incredibly articulate, and normally very analytical.</p>
                <p>Well, in reporting to my keeper in the political section about whom I had seen, I
                    wrote down...Dr. somebody, CGII. The next day there was a summons from
                    Ambassador Luce. I was called into her chambers, and she pulled out this piece
                    of paper and said that she understood that I had been forbidden to speak with
                    the communists. “Absolutely, Madam Ambassador, it's certainly too bad, but
                    that's true.” “Well,” she said, “right here you've admitted on this paper that
                    you went to see Dr. somebody of the CGIL.” “That's a mistake”, I replied. “ That
                    isn't CGIL, that's CGII.” Well, someone had changed the “I”, that I had
                    typewritten, to an “L” with a pen, because he, poor dear, had assumed it had to
                    be the CGIL because he, I guess, didn't know there was a CGII. I don't think it
                    was malevolent. I think it was ignorance. That hardly improved the attitude of
                    the political section toward its young visitor from the United States.</p>
                <p>I then went back to my interviewing, and seeing people. Mrs. Luce called me in
                    again and said she didn't think I should travel elsewhere in the country; my
                    presence could be misunderstood, and people would misunderstand. I was pretty
                    mad but really had no leverage. So I asked if I could go to Sardinia? “I'll take
                    a couple of weeks, or a week's vacation in Sardinia.” So my wife and I went to
                    Sardinia, which we had never been to before. I dutifully avoided politics, and
                    we explored the ruins, and visited the beach, and did things like that, and came
                    back to Rome. Then I may have been released to go to visit some other places,
                    and I came back to Rome.</p>
                <p>When it was all over Mrs. Luce called me in again. “Before you go back, what are
                    your conclusions?” Now, talking with people around Italy hadn't changed my mind.
                    It had reinforced my view that the Socialists were eager to separate themselves,
                    or at least a lot of them were eager to separate themselves from the Communists,
                    whom they disliked. And that Pietro Nenni, the head of the Party who was the key
                    to all this, was interested in that.</p>

                <p>FINA: He was the head of the Socialist Party, a man of great repute, who had been
                    Foreign Minister in the Italian government immediately after the war before the
                    split came among the resistance parties. An interesting man, if not the most
                    politically farseeing. While I was in Rome I was in touch with a number of
                    Italian newspaper men. To my way of thinking, the are often the most interesting
                    sources; they know everybody, know all the gossip, and are sophisticated people.
                    Anyway, one of these journalists said that he had told Nenni that I was in town,
                    and Nenni had offered to meet with me. That was pretty seductive. I would have
                    loved to hear what he had to say to the United States. But the embassy answer
                    was, “No,” which didn't surprise me. It disappointed me, but it didn't surprise
                    me. In any event, my impression through various newspaper men, and others whom I
                    met, was that the Socialists really wanted out.</p>
                <p>In view of my conclusions I told Mrs. Luce that I thought that the Communists and
                    Socialists could be split. The alliance could be broken, and it would be in our
                    interest to do so. It would solve this whole problem of whether they could gain
                    a sufficiently large number of votes either to obstruct any movement in Italy,
                    or to impair the ability of Italy to function in NATO. And it would remove the
                    risk of the Communists ever attaining a majority. I said I thought that would be
                    a very worthwhile achievement for the United States. If we could bring that off,
                    we would have done great and good things in the interest of our country.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Luce said two things in reply, as I recall: First, that was something that
                    would take too long to do, and she didn't have much time; what was going to be
                    done she wanted done in the short term. She wanted short term results because
                    she was only going to be Ambassador for a short time. And secondly she said—I
                    can hear her nasal little voice—”Oh, Mr. Fina, you may be a very bright boy, but
                    there's no one else around here who believes that, and I guess we'll just have
                    to wait and see.” Several years later when the split did come, I had the
                    satisfaction, (of no career value!) of receiving a telegram from the CIA Italian
                    analyst to whom I had recounted this episode, that read, “Congratulations bright
                    boy”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about a policy thing that dominated our
                        relations with Italy for decades. My Italian is off, but the aperatura a
                        sinistra, opening to the left. OKAY, this sounds fine, but here's the United
                        States which is not the sovereign power in Italy, I mean this is something
                        for Italians to do. What could the United States do? We're talking at that
                        time...let's say somebody says, “Gee, this would be a good idea,” but what's
                        the United States got to do with the Italians deciding how to configure
                        their political system?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>FINA: It's true, of course, that any of these things have to be done, or will be
                    done, by the people who actually hold power in the country. But the United
                    States there, and in other places in the world, frequently has what you might
                    call the tilting power to shift decisions marginally one way or another. And we
                    had resources at that time, financial resources, political resources, friends,
                    the ability to blackmail, all the things that a great power at the peak of its
                    power traditionally has done dealing with its friends and its enemies. We were
                    placing military contracts, denying military contracts, subsidizing political
                    parties, withdrawing money from political parties, giving money to individual
                    politicians, not giving it to other politicians, subsidizing the publication of
                    books, the content of radio programs, subsidizing newspapers, subsidizing
                    journalists, granting and denying visas. All of the things both of a covert and
                    an overt nature that a great power, at that time, and in the tradition of what
                    the fascists, the communists, the Nazis, the British, and the French, had done
                    before, we were doing in Italy. Clearly we could not have placed a call to the
                    Prime Minister and told him that we thought it was time for something to happen
                    to split the Communists and Socialists. But we could have told him and other
                    leaders in private and used the many means at our disposal to have made it
                    easier to happen. Once we had told Mr. De Gasperi, for example, that we would
                    support the elimination of the Communists and Socialists from the post-war
                    coalition government and that is what happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the Prime Minister, again, and again, and
                        again.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: Yes, a very able, exceedingly competent, politically astute, committed
                    Christian Democrat, as well. If we had told him that we would support a
                    governmental alliance, including the Socialists, that could very well have
                    happened.**</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It could have been almost as simple as Mrs. Luce having
                        Mr. Nenni over for tea. I mean, its such a small society, this would have
                        sent quite a signal.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>FINA: That's right, and when you say it's a small society, it's true. Italy is an
                    astonishing country in which a very small number of people make the decisions.
                    They all know each other, half of them are related to each other, and even
                    though they may be political adversaries, they may be personal friends, or
                    family friends, for many, many years. So it would have been possible to
                    facilitate this. You couldn't have guaranteed it. There was no button you could
                    push that would change the screen so the Communists would come up by themselves.
                    But with the increasing discomfort of the socialists in their alliance with
                    them, and after the increasing demonstration of Soviet brutality in Eastern
                    Europe, there was a willingness within the Socialist Party to realign
                    themselves. And had we shown ourselves disposed to support that, I think it
                    would have moved a lot faster than it did. Eventually, of course, many did split
                    with the Communists, and we had something to do with that. That was during the
                    Kennedy Administration. The Kennedy Administration sent Francis Williamson over
                    to Rome to tell the embassy, “This is the President's policy, we are going to
                    support the aperatura a sinistra.” But I was out of Italian Affairs by then,
                    long since burned by my premature advocacy of trying to split the alliance.</p>
                <p>At any rate, after that interview with Mrs. Luce, I decided that I was wasting my
                    time working on Italian affairs, that I was not going to change the views of
                    Secretary Dulles, or Mrs. Luce, or the conservative career officers who were
                    running our policy. So I asked for a transfer to French Affairs in OIR.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was about 1956, or '55 or so you moved over to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: This was '56 it seems to me, yes, when I went over to French Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our policy considerations in France at that
                        time. This was right after the Geneva Accords. I mean, Algeria was heating
                        up.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>FINA: That's right. I was not really very knowledgeable about France, and the
                    only position I could move into in the French section was working on the
                    National Intelligence Survey. There was a job to write a chapter on the French
                    trade unions. I figured, this is great, I know nothing about them. I'll do a
                    scholarly research job. And that's what I tried to do. In the process I became
                    somewhat familiar with the French political situation, but I never really got
                    involved in the politics of France to the extent that I had been involved with
                    the politics of Italy because I didn't know enough about it. I only did this
                    French work for maybe about a year, and then I became special assistant to the
                    deputy director of INR—maybe it was still OIR at that time—for psychological
                    intelligence, which was the administration, the liaison for preparation of
                    reports for the President's Advisory Committee on Intelligence, coordination of
                    OIR clearances of internal work. The Office of Intelligence Research worked with
                    the rest of the intelligence community, and with the Executive Branch. My job
                    was to analyze pieces of completed intelligence which we received, represent OIR
                    in inter-agency meetings to present our views, and to negotiate them into other
                    papers, to write resumes of finished intelligence to be transmitted to the
                    Secretary, or the President, when they were traveling abroad, liaison with CIA
                    on various special projects. And I guess one of the most interesting things was,
                    to work on the analysis of public opinion surveys prepared by outside
                    contractors of foreign public opinion. There were periodic reports that were
                    funded I guess by USIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: USIA did those, I think, mostly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: But they all came to the Department of State for our review of the
                    analysis, and my job was to look over the analysis, and see whether we agreed
                    with it, or didn't agree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did one start? Did one start with how it should come
                        out, and then look at the analysis. I would think the predisposition of any
                        department would be to say, well, they really should be thinking of the
                        United States as great, and what we're doing is wonderful and should support
                        us. If you get a poll that says it isn't, then you re-analyze the analyses.
                        How did it work, actually?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>FINA: I'm happy to say, I don't think it worked that way. The people at Princeton
                    were doing these polls, the questions were negotiated with the agency in
                    advance, and I think we got a crack at the questions, and then the contractor
                    wrote up an analysis of the results, and sent it around to us for comment. And
                    as far as I can recall, our role in that was just to make sure that the analysis
                    made sense in terms of our familiarity with the country in question. It wasn't
                    trying to change the results. It was a case of trying to make sure that
                    references to one party or another, made sense. There was a question of applying
                    one's specialized knowledge as kind of an editor, or consultant, to somebody
                    else's analysis of the meaning. And we probably also had some impact, or
                    suggestions, about how some things should be interpreted in the light of the
                    fact that some of us, as analysts, were experts on the subject. Because an
                    expert on German affairs, or French affairs, or Italian affairs, might read
                    something different into a series of responses to questions, than someone who is
                    a pollster in Princeton. But there was...I can't conceive of our having tried to
                    change the gravamen of an analysis like that because intellectually we were
                    committed to trying to present what we though was the most balanced picture of
                    the situation we could. That was, after all, our required professional
                    justification.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On these various interviews, these polls that were taken,
                        would policy take these into account do you think, as a sounding of how
                        we're going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: I can't really speak to that, because I was not privy to the policy
                    discussions of those things. Although I attended staff meetings in EUR on the
                    Italian desk when I was working on Italian affairs, I don't remember any
                    discussions of these polls, although there may very well have been some. But the
                    policy people normally, at any rate in situations where they were dealing with
                    me, or I was present, were trying to justify what they had decided the policy
                    was, and therefore they were mainly interested in justification for what they
                    were doing. I never could quite figure out when it was they stopped and thought
                    about what they should be doing in terms of reexamining premises, and looking
                    back inside the motivations for these policies. But that may have been because I
                    wasn't involved in that kind of formulation. That may have gone on amongst
                    themselves when they felt they were talking to people whom they could trust, and
                    in whom they had confidence, that they shared an intellectual approach to these
                    things. So I don't know what influence on policy those polls may have had.</p>

                    choice of either becoming Foreign Service Officers, and therefore being willing
                    to serve abroad, or being, it seems to me, put into a category of people who
                    would serve only in the United States, but therefore had limited career
                    prospects.</p>
                <p>Well, I was glad to be integrated into the Foreign Service although I was unhappy
                    at being converted at what I considered to be an insultingly low grade. I guess
                    I took a salary cut to do so. In any event, I then entered the Foreign Service
                    in 1958 as an FSO-6. And through the good offices of my then boss, who was the
                    deputy director of OIR, a career Foreign Service officer, I was assigned to
                    Paris, to our delegation to the OEEC.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>FINA: The Office of European Economic Cooperation which was an outgrowth of the
                    Marshall Plan in which we had called upon the Europeans to work together to
                    develop coordinated economic plans for the recovery of Europe. We were members
                    of that group. It had evolved a great deal by 1958, of course. But the OEEC was
                    a very lively place where countries presented their plans, and we talked about
                    what was going to happen. We had a staff in the American delegation to the OEEC
                    which looked at what the various countries said they were doing, and what their
                    economies looked like, and critiqued them. Our job was to look at the
                    Netherlands country report, or the Belgium country report, and say, “Ah hah,
                    their GNP has been growing too slowly. They're not going to put enough into
                    infrastructure, or they're unrealistic about this, or their hard currency
                    reserves are growing too fast, and then in the course of the review of that
                    country's report and plan, the United States as well as other countries would
                    raise these questions. I found that a supreme bore because there were too many
                    people in the delegation and I had nothing to do. It seems to me that I had a
                    couple of countries, I had the Netherlands, maybe I had all of Benelux. But it
                    wasn't a job, and while I liked the substance all right, I felt that I was
                    wasting my time. So I went down to see my boss, and asked if there weren't
                    something else to do? He suggested I go to the library and study up on my
                    countries and told me that in Paris there were are a lot of things that I could
                    be doing. Well, that didn't satisfy me. I don't sit around doing nothing very
                    easily. These were nice people, very competent, far better economists than I.
                    They're still my friends. But about that time we had an inspection, and the
                    inspector interviewed all of us peons, and when he got to me, he asked me things
                    inspectors ask, and I said, “Well, I think my job ought to be abolished, because
                    this is a waste of time. We've got too many people here doing this. My job could
                    be merged with two other guys, etc.” A couple of weeks later I was summoned into
                    the presence of the Ambassador. “I understand that you said that we were
                    overstaffed.” He wasn't too happy. What could I tell him? I thought it was a
                    disgrace to waste taxpayer's money in that way. So I told him that he
                    undoubtedly couldn't know what was going on beneath the stairs, but there were
                    just too many people there. Well, presently my job was abolished, which made me
                    very happy.</p>
                <p>But what I wasn't happy with, they transferred me to COCOM. COCOM was the
                    so-called Coordinating Committee. It had a name which was supposed to be
                    completely misleading to everyone. But it was a semi-NATO body, representing all
                    of the NATO states, plus Japan. Its purpose was to maintain an embargo on the
                    shipment of strategic materials to the Soviet Bloc and to China. It was a very
                    busy place. I didn't know much about it, and I was dead set against taking the
                    job, and I resisted. But the Chief of Personnel in Paris said, “You got the
                    job.”</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>So I went around and met my new boss, Hal Levin. He was a very nice and extremely
                    able person whom I hadn't known before. I settled into the job which turned out
                    to be terrific. I had a wonderful time. Not because I was convinced that all of
                    our embargo items made sense. They didn't, but a lot did. But one reason that it
                    was such a good job from my point of view, was that it was so filled with
                    electronic and mechanical technology, all of which interested me very much. And
                    practically no one else knew an electron from a hypoid gear. So I had a fine
                    time. I was fascinated by what we were doing, and it was my first exposure to
                    multilateral negotiation. A lot of language questions were involved too that
                    interested me: what terminology to use in French, because all of our documents
                    were in French and English. What are the proper French terms for the these
                    various English terms? I had a lot of fun with trying to come up with what I
                    thought were really the right French terms because the interpreters were...what
                    shall we say, they were basically liberal arts interpreters. And they really
                    didn't know anything about technology. I found that a very exciting job, and got
                    involved in a very fascinating negotiation about the shipment of communications
                    cable to the Soviet Union, which I guess was the high point of my career in
                    COCOM.</p>
                <p>The French were trying to sell some 16 or 32 pair cable to the Russians, and they
                    were maintaining that it couldn't be used for strategic purposes while we
                    maintained that it could. That went on for months and months, and finally I led
                    the negotiation on a French train going down to Dijon, during which the French
                    were going to demonstrate to us that this cable was used in their rail
                    communications.They brought a bunch of technicians from the railroad, and from
                    the French PTT, the Post and Telegraph. We argued the case all the way down, and
                    we argued the case all the way back. By the time we were approaching Paris they
                    had given in. They agreed to our interpretation of what this communications
                    cable should do, and could do, and what we shouldn't do with it. I think we got
                    in at 3:00 in the morning, and I was absolutely elated because it was a big
                    issue for us and something that I had carried through from the very beginning.
                    As soon as I got home I called Levin at 3:30 in the morning to announce
                    triumphantly that “We won.” “Tell me about it in the morning.” Anyway, that was
                    a very good experience, I enjoyed that very much.</p>
                <p>That assignment came to an end in 1960. Without my having asked, the Department
                    transferred me to Bologna, to the John Hopkins Center of Advanced International
                    Studies. They had a branch there, a school that specialized in European
                    integration affairs, which was run by Prof C. Grove Haines who had been a
                    professor at the School of Advanced International Studies here in Washington.
                    Haines had created this idea of a school that would bring together graduate
                    students from Europe and America in roughly equal numbers together with an
                    international faculty to concentrate on the study of European integration. This
                    was 1960, only two years after the signature of the Treaty of Rome.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>Well, I thought going to Bologna was a great idea, but I didn't believe in
                    European integration. I thought that it was highly improbable. The conflict
                    between the French, the Germans, the Italians, the age-old rivalries seemed to
                    me more likely to prevail than some idealistic scheme. It turned out that my
                    experience in Bologna completely changed my views on that. I left Bologna
                    convinced that the new Europeans really had something. The Bologna Center
                    brought political and academic leaders from all over Western Europe, whom Haines
                    had recruited to give regular lectures on what was going on. They excited me and
                    thrilled me, about what they were doing to deal with the problems of post-war
                    Europe. And since I had been very much interested in European history as an
                    under-graduate student, what they were doing just made so much sense in terms of
                    their interests, and the interests of the United States, that I got very excited
                    about it.</p>
                <p>After that assignment of an academic year in Bologna, I was transferred to
                    Luxembourg, where the United States had a small mission to the European Coal and
                    Steel Community which had been the first of the three community bodies that
                    eventually became the European Community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to go back to this while you were as a student
                        looking at this, but these are future leaders, I mean you were going to be
                        involved in this. What was the view of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union
                        as regards the European situation? Where did they fit in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>FINA: They were clearly adversaries. The Soviet Union appeared to be very
                    monolithic. It was opposed to European unification. The Soviets saw it simply as
                    a tool of NATO, or at least so they described it. They saw it as part of our
                    aggressive effort to destroy, or at any rate to counter their efforts, whatever
                    they may have been. From their point of view, European integration was bad news.
                    There is no doubt that our support for European unification was in part, but I
                    believe only in marginal part, motivated by Cold War considerations. Maybe
                    marginal is too small a proportion, maybe it ought to be half and half as I
                    think more about it. Because our view at the time was, and it had grown out of
                    the analysis of the causes of the Second World War, that somehow you had to find
                    a way of avoiding the conflict between France and Germany. One way of doing this
                    was along the lines of the proposals that had been made by Jean Monnet and
                    picked up by Robert Schuman to create a united Europe. Secretary Dulles was a
                    very strong advocate of that. He certainly was in every way a main supporter in
                    the United States of achieving this goal. We did an incredible amount behind the
                    scenes to try to grease the skids, and oil the wheels, and whatever else you had
                    to do to bring this about. We were active behind the scenes movers of this
                    activity. And we did it in part, and maybe in equal part, because we thought it
                    was necessary to rebuild the world economy in a dynamic expanding way to benefit
                    our own economy, and which would also would have a spin-off for the Third World
                    which we were concerned about. A way of stimulating the entire world economy at
                    a time that you had the Soviet Union, and China, sequestered over on the side,
                    largely at their own initiative. And at the same time it was a way of making
                    Western Europe resistant to the appeals of Eastern European Communists.</p>
                <p>In the end I believe that was one of the most creative and certainly the most
                    successful of all of the policies that this country has pursued in this century.
                    Our support for European unification, and even before that, for the rebuilding
                    of Europe as a dynamic, open, competitive, democratic society, was in the end, I
                    think, the thing that destroyed Communism. Because as the Communists looked
                    across the Iron Curtain and saw these Western European democracies which were,
                    and are, in all respects, as democratic as any country can be that we know in
                    our day. They had achieved standards of living which were still the theoretical
                    (though elusive and distant) objective of Communist societies throughout the
                    rest of the world. They had achieved their prosperity without sacrificing
                    individual freedoms. They had preserved individual dignity. They had improved
                    the standard of living. They had improved the quality of life for their citizens
                    to an extent that left the Soviet world completely in the dust. And in the
                    latter years of the 1980s, of course, this contrast between the incredible
                    prosperity of a democratic Western Europe, and an increasingly impoverished,
                    repressive and bureaucratized East, is what drove the East to its collapse. It
                    was the example of successful mixed economy and democratic government.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>All that, after all, was the result of the thinking of the post-war generation
                    which analyzed why the First and Second World Wars had occurred, and what was
                    needed to rebuild a world economy along idealistic lines. That concept of what
                    the world should be has come to fruition in our period. But we now find
                    ourselves without the kind of intellectual leadership, or intellectual
                    foresight, about what happens next. The great promise of the post-war planners
                    and thinkers has been realized and that cycle has come to an end. The new cycle
                    now beginning is in many ways much more difficult to deal with, largely because
                    there's a lack of intellectual preparation for what you do next. Anyway, that
                    was the way it appeared at the time when I got involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Still, but moving up, a youngish man dealing with this
                        from the United States, you were talking to other people and all from the
                        Western European powers, how did you see, again at the time, representatives
                        of other Western European countries feel about the role of the United
                        States? I mean, here we were sort of an upstart country over there, and
                        there was a term coca cola colonization. But on the ground how did American
                        representatives, and these Western Europeans at the working level, feel
                        about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: Well, I think one has to say to begin that from my point of view, I was
                    working in a special community. Once I entered the world of European integration
                    which began in Luxembourg after my brain washing at the Bologna Center, until I
                    left the Foreign Service, I was pretty much involved with people who were
                    intellectually committed to the achievement of a united Europe as a major
                    benefit to the United States. Their views inevitably were somewhat different
                    from those of the traditional state, or government, leadership. They were the
                    people who had moved into this particular aspect of their government's foreign
                    affairs because they were committed to it. So that's one thing to be said.</p>
                <p>The other people I dealt with were just ordinary, non- government people, on a
                    private basis. The reservoir of goodwill towards the United States that I found
                    in Western Europe, and all my experience after all was in Western Europe, was
                    absolutely astonishing. The people whom I have known in the United Kingdom,
                    France, Italy, the Benelux countries, Germany, showed tremendous admiration for
                    what the United States did in the First and Second World Wars, and what it did
                    afterwards. That doesn't mean that there wasn't plenty of criticism, but the
                    basic goodwill towards the United States was and, although it is somewhat
                    fading, still is a very powerful factor in our relations with these people. Now,
                    there's lots of criticism of specific US government policies. But there is a
                    distinction between the criticism that foreigners have of a specific government
                    policy, whether it was the execution of the Rosenbergs, or our intervention in
                    Guatemala, or our intervention in Panama, or various of the other of our
                    post-war adventures, or the criticism of a given president. Those things are at
                    one level. But the basic approval, and admiration, for our society that
                    underpins all of our relations with Europe, is at another level. This is a vast
                    reservoir which one can always draw upon if one has the wit to do it, the
                    understanding that it's there, and if one remains consistent with our own
                    ideals.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>So while there were lots of complaints about coca cola colonization, and while I
                    was involved in the chicken war in which the European communities tried to keep
                    out exports of Arkansas chickens, basically those were superficial matters. They
                    never affected the fundamental stability of our relationship because of our
                    agreement upon the real things that counted, the commitment to democratic
                    government, the commitment to a mixed economy, a commitment to an expanded and
                    reciprocal world trade, and a great commitment to human civil rights. So, yes,
                    lots of criticism but all that stuff is sort of the day-to-day up-and-down that
                    comes and goes with changing administrations. But did not affect the rock solid
                    foundation of our good relations with all of the European countries. That would
                    be my answer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Luxembourg, you were there from '61 to '63, what were
                        your responsibilities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: I had three responsibilities. One, I covered the steel industry and a
                    colleague covered coal for the entire European Coal and Steel Community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the core of the entire European integration, coal
                        and steel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: At the beginning. It all began with the concept of merging the coal and
                    steel markets so France and Germany would not feel that they each had to own
                    these resources. After this supra-national structure was created, the member
                    states went on to broaden the coverage by adding nuclear energy, and then the
                    European common market, and that all became the European Communities later
                    on.</p>
                <p>Well, steel is pretty interesting. The American steel industry was already having
                    problems. I was fascinated by the problem. I went around and visited steel
                    mills, I crawled around blast furnaces and met all kinds of people and talked to
                    their experts. Anyway, it became very clear to me after a little while that we
                    weren't going to be able to compete with the Europeans because they were making
                    enormous investments in new steel making capability. They were making oxygen
                    steel, and we hadn't even started. The Austrians were making oxygen steel, and
                    some of the others were, too. They were beginning work on continuous casting,
                    they were building brand new rolling mills that were very effective, a lot of
                    the equipment bought in the United States, of course, but a lot of it also
                    manufactured in Europe.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>So I went back to the States on home leave about that time, and the Department,
                    which has good arrangements for returning people, made it possible for me to go
                    visit Bethlehem Steel. I thought, the thing for me to do since I'd seen all
                    these European steel mills, was to see what my fellow countrymen were doing.
                    Well, that shook me up pretty badly. I went to Bethlehem where they'd been
                    manufacturing steel since the 1800s, and some vice president put a hard hat on
                    me, and we went off to visit the steel mills. Well, my family had been involved
                    at the labor level with the steel mills, I guess forever, and so I had an
                    impression of a great steel company even if it was not loved by its employees.
                    Bethlehem Steel was a big name when I was a kid. I got there and they took me
                    around. I was absolutely appalled at what I saw. They had a mill where they were
                    forging castings as the steel came out of the soaking pits. But the equipment
                    they were using had been installed at the time of the First World War! There it
                    was. They were still using the same stuff. My guide proudly pointed this out to
                    me, “Boy, she works like a charm. We installed her in 1917,” or something like
                    that. In fact, all of the equipment that I saw, as I went through the Bethlehem
                    plant, was old. It couldn't hold a candle to what the Europeans were doing.
                    Well, you draw some conclusions from that.</p>
                <p>Then the other thing that I worked on in Luxembourg was the European Court of
                    Justice. And that had me very excited because the Europeans had set up a court
                    modeled on our Supreme Court. The idea was that it would review legislation of
                    the Community institutions, their regulations, that is, as well as legislation
                    of the member states to see whether that legislation was consonant with the
                    Treaty. The Treaty overrode any national legislation. I went around and
                    interviewed the justices on this court.</p>
                <p>At the time the Chief Justice was a Dutchman with whom I had a wonderful meeting.
                    I had always been moved by the dignity and majesty of our own constitutional
                    law. I wanted to see how their philosophy related to our experience in
                    establishing the authority of the Supreme Court to determine the
                    constitutionality of ordinary law. I was delighted to discover that they knew
                    all about American constitutional history. They knew about Marbury versus
                    Madison. And they were very consciously shaping their rulings to try and create
                    precedents which would give their European Court of Justice, and which would
                    give the European Communities, the kinds of constitutional review which our
                    Supreme Court has had in the United States. Well, it was one of the most
                    interesting experiences I had, and I spent a lot of time documenting, reviewing,
                    and reporting on it.</p>
                <p>The other thing I did...well, I did some work on European transport policy, which
                    I also felt was very fascinating.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>But then my other responsibility was to go as an observer to the European
                    Parliament, which met in Strasbourg. The Communities, like all political
                    institutions, had to divide up the benefits and the rewards, and the French
                    didn't have any of its institutions on their soil, anything. The Belgians had
                    the offices of European Commission, and the Luxembourgers had the Coal and Steel
                    Community. The French wanted something so they got the Parliament. It met in
                    Strasbourg, impractical, but close to Luxembourg. So the US Mission to the
                    European Communities in Brussels which supervised the office in Luxembourg said,
                    “Okay, Fina, you go down and be our reporter and cover the Parliament.” I was
                    incredibly lucky. It was a wonderful job, because the Parliament was dealing
                    with all of the issues of the Communities, all across the board: nuclear energy,
                    market questions, coal and steel, political problems. And the members of the
                    European Parliament were politicians from all of the parties, except the
                    Communist as I recall, from all the Community states.</p>
                <p>I had a wonderful time. I went around and met these people, I interviewed them, I
                    wrote reports on the issues and proceedings, and telephoned the reports up to
                    Brussels to be used there and cabled to Washington. It was a lot of fun for me,
                    and apparently it was useful for my bosses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the name of the mission in Brussels?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: The Mission to the Communities was called USEC. And when I arrived, the
                    Ambassador was W. Walton Butterworth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Walton Butterworth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: W. Walton Butterworth. Although I only knew him from afar (Luxembourg!) he
                    was a very impressive man, with a wonderful knowledge of the subject, a
                    professional diplomatist, of whom the United States could be proud. He and his
                    wife were regal figures but very considerate of staff and very kind to my wife
                    and myself.</p>
                <p>Eventually I was summoned to move to Brussels, which was where the main mission
                    was located. I moved there in 1963 to become assistant to Jack Myerson, the very
                    astute and experienced Political Officer, a career Foreign Service Officer. Jack
                    was very knowledgeable about trade problems as well as about US-European affairs
                    and enjoyed the full confidence of both Butterworth and John Tuthill who
                    succeeded him as Ambassador just as I arrived in Brussels.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Tuthill, another career officer, had formerly headed our mission to the OECD, and
                    had made some of the major changes in the OECD—in fact, changed the OEEC to the
                    OECD. Like Butterworth, he seemed to be at the peak of his powers and authority
                    during the heroic phase of the development of the European Communities.</p>
                <p>In Brussels I had three main jobs—four main jobs. I was chief of protocol. That
                    was kind of a funny experience, I enjoyed it very much at the time, and it
                    suddenly came into its own when President Kennedy was murdered, and then I
                    actually worked hard. I learned that questions of protocol are genuinely
                    important not only to diplomats but in daily living as well.</p>
                <p>More demanding of my time and stimulating, was that I served as speech writer for
                    an Ambassador who had a lot to say and wanted it said well. Additionally, I
                    followed political questions with the Commission, that's the executive body of
                    the European communities. Political questions in the sense of, what the European
                    communities were doing in the big political picture, what their policy
                    objectives were, or what they were going to do. While my boss, Jack Myerson, was
                    the overall political advisor to the Ambassador, he was especially focused on
                    trade policy which, of course, was the center of our relations with the
                    Communities. This was especially true during the Kennedy Round of GATT
                    negotiations.</p>
                <p>I tried to know people throughout the three Communities, the Parliament and the
                    related bodies just as a good journalist would. They were a stimulating group of
                    people, almost all men, excited about creating a new world. These were heady
                    times. Perhaps my most useful and rewarding relationship was with Emil Noel, who
                    was then the Secretary General of the European Communities, a French prot�g� of
                    Guy Mollet. Noel was one of the most impressive, able, civil servants I have
                    ever met anywhere, and we had a very good relationship. And I must say I
                    benefitted enormously from my working with him.</p>
                <p>So that was '63 to '65, and working for Jack Tuthill was just a continuous
                    education. He was a very stimulating man who gave me lots of opportunities, gave
                    everyone an opportunity, was appreciative and a good critic. I have been a great
                    admirer and warm friend of his ever since. He was one of our great ambassadors
                    as far I'm concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, as you were there, I'm talking about you and the
                        American delegation look at this, view the major countries as far as their
                        cooperation? I mean were there some that gave annoyance all the time as far
                        as where we felt things should be going? I'm thinking obviously of France,
                        Germany, and Great Britain, particularly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: This was the period before the British had been admitted to the Communities
                    and the issue of their admittance was a central political issue between the
                    French (General De Gaulle) and the others.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they were a factor all the time, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: They were always the factor. They were always just over the horizon. We
                    wanted the British in the Communities, and we made no bones about it. The French
                    wanted them out, and made no bones about it, and they had a vote. The British
                    sometimes wanted to be in, and sometimes wanted to be out. While I was in
                    Brussels, we were still supporters of the concept of European unification. I
                    might say that ended with the Nixon administration, but that's down the line. At
                    this point we were committed to doing everything we could to bring about
                    European unification, behind the scenes, before the scenes, while protecting our
                    immediate political and commercial interests. Well, the French, the French
                    Government, were always difficult from our point of view. French officers, who
                    were seconded to the European communities, or who were direct employees of the
                    European communities, were a different kettle of fish. the French had, and may
                    still have, the most able, best prepared, cadre of civil servants of any of the
                    European countries, as far as I could see, very possibly including the United
                    States. French civil servants and diplomats were of the first water, well
                    educated, sophisticated, with a great sense of the state, which I think is
                    something that often is lacking in American diplomats, and lamentably, in
                    American presidents, but not so in the case of French civil servants.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Excuse me, when you say “a sense of state”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: I mean a sense of the responsibility of the individual for the collectivity
                    of the state, not as seen from the point of view of one political party or
                    another, but the state as the collectivity of Frenchmen, or Americans, which has
                    a stature that overarches the individual political parties, and the political
                    institutions. A sense that one has a loyalty to the community that one
                    represents, and that requires comportment of a certain dignity. The state is
                    important. It has not only a juridical existence, but it has a philosophical and
                    ideological existence as well which you, as a statesman, or as a politician, to
                    some degree represent. And in doing that, you carry some of the historical
                    burden of the state, and your actions are informed by a recognition of the past
                    of that community. It means the sense that you represent something more than
                    this morning's cable that you've gotten from Paris about what you're supposed to
                    do. And that you're invested with a certain dignity because you represent a
                    historical community tradition. That's what I'm talking about.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the French have that, or at least the ones with whom I dealt, had that to
                    a degree that practically no one else did, except, perhaps, the British. So they
                    were very difficult, very effective people if you were in conflict, as was the
                    case when they were opposing the admission of the British. They were very
                    effective. On the other hand their people in the Commission were very effective
                    in carrying out the goals of the Commission. So the French, and France, are two
                    different things, and sometimes they were our best friends, and sometimes they
                    were the people we most regretted.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>The Germans, I think, were almost uniformly the good guys. They were very much in
                    favor of European unification without protectionism. They supported the
                    enlargement of the community. They wanted it to work. They made sacrifices for
                    it to work. A lot of their people were absolutely first rate, not quite of the
                    glittering skill, I would say, of the French but very impressive.</p>
                <p>The Italians were totally committed to the success of the European community.
                    They were committed on ideological and political grounds. They believed in a
                    united Europe. There's a long tradition of Europeanism in Italy that goes back
                    to the 1800s. Carlo Sforza, the first post-war Italian Foreign Minister, had
                    been a great advocate of European unification. So they had the political will,
                    and this includes the Catholics of course, who have a vision of a Catholic
                    Europe. They also saw it as economically advantageous to Italy, and the
                    Community has given the Italian economy a shot in the arm, and has helped to
                    bring it to the very high level of efficiency and prosperity that it knows
                    today.</p>
                <p>But in terms of the personnel with whom I dealt with at the time, I'm sorry to
                    say, they were poorly represented. Italians don't really want to leave Italy,
                    and Italian politicians especially don't want to leave the home playing field
                    where all the plums and all the careers are made. No one would dream of leaving
                    Rome, which is where political intrigue boils from morning till morning. You
                    know if you turn your back, you've had it. So you could never get a political
                    figure of any significance to go to the European Community institutions. Not
                    even as a reward for after you've been thrown out of something, could you get
                    any Italian politician...a guy with political savvy, and skills, to come up
                    there. Their best representatives were their top career diplomats like Prince
                    Colonna. Otherwise, there were a lot of second string people. When it came to
                    the recruitment of civil servants, the Italians really don't want to leave home.
                    It's a much too nice place to be, so it was difficult to employ people even at
                    the secretarial, or the middle levels, as well. That isn't to say there weren't
                    some good ones, there were. But it was a genuine problem.</p>
                <p>So when you attended a meeting of the Council of Ministers, which I did all the
                    time as an observer, you'd see the French delegation come in and there would be
                    Couve de Murville, the French Foreign Minister, big, handsome, striding into the
                    room followed by a series of experts with briefcases, each one more brilliant
                    than the predecessor. And eventually the Italian ambassador would arrive because
                    the Minister couldn't make it, the plane broke down, or he couldn't come. So the
                    Italian ambassador would arrive, and he'd come with somebody from the Ministry
                    of Foreign Affairs.</p>
                <p>And that was sort of the way it ran. The French fielded a brilliant team on every
                    occasion, at every level. And I'm afraid that the people who brought up the rear
                    were the Italians who always came...they were charming, and they knew what they
                    wanted lots of times, but they didn't pack the clout that their vote would have
                    given them.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>The Germans were in between. They were the real heavyweights. They got a lot of
                    the things they wanted, but they weren't quite at the level of the French.</p>
                <p>The Belgians, I think, were pretty good although they knew that they were a small
                    power. The Dutch were very strongly committed to European integration, they did
                    a good job. They would, I suppose, rank close to the French in terms of their
                    competence, and their commitment, but they weren't a great power. That makes a
                    difference in the kind of clout you have.</p>

                        George Ball being a colleague and a disciple of Jean Monnet, was almost too
                        pro-European? I mean, did you feel sometimes that maybe the United States
                        was selling out the store, or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: Not in our team. We were all Ball supporters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ball-ites.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: Ball-ites. We thought he was great. We thought that what he was doing, and
                    what we were trying to do, was profoundly in the interest of the United States.
                    That it was the enlightened thing to do for the interests of our country,
                    bearing in mind the events of the First World War, the Great Depression of which
                    we were all very conscious. We were of an age where most of us had grown up
                    during the Depression and the Second World War which most of us had seen at
                    closer hand than the First World War. So that we thought that what we were doing
                    was really the right thing, and we were absolutely delighted. I don't remember
                    ever hearing any criticism from our group about George Ball although there was
                    plenty of criticism in the US about our support for European integration on the
                    grounds that it would be contrary to our economic and political interests.</p>

                <p>Now, there were other people, other parts of the government, that felt
                    differently. But we fought them with serried ranks, and it was a time when Mr.
                    Ball's writ ran far. And when we ran into problems, it was Mr. Ball who had the
                    clout to cut through.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is one question that I didn't cover in our last time
                        when you were in Brussels working with the European community. How did you
                        and the others view Japan at that time, '63 to '65?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: I don't think that Japan figured very largely in our thinking. Japan was a
                    member of COCOM, and played a pretty minor role in that, and, of course, wasn't
                    a member of NATO. The Japanese were present in Brussels, but they weren't really
                    significant players. It wasn't until I got into the White House in 1971 that I
                    suddenly became aware of Japan in a big way.</p>

                <p>FINA: I went back to be the Officer-in-Charge of European Integration Affairs.
                    That was an office that covered European communities, the Western European
                    union, and EFTA, as well as the...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: EFTA being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: EFTA was the European Free Trade Area which had been the British-backed
                    counterweight to the continental European unification of the European
                    Communities, the Common Market. But EFTA by that time had pretty much faded out
                    and had lost any real future so that my job boiled down to support for the
                    Mission in Brussels, our Mission to the European Communities - that meant the
                    Coal and Steel Community, the European Common Market and EURATOM, which during
                    my period then became the European Communities.</p>
                <p>Another aspect of that job was support of the economic aspect of the NATO
                    Assembly. That was something every now and then, but the heart of the job, and
                    the thing that was the most interesting for me was our support for the movement
                    toward European political unification. And that was what really drove our
                    activity. We saw economic integration in Europe as a stimulus to the world
                    economy, and therefore to our own economy, and strengthening the long-term
                    vitality of the world economy, and of our own economy. But we also saw it as the
                    way of bringing about European political unity which we thought would create a
                    major pole of stability with which the United States could collaborate on more
                    or less equal terms, particularly in view of the continued power of the Soviet
                    Union and its allies. So we saw the creation of this other pole as a very
                    important objective. And I think that was really the consideration that drove
                    everything we did.</p>

                        role of Germany? I mean, the whole idea of this European integration was
                        really to embrace Germany, in a way. Having been dragged into two world wars
                        over the German problem, was there ever any question about say, “Well, 20-30
                        years from now ___ Germany?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: Concern about Germany was always in the back of one's mind. Those of us who
                    had been involved, or fought in the Second World War, obviously had a lot of
                    sensitivity to what was happening in Germany. Our view, however, was that by
                    involving Germany deeply, and creating a single state in Europe, or as near to a
                    single state as you could, you diminished the chances of a rogue Germany being
                    able to create new problems. The French had understood that during the war.
                    Immediately after the war they had taken the initiative in trying to deal with
                    this issue in a very creative way by putting behind them the animosities, the
                    hostilities of the war of 1870, the war of 1914, and that really set the tone
                    for what we were doing. Our whole idea was to work with the Germans who wanted
                    to create a united Europe in which Germany would be so firmly imbedded that the
                    kind of aberration of a Nazi movement, or a recrudescence of that sort of thing,
                    would be minimal. That was something very much in our minds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the role of France? This was high de Gaulle,
                        wasn't it? I was interviewing somebody recently who served in France and
                        what Mac___ was saying it sounds like being in a hostile country. It was the
                        early ''60s, you know, from Couve de Murville on down. I mean really de
                        Gaulle turned more and more anti- American. How did you find this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: We had, I suppose, what you'd call a love-hate relationship with the
                    French. Interestingly, it was the French who were the strongest people working
                    for European integration, and they were also the strongest people who were
                    obstructing it. That was part of the wonderful anomaly of that situation. The
                    civil servants in Brussels, and in Luxembourg, who were driving the whole
                    internal movement of the European communities, were the French. They were the
                    most confident, the most imaginative, the most determined, and in many ways the
                    most eloquent advocates of European integration. At the same time just a little
                    to the south in Paris, you had General de Gaulle, one of the most eloquent,
                    persuasive people in the post-war world, who had absolutely no intention of
                    allowing France to be submerged in this melange, this mixed breed that he saw
                    coming out. And it was always a matter of puzzlement to me, and I guess to
                    others who followed this situation closely, that General de Gaulle didn't take
                    the lead in European unification. Had he done so, France would have dominated
                    the new Europe in a way that no other state could. Frenchmen, and people who
                    were loyal to French thinking, occupied the key positions of the entire
                    community structure. They were the de facto leaders of what was going on. If
                    General de Gaulle had picked up the banner and led, he could have become the
                    Father of Europe. Jean Monnet, who was the real father of Europe, wasn't able to
                    do because he didn't have the political profile, he wasn't that up front.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>But de Gaulle refused to do that. He had his own vision of the world, and of
                    France's role, and consequently he held things back for many years. He balked
                    British membership in the Communities, and that was a very exciting tense time
                    when the United States was still pitted against de Gaulle, at least in the early
                    period.</p>
                <p>After Henry Kissinger became Secretary of State, or even when he became National
                    Security Adviser for President Nixon, our position began to change very
                    significantly. Kissinger was no supporter of European integration. He was in
                    fact an admirer of General de Gaulle. And that began to create a lot of problems
                    for those of us who were committed to European unification. It created personal
                    career problems for me in particular. Because when Kissinger began to give the
                    signal that we were no longer to support European unification, we were to become
                    passive. Whereas before during the Ball period, during the Johnson
                    Administration, during the Kennedy Administration, we had been active. We had
                    been behind the scenes. We'd been fixing things, pushing things, driving things,
                    with a vision of achieving a united Europe because that was in the interest of
                    the United States. Henry Kissinger basically first put us in neutral, saying,
                    “No, we're not going to do this anymore.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This had been probably...Nixon came in '69.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: Well, it was even earlier than that. Didn't Nixon come in '68, something
                    like that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Johnson didn't run in the election of '68, and Nixon
                        beat Humphrey, so he would have come in '69.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: It was the very beginning of the Nixon period when among the earliest
                    things that he did was to begin to give the signal that we were to stop
                    support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling, the rationale for that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>FINA: I'm not sure that I understand, or remember, Kissinger's rationale. What I
                    remember are the results of his policy which was, to stop support for European
                    integration. And that rippled out through everything we did, whether it was in
                    the trade negotiations, whether it was NATO, or political negotiations. He was
                    an admirer of General de Gaulle's. He said he was an admirer of General de
                    Gaulle's, and that meant that down at the peasant level where I was, it became
                    increasingly difficult to continue the policies of support for European
                    integration which I thought, and continue to think, were profoundly in the
                    interest of the United States. That created conflict for me, and for others. My
                    boss, Bob Schaetzel was replaced. He had been Deputy Assistant Secretary of
                    State for Atlantic Affairs, and then he went to Brussels as Ambassador. Now, the
                    new team simply was not willing to continue the policies that the Ball group had
                    fostered in the past.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to more of the Johnson period with Ball, was
                        the feeling that with de Gaulle you sort of said, “Okay, he's there, but he
                        is a temporary phenomenon.” Obviously the French bureaucracy was already
                        more or less in line to this integration thing. Was it the feeling, “We can
                        outlast de Gaulle.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: I don't remember a feeling like that. We were all, I think, aware of the
                    mortality issue but the question was whether Jean Monnet would outlive Charles
                    de Gaulle. We had the recollection of the long-lived German chancellor. We had
                    Adenauer, who had lasted until he was a very elderly man. Chiang Kai-shek was
                    still on the scene and so was Franco. So I don't think that anyone was counting
                    on General de Gaulle departing for the Elysian Fields, no. We figured it was a
                    day-to-day issue. I wouldn't say that the French bureaucracy in France was sold
                    on the positions of the French who had gone to Brussels. I don't know enough
                    about them. I imagine they were pretty loyal to the boss.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FINA: It could very well be. My period in France, I found the French to be
                    charming, delightful, amusing, but I wasn't in conflict with their
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's always the official, and the personal. As you were
                        working in EUR, John Leddy was the head of that, was he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: He was the Assistant Secretary for European Affairs, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>FINA: Leddy was primarily an economist, an international economist. He was also
                    very much interested in the political side, and he was a supporter of European
                    unification. But I never felt that he was particularly assertive in his
                    position. His deputy for Atlantic Affairs at that time was Bob Schaetzel who was
                    very much of an operator, very creative, imaginative, and was the person to whom
                    I was most attached, and felt most loyal. George Springsteen came down from
                    Ball's office where he had been Ball's special assistant and succeeded Schaetzel
                    when he went to Brussels.</p>
                <p>I disliked him and he reciprocated. He had always been a hatchet man for Ball,
                    and he did what he was told to do. But when he became Deputy Assistant Secretary
                    for Atlantic Affairs, he was rather more enthusiastic about abandoning our
                    support for European unification than it seemed to me that he should have been.
                    And we found ourselves in conflict almost from day one. And that made me very
                    interested in getting out of EUR, which I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: I went to the National War College for a year. That was a good experience,
                    I was very glad of that opportunity. I think EUR assigned me to that job both to
                    please the Deputy Assistant Secretary who wanted to get someone who was more
                    malleable in my job, and possibly out of sympathy for me, to let me escape from
                    a situation that I found increasingly disagreeable. I thought the War College
                    was very good. It was a period when we were in the midst of the Vietnam War, and
                    War College people were overwhelmingly favorable to what we were doing in
                    Vietnam. I really was very ignorant about it, and I didn't really want to get to
                    know more. I didn't know much about Southeast Asia, and I had no interest in
                    learning any more. But at the time I was pretty much convinced that what we were
                    doing was inescapable. I didn't think that we should have gotten into that war,
                    but I thought once we got into it, I didn't see how we could possibly get out
                    unless we carried it through. In retrospect I think that was probably a lousy
                    analysis of the situation. But at the time it seemed to me the right thing to
                    do. The War College gave me an opportunity to travel to the Far East, and to
                    think about some other things, and to meet a lot of military people who were
                    going to have senior responsibilities in the military service. That was a very
                    good experience.</p>

                <p>FINA: I was in the class of '69, I forget when graduation was, I suppose it was
                    in the spring or summer of '69, and therefore I was looking for a job. I guess
                    it was Art Hartman, who was then the Special Assistant to the Under Secretary of
                    State, put me on to a possibility in the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency,
                    ACDA. They were looking for a new Staff Director, whatever you want to call him,
                    to the General Advisory Committee which was a committee of distinguished
                    citizens who were supposed to advise the President and the Director of the Arms
                    Control Agency on arms control negotiations.</p>
                <p>John McCloy had just been named chairman of the committee. Nixon had appointed a
                    new committee. It included Bill Casey, and Bill Scranton, Peter Peterson, Jack
                    Ruina of MIT, about a dozen absolutely first rate men in this country. And at
                    the time I didn't know who they were, but I knew that McCloy was looking for a
                    staff director. I thought that would be a great opportunity becauseworking for
                    McCloy would be terrific since he was a very influential man, who had had a
                    major role in our foreign policy toward Europe. When he interviewed me, I didn't
                    know what he was looking for, but I told him what I believed in. I didn't really
                    know much about McCloy at the time. I didn't know where he stood on Monnet, or
                    on European unification. I knew that he had been very important in German
                    affairs. I told him pretty much what I've told you about my views about the
                    importance of European unification to the United States, and how I thought that
                    arms control and our relationship with the Soviet Union related to all that. And
                    that seemed to satisfy him, and I got the job.</p>
                <p>The job I got was a non-job. We had no offices. We had nothing. So I created the
                    position, set up the system. I thought the way to do this was to have an agenda
                    of issues that Committee should advise the President about. We were then in the
                    SALT 1 negotiations. The central question was whether we should agree with the
                    Soviet Union to outlaw anti-ballistic missiles. We had long been playing with
                    that idea and now we were negotiating to see whether we could reach a
                    satisfactory agreement.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>So I set up a series of hearings to which we brought the most eminent people in
                    the United States Government, and outside the government. I had Andre Fontaine,
                    who was then the foreign editor of Le Monde, and I had various Europeans, Pierre
                    ___ perhaps, and other people whom I had known who I thought would bring a world
                    picture, and creative ideas to the question. We set up meetings in the
                    Operations Center, or some conference rooms on the 7th floor of State, I got a
                    Department stenographer to make a verbatim record. I set up a big hollow square
                    table which I thought very important to the process. I provided the witnesses
                    with detailed questions in advance—what we wanted them to discuss. So when we
                    got a witness, usually there were maybe three or four it seems to me for a
                    session, the witness would focus on the tough questions without our committee
                    members having had to study up in advance to know what to ask. They were exposed
                    to the questions and the answers. These were just one day sessions because it
                    was very hard to get these men together. And the only way you could get them to
                    come, was if it were interesting. I realized it had to be something that they
                    thought was worthwhile, that was stimulating to them, and in the right kind of
                    an environment. And that was one reason I wanted to go for witnesses who would
                    really be provocative, and that we tried to ask really provocative and searching
                    questions. They fell into two general categories: (1) the professional experts
                    and officials with access to the highly classified information about Soviet and
                    our weapons and policies and (2) non-government connected people who were
                    authoritative about world opinion, Soviet policies, or general arms control
                    policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to get a Soviet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: You mean from the Soviet Union?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: No. That might very well have run into various political problems within
                    the Administration. I was happy enough getting people with independent opinions
                    about what we were doing from around the non-communist world. And then, of
                    course, this was all done at an exceedingly high security classification which
                    created a special problem.</p>
                <p>To help create the right environment, we had a buffet in the meeting room so
                    there was never a break for a meal. People got up and got something and went
                    back to the table. We went right on to get as much done as possible during our
                    one day meeting (there were held about monthly).</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>I based a lot of my information on continuing conversations with people in ACDA
                    and other parts of the government to keep myself informed about what the issues
                    were, and what we ought to be exploring. Suffice it to say that periodically we
                    would come up with a hunk of advice to the President. The most important one of
                    the pieces of advice was a recommendation that the SALT treaty be approved. The
                    Committee was all in favor, and unanimously, I might say, and this included Bill
                    Casey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was head of the Central Intelligence Agency.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: He later became head of Central Intelligence. At this time he was still
                    just a rich right wing lawyer in New York, who had signed at least one full page
                    ad in the New York Times, condemning the SALT negotiations. But once he got into
                    the Committee, he finally joined a unanimous recommendation that the SALT treaty
                    be approved, and that we abandon our independent initiative in the anti-
                    ballistic missile field. I was, and remain, pretty pleased that I was able to
                    help this group of very wise men to come to this conclusion.</p>
                <p>This was something to which the Department of Defense at the lower level was
                    completely opposed. Under Secretary of Defense Packard, I must say, who was
                    always the spokesman for Defense during this period, was very good. So were the
                    Joint Chiefs. But at lower levels there was an awful lot of opposition, and
                    people in DEA were constantly seeing, in my view, mirages about what the
                    Russians could, and would, be doing.</p>
                <p>The most important recommendation that we ever made was against MIRVing, the
                    multiple independently targeted missile—a warhead. It was a period before we had
                    made the final decision to deploy MIRVed weapons to our nuclear submarines. We
                    had invented this system of multiple warheads. It was a quantum leap forward in
                    the destructive capability of the attacker. And it increased your defensive
                    possibilities because any attacker would have to eliminate many more of your
                    silos before he could eliminate your counter-strike capability. At that time we
                    had the monopoly on this technology and it was pretty clear that when we MIRVed,
                    we would have a significant advantage compared to the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>Well, we held hearings on the strategic implications of MIRV, and I got all sorts
                    of people in there to debate the issue. I think we gave it a very fair shake.
                    The conclusion was that we recommended against proceeding with MIRVing on the
                    grounds that it would only be a temporary advantage. The Soviet Union would
                    almost immediately catch up with us. We would simply be back to a stalemate
                    situation. It would be better to get an agreement with the Soviet Union not to
                    MIRV. The question was, could that be done? Well, from the conversations I had
                    with various people in the SALT delegation who were talking to the Russians, I
                    became convinced that it was do-able. At any rate that we ought to make a
                    serious effort to get that kind of an agreement because it would be so
                    advantageous to us.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>The Committee accepted my draft paper (I prepared all of the draft
                    recommendations) which made this recommendation, approved it unanimously, and
                    McCloy was to deliver it. We sent it to Kissinger, and McCloy was to ask for a
                    meeting with the President to state the Committee's position. Well, Kissinger
                    could never find time for the President to meet with the Committee on this
                    issue, although it had met with him on a previous occasion. And Kissinger killed
                    the recommendation.</p>
                <p>One of the things that I concluded about McCloy during this period was that he
                    was really not prepared to take on the establishment. He was a wise man, he had
                    all the connections, he had had fantastic experiences from the First World War
                    until then, but basically he was not the kind of guy who was going to fight city
                    hall. And I think that is one of the things that led Douglas Dillon to be the
                    only member to resign from the committee during my assignment to it. I think he
                    dropped out because he concluded that we were not really going to take on
                    Kissinger and the Administration on a couple of the fundamental issues. And this
                    may very well have been one of them.</p>
                <p>McCloy's heart was in the right place, but he shared the deep skepticism that
                    everyone else had at the time of the Soviet Union, and I don't think he thought
                    there were chances of the kind of negotiating compromise that people in ACDA who
                    were negotiating with the Russians at the time thought they saw. He played a
                    rather passive role in all of this that disappointed me since he didn't go to
                    bat for what was really a very fundamental issue.</p>
                <p>And you may have noticed a few years later, maybe it was about six years ago,
                    Kissinger said publicly that he had made an error in having supported our
                    MIRVing. It was a great personal satisfaction to hear that come from him,
                    although it is the sort of satisfaction you have in private because very few
                    people knew that any one had opposed proceeding with MIRV deployment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the impression while you were charged with
                        organizing this thing, of Kissinger, and the National Security Advisor's
                        office? Kissinger was the National Security Advisor. What was his view
                        towards arms control disarmament?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>FINA: Well, I would say, my impression of Mr. Kissinger at the time was that he
                    was interested only in relatively limited arms control agreements with the
                    Soviet Union. That he wanted to keep all this in his own hands. There was no
                    real power shared, as far as I could see, on our negotiating position, or on
                    these questions, with anyone else. He certainly repeatedly humiliated the
                    Director of the Arms Control Agency, Gerry Smith, who was conducting the
                    negotiations in Helsinki, and wherever else they were at the time. I remember
                    particularly when we were sending things up to the National Security Council,
                    Kissinger was always very plain that no National Security Council deliberation
                    was ever to conclude with a recommendation. National Security Council papers all
                    ended with the transmittal of the discussion, and the arguments to the
                    President, but that really meant to Mr. Kissinger and the decisions were then
                    all made in a much more restricted group. He was never going to let the National
                    Security Council be in a position, I won't say dictating, but deciding things
                    which the President would then have to overrule, or abide by.</p>
                <p>And on this issue of MIRV, which was a very fundamental one, I thought it was
                    just very clear that he had absolutely no interest in trying to reach an
                    agreement. I thought that was pretty ignorant. And in as much as he had
                    abandoned our support for European integration which was, to my way of thinking,
                    a very major way of dealing with the Soviet bloc, and was not willing to
                    negotiate with them in a meaningful way here, I didn't have a very high opinion
                    of this National Security Advisor. On the other hand, I was by no means privy to
                    Kissinger's private discussions or thinking so I can speak authoritatively only
                    about the Committee and my work with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the role of the Defense Department? You mentioned
                        unhappiness at the technical level, and these are the guys who wanted to get
                        their stuff out there and use it. I mean it was fair enough at the top, but
                        what was your impression of the role that Defense was playing in the game of
                        disarmament, or at least down-sizing the military side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: I thought that Packard was always...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was Assistant Secretary...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: He may have been Deputy Secretary of Defense. I thought he was always very
                    much interested in reaching arms control agreements with the Soviet Union, even
                    though we were in a period of continual competition with them. I think he saw
                    the advantage as a closing off areas where there was very little to gain from
                    our point of view in competing. And one of them, of course, was the area
                    anti-ballistic missiles.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>The politics inside the Department of Defense, of course, are all weighted in the
                    direction of bigger, and better, and more. It's very hard to find anyone, from
                    my experience with the armed services, who isn't convinced that you need the
                    latest, the biggest, and the best, and after all, that's their profession. They
                    are not professional arms controllers. They believe in the Roman dictum of, if
                    you want peace, prepare for war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were involved in this arms control thing, particularly
                        you had to be looking at nuclear strategy. The question that always comes
                        up, and one looks at exchanges, one can play this game and say, “If we knock
                        out all but five percent of their population, we have 20 percent of our
                        population left, we win.” There must have the question about, it is not a
                        theoretical thing, it's almost impossible to win one of these things. Or did
                        you find yourself getting involved in these mathematical models which the
                        experts seem to enjoy so much? They're not really talking about what would
                        happen to society.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: As far as my work with the Arms Control Agency, and the General Advisory
                    Committee was concerned, I would say that was never really a serious issue. The
                    people at a senior level in Defense, and in State, and of course in CIA which
                    was, I might say among the more—if I may use the term—liberal forces involved in
                    all this, never believed that anyone could win after a nuclear exchange. I don't
                    think there was anybody of a sophisticated nature who thought that there was
                    going to be anyone who could walk away from a nuclear exchange. The best you
                    could say was, that we could demonstrate to the Soviet Union, and to other
                    people, that if they started something, we would be able to retaliate in such a
                    hideous way, that it really wasn't worth starting.</p>
                <p>Now, when you get to a lower level, when you got to the colonel level, or the
                    general level, that I found was a different kettle of fish. I've had a number of
                    very heated arguments with people at that level about whether you could win a
                    nuclear war. There were a lot of guys down there then, and for all I know now,
                    who are absolutely convinced that after the last exchange, we would have more
                    people staggering to their feet than they would and therefore we'd win. I found
                    that incredible but I must say it was a very widely shared view among people in
                    the military services, and a lot of the less sophisticated political people too.
                    I don't think that was the case, however, with the policy people who were really
                    close to the matter. There they saw it as a question of deterrence. And the
                    question was, how much do you need to deter? One school was, you've got to match
                    them missile for missile, or they won't be deterred. And the other school was, a
                    few hundred or a thousand missiles were enough to deter any rational person, and
                    the irrational one you weren't going to be able to deter even if you matched gun
                    barrel for gun barrel.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for what was happening on the other
                        side of the Hill, and in the Soviet Union? I mean, was there any input about
                        how they were thinking about things?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>FINA: To some degree, yes. One got some views from the negotiators who were
                    convinced that the people they were dealing with in many cases were interested
                    in finding a way to stop the escalation. At the time there were sort of two
                    schools in the United States. One was, let's find a way to stop the escalation
                    because it's hurting us, and it's hurting them. And the other school, and that
                    was the conservative, the right wing school, was, “We'll spend them into the
                    grave, let's compete with them, in the end they're going to go bankrupt.” “And
                    sure, it's going to cost us a lot of money, but we've got more to spend than
                    they do, and we're going to destroy the Soviet system because we're going to
                    bankrupt them.”</p>
                <p>In some respects those guys have been proven right, that that competition did
                    help to destroy the Soviet Union, although I think there are other things that
                    did it too. The question is whether it didn't destroy us at the same time. I
                    always thought that was one of the risks, that we would commit such a large part
                    of our resources, or capacity, to war making that we were increasingly
                    neglecting our internal economy—the problems of the cities, our racial problems
                    in this country. And that we were indebting ourselves to an extent that was
                    going to undercut our real strength. I thought that then, and it seems to me
                    that that has certainly turned out to be the case. I think it still remains to
                    be seen whether we have reached the bottom of the price that we're paying for
                    this attempt to outspend the Soviets. Certainly the tremendous national debt
                    that we've accumulated, the incredible interest charges we're paying, the
                    neglect of the cities, all the things that are the condemnation of the Reagan
                    and the Bush period, in my view, in their domestic policy, are outgrowths of
                    this policy of our competition with the Soviet Union at any price.</p>
                <p>Well, those were issues at the time of the General Advisory Committee, and that
                    was one reason that it seemed to me, and to others, that it was important to try
                    and find ways to slow things down. There was reason to believe that the Soviets
                    knew that this was a disastrous course for themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To sum up with this Advisory Committee, what happened? Did
                        it continue? I notice that you...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: Well, what happened was that after the recommendation on MIRVing, we then
                    went on to some other issues which I don't recall at the moment. But about that
                    time Peter Peterson, who was a successful businessman, a friend of Senator
                    Percy's, and a member of McCloy's General Advisory Committee, wanted a senior
                    government appointment. He knew George Shultz who had real power in the Nixon
                    Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was Secretary of Treasury at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>FINA: ...who at that time may have been special advisor to the President for
                    economic affairs, or something like that. Anyway, Shultz recommended Peterson to
                    be Under Secretary of State. There was a change of Under Secretaries at State at
                    that time, so Peterson wanted that job. I don't know how I got involved in it,
                    but I became his ally in trying to get the job. I was busy trying to find out
                    where things stood and we worked closely together. He failed to get that
                    appointment but then he had a chance of becoming Special Assistant to the
                    President for International Economic Affairs. Nixon decided, or maybe Kissinger
                    decided, who knows who decided, to create someone comparable to Kissinger to
                    deal with international economic affairs. And since Peterson had been very
                    active in international economics and in business and had the backing of Shultz,
                    he eventually got the job.</p>
                <p>He then asked me to help interview people for his staff and to outline how his
                    office would function. I got very much involved interviewing all sorts of people
                    to work in the White House before he came down. I saw this as an opportunity to
                    leave the General Advisory Committee, in which after all I'd had a stimulating
                    experience, but going to the White House looked even more interesting. And
                    Peterson was a very attractive guy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, I assume the Advisory Committee, something like
                        that, on that it really is sort of the beginning of the Nixon
                        administration, had shot its bolt pretty much, hadn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: Yes. There wasn't any major issue left at that time, it's true. We'd been
                    through these two very big things, the SALT agreement and MIRVing, and while
                    there were a lot of interesting things out there, they weren't of that level. So
                    I was ready to go on to something else, and the idea of ending up in the White
                    House, in career terms, looked great to me. And Peterson was a very imaginative
                    guy, and so he took me on as his assistant, or something—I forget what the title
                    was over in the White House. And I left McCloy, and moved into the White House
                    for an exceedingly brief period.</p>
                <p>That was one of the most turbulent periods of my life, for a variety of reasons.
                    One, the White House was very hostile to Foreign Service Officers, and to the
                    Department of State. It was the Nixon White House. It was filled with political
                    types who were very distrustful of career officers under the Department of State
                    as a hotbed of something bad. Consequently, sort of everywhere you turned you
                    found people who were making nasty remarks about the Department of State. And
                    while I'm pretty critical of the Department of State for being too conservative,
                    it's kind of funny being criticized for being too radical. Anyway, that was one
                    aspect.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>Another aspect was that Peter Peterson turned out to be, from my point of view,
                    an absolutely impossible guy to work for. He was totally disorganized. He'd
                    bring his briefcase into the office in the morning, or it was usually a small
                    suitcase, and he'd simply turn it upside down on his desk, and everything would
                    fall out. There would be a pile of papers, and books, all over hell, and he
                    never knew where anything was. Somehow or other, I was his only assistant at the
                    time, and I had to find out what had happened to that memo he had written to the
                    President, or where things were. I'm not very good at that myself, and I'm not
                    really very interested in being a glorified clerk. So I was busy trying to get
                    him a staff of secretaries, assistants, paper pushers, all the things that you
                    need in order to keep a high powered guy going.</p>
                <p>And at the same time we were deluged with letters from people who wanted jobs. It
                    was an experience for the uninitiated like myself to get these letters. “Dear
                    Pete, Congratulations on your appointment. The President certainly made a wise
                    decision. I remember well when you and I appeared on the panel at DuPluck
                    University to discuss so and so, and I thought your remarks then were as
                    incisive and brilliant as I found them to be since. I'm available at the present
                    time if in the event that you think that my collaboration would be of value. And
                    I include my 40 page resume.” Well, I had a file cabinet full of these things.
                    There were so many of them that I couldn't even answer them or acknowledge them.
                    And telephone calls from the usual assortment of climbers, of whom there are
                    many in every capital, and in every court. I'm sure Louis Quatorze was besieged
                    by these guys. But in Washington we have our own special brand. And all these
                    guys, whom I had known at one time or another in the past, suddenly appeared on
                    the phone and we were warm friends, and good old Tom, and he'd like to see
                    Peter, whom he had never met, of course. But tell Pete that I would...</p>
                <p>That was an interesting if somewhat depressing experience to see how that worked.
                    But I decided that what Peter needed were some really absolutely first rate
                    people around him, and I recommended that he take on as his staff director Dean
                    Hinton, who had been my boss at one time. Hinton was an absolutely superb mind,
                    a very competent professional, whom I thought would be wonderful. And at that
                    time he was maybe in Chile. I'm not sure. He was off in some post. Well, I sold
                    him to Pete, and he got him back up here, and they fortunately hit it off, and
                    Dean moved in. And I got various other people whom I thought were absolutely
                    first rate, and I think they were. But I rapidly discovered that I had recruited
                    myself out of a job. And I had recruited myself out of a job partly because I
                    don't think I was really up to the intellectual, and professional, requirements
                    of that job. You needed someone who was really more competent than I was in
                    dealing with these issues, and a guy like Dean Hinton could do it. He had the
                    skill, the experience, and the brains to do it, and I knew that I didn't.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>So, I was very uncomfortable in that position because I really had nothing to do.
                    Once I'd gotten these people in there, and gotten them on-line, I concluded the
                    best thing for me to do was to get out of here. I couldn't really—I had no
                    intention of trying to compete with Dean Hinton—and I couldn't stand Peter after
                    I got to know him a little better. So I asked for out. He was very nice and
                    said, “Name any job you want.” He was very gracious. But I realized there was
                    really no job in that situation that I would be able to fulfill with any sense
                    of satisfaction.</p>
                <p>And so, after a very short time, I can't have been there more than—February to
                    April. I went back to State to walk the halls.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Walking halls, I might add, is our term for being
                        essentially being without a job. I speak of someone who has “walked
                        halls.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: It is so devastating, and so...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Without a job, you're a non-person.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: That's right. All of us, it seems to me, who have made a career in the
                    Department of State, are there not because of the money, but because we've been
                    interested in the substance of wanting to do something. And when you discover
                    that there's nothing that anyone wants you to do, it's pretty hard on the
                    ego.</p>
                <p>Well, fortunately I got picked up, and again it was by Art Hartman, who put me in
                    touch with David Abshire, who at that time was the Assistant Secretary of State
                    for Congressional Relations, that was H. David was a stout Republican out of the
                    Georgetown Center for Strategic Studies which he had been running, and which he
                    had turned into quite a reputable, if conservative, foreign affairs
                    think-tank.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that's the center out of Georgetown.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: Yes, which he had pretty much created. He was a remarkable operator. I must
                    say David Abshire was among the most skillful lobbyists I have ever seen.
                    Certainly he was a model of how you should run the Bureau of Congressional
                    Relations. He was very good. I don't agree with his politics, and I don't think
                    he really understood much, if anything, about the substance. It seems to me he
                    was a graduate of either B.M.I., or West Point, he had a military education. He
                    didn't really know much about the things that interested me, or that I worked
                    on, namely, NATO, the European Communities, international trade policy, GATT and
                    so on. He didn't know much about them and he didn't really appear much to
                    care.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>But at any rate, he took me on, and my responsibility was the Ways and Means
                    Committee because it had the responsibility for the GATT negotiations for trade
                    policy. At that time Wilbur Mills was the legendary chairman, and he ran that
                    committee with a very tight hand. It was a very powerful committee. I also had
                    the responsibility for NATO questions, and for the European Communities. And
                    then we dreamed up various other things, about how to communicate for the
                    Congress. I was convinced that one of the things that was very useful to us, or
                    could be very useful, was communicating with the staff. You couldn't cover all
                    of the staff. There were too many hundreds of people up there. And you couldn't
                    get to the members all the time. Abshire, or a Deputy Assistant Secretary, or an
                    Ambassador could get to a member almost anytime, to a Senator, or a Congressman.
                    But the rest of us couldn't do that as easily, and you had to deal pretty much
                    with the professional staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, you were talking about developing relations with the
                        Congressional staffs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: Yes. One of the main problems is, how do you influence members of Congress?
                    And one of the things that we did was to create a series of briefings for staff
                    members. We figured staff members have more time; in many ways they're more
                    professional than the members themselves, they know more about the subject, and
                    so I set up a series of Dutch-treat luncheons down on the Hill. We got a dining
                    room, and everybody paid his own way to come, since State has no money, and
                    never had any money, to pay to invite staffers. And we would get a couple
                    hundred people in those things, and then we'd have a significant person from the
                    Department of State speak about this problem, or that. It was a way of getting
                    our point of view across to a lot of people who were influential with their
                    bosses. That was one thing we did.</p>
                <p>Another thing we did was to organize a series of morning breakfasts. I sort of
                    thought of myself, and still think of myself, as sort of a social arranger. But
                    I'd fix up breakfasts down there and get senior people from the Department, and
                    invite Senators or members of Congress, the key people we wanted to reach. We
                    might get 10 or 12 members for a breakfast, which is pretty good. Getting
                    members of Congress to sit still very long is very difficult because they're
                    under such tremendous pressure and they've got such an enormous amount of work
                    to do. But those breakfasts, which we generally did around 8:00 in the morning
                    in the Capitol, were, I thought, very successful. David Abshire hosted them
                    with, I think, consummate skill.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>I must say I came away from my—what was it a year, maybe two years up there, '71
                    to '73—with a very good impression of the Congress. I don't think that there
                    were many members whom I knew, or even knew of, whom you could not approach, and
                    from whom you could not get a fair hearing on an issue. If they weren't
                    committed for some special reason, whether they were Republicans or Democrats, I
                    always felt you could expect them to make a sensible decision. I know that's
                    contrary to the present perspective on Congress, but my own experience was, that
                    nearly all these guys were very hard working, very conscientious. All of them
                    were dependent upon someone, every member has some issues on which he has
                    absolutely no flexibility, because he's got a big donor, someone upon whom he's
                    heavily dependent, who has a strong position on something. No matter how
                    rational a change in the member's position might be, and no matter how much he
                    might realize and agree with you, that he ought to vote differently, he won't
                    budge. He can't budge. And I think that nearly every member has one or two spots
                    like that, or did at that time.</p>
                <p>But otherwise they were pretty much open to hearing different points of view, and
                    being convinced. I came away really very excited about the Congress, and very
                    upbeat about our democracy because it seemed to me that you really could deal
                    with nearly every issue, and that there was a way of getting the Congress, the
                    legislative branch, to review reasonable grievances, and to make the system
                    work.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the one that comes to mind, sort of the pressure
                        group, is the Israeli lobby, and there are other ones, but this is the
                        mightiest of them. How did you find dealing with that? Did you get involved
                        in it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: Very little. The issues that I was responsible for, namely NATO economic
                    policy, European communities, were not things which greatly interested the
                    Israelis. They had no direct concern about that. The one thing that I was very
                    much involved in, and which they cared a great deal about...now that you make me
                    think of it...was the question of Soviet immigration to Israel. The Israelis
                    always wanted more Jews to be able to leave the Soviet Union. And that led to
                    something called the Jackson-Vanick__ amendment. Mr. Jackson, a Senator from the
                    State of Washington—Scoop Jackson—a liberal in domestic affairs, and a
                    conservative in foreign affairs; and a guy named Vanick__ from Chicago, who was
                    a Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, came up with an amendment to some
                    law...I can't remember which one, which denied MFN benefits to the Soviet
                    Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it probably was Most Favored Nation, or even more
                        than that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>FINA: Yes, it was very restrictive of the Soviet Union, and they saw this as a
                    device for forcing the Soviet Union to release more Jews. There was a constant
                    flow of Jews out of the Soviet Union during this period. I don't remember how
                    many, but there was a flow. But they wanted more, and my recollection is that
                    the Israeli lobby was pushing this very hard. As soon as I realized what was
                    happening, and the Ways and Means Committee was my baby and therefore, I guess,
                    I got wind of it early on. I warned David Abshire of what I thought were the
                    negative implications of this. I thought it was a lousy idea, and he went to
                    Kissinger with whom he had, I think, quite good relations, and Kissinger was
                    opposed to the Jackson-Vanick__ amendment, at least in the beginning. We did
                    what we could to try to prevent that coming into being. But we lost rather badly
                    on that, whereas we had won on some other issues, but the Israeli lobby is very
                    powerful. And on this there was a lot of demagoguery, and poor calculation about
                    what would happen. The result was the Soviet Union cut off virtually all
                    immigration to Israel in retaliation. So you went from a situation where there
                    had been some more or less reasonable flow to almost nothing. And that didn't
                    change until Gorbachev and company came on line. So it was another poor
                    calculation in the cold war thinking that more toughness would force the Soviet
                    Union to back down. But toughness didn't have that effect upon them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It doesn't work with us, it doesn't work with them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: That's right. But that was something that is very hard to convince a lot of
                    people about, especially conservatives in this country who are basically force
                    oriented, rather than resolution oriented, compromise.</p>
                <p>Well, there were a lot of things that went on. One of the things that I was very
                    pleased with was the effort to prevent the reduction in our force levels in
                    Europe. Senator Mansfield, who at that time was the Majority Leader in the
                    Senate, wanted to make drastic cuts in the number of our troops assigned to NATO
                    and presence in Western Europe. And I was the guy who headed the task force to
                    try to convince the Congress not to do that. We did a lot of interesting things,
                    and we succeeded in convincing the Congress not to support Senator Mansfield. I
                    was pretty happy about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you go about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>FINA: It was a question of getting people to come down and testify, and to bring
                    them into private meetings with members. I don't remember whether I had McCloy,
                    but a whole bunch of eminent people of both parties who came down and met. I got
                    together a little booklet on NATO, and the costs of NATO, to demonstrate that we
                    were not paying a disproportionate share, we were not bearing a disproportionate
                    share of the burden. Once you get the facts out on paper where people can
                    actually see them, a lot of the myths disappear about what our role was. And I
                    devoted a lot of time to simply creating this little booklet that fitted in your
                    pocket that had all these little details in it. I was rather pleased with that.
                    It seemed to have some benign effect. I'm sure that what really counted was Mr.
                    Kissinger, and Mr. Nixon going to work on members, but I thought that I had also
                    had a part in defeating the Mansfield resolution.</p>
                <p>Although interestingly enough, President Nixon was not very good when it came to
                    lobbying the Congress. I remember that one of the things that repeatedly
                    disappointed David Abshire, and even the White House Congressional Relations
                    people, some of whom were pretty good, and some of whom were terrible, was that
                    it was very difficult to get the President to pick up the phone. Members of both
                    parties are very much influenced by the President contacting them personally. If
                    the President calls you and asks you to change your vote on something, and if he
                    has a fairly decent reason for doing it, it's very hard for a member to resist
                    that. It isn't a question of being promised judgeships, or favors, but if the
                    President says, “We need this for the United States,” members have a lot of
                    trouble resisting. But that, Nixon just wouldn't do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Nixon was following the preeminent man who was
                        practically born with a telephone in one ear, and that's President
                        Johnson.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: Yes, that's right. Johnson was a tremendous arm- twister, a jawboner, and I
                    never could understand why President Nixon, who lost a number of issues on the
                    Hill, was not willing to jawbone some people by phone. His people up on the
                    Hill, and those of us who were working with them, knew that this vote or that
                    vote could be swung if the President would do it. According to the scuttlebutt,
                    he just wouldn't do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nixon is one of these, if one looks at it, I mean he's a
                        very complex character, and these are the things that came out to haunt
                        him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: Yes. Whether it was because he didn't want to put himself in the position
                    of being beholden to some mere member of Congress...I don't know. But in terms
                    of accomplishing your legislative, or your executive agenda, the President
                    really has to play a leadership role in playing with the Congress.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>One of the things to David Abshire's great credit was, that he knew how to count.
                    And there's certainly no greater skill in working with the Congress than knowing
                    how to count. He was meticulous in keeping lists of members in committee, and in
                    the Congress as a whole, on issues and wanting to know how they were going to
                    vote. And we, foot soldiers up there, spent a lot of our time trying to
                    determine how members were going to vote, so you knew whom you had to influence.
                    In that respect David was very good. He just understood how that ought to be
                    done. There are other ways that I was dissatisfied with him...his politics were
                    somewhat to the right of mine! But in this he really was exemplary. I know it
                    was a disappointment to him that on issues that the White House thought were
                    crucial, you couldn't get the boss to pick up the phone.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>FINA: The one other major project that I handled that pleased me was defeat of
                    efforts to transfer foreign commercial responsibility from State to Commerce.
                    For some time there had been an effort by the Department of Commerce and its
                    friends on the Hill to transfer the commercial reporting and trade promotion
                    functions of State from it to the Department of Commerce. During my watch in H,
                    this effort was renewed and there was an excellent chance that Congress would
                    legislate the change.</p>
                <p>State was opposed and I was given the project of stopping it. I chaired a little
                    task force representing various parts of the Department to marshal the arguments
                    and to get people to help my lobby. My recollection is that this battle was won
                    almost entirely by lobbying committee staff members - in the Senate principally.
                    After a rather long period, we won and the initiative to take this function from
                    State was dropped. Later, after I was at my next post, I learned that Kissinger
                    had acquiesced in shifting the entire function to Commerce. That led to the
                    creation of the Commerce Foreign Commercial Service, another lamentable
                    splintering of responsibility in the conduct of our foreign affairs.</p>
                <p>There were other events like the staff lunch series, but suffice it to say that I
                    had a wonderful time working with the Congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One question, let me ask. One of the complaints that I've
                        heard surface again and again was that the Department of State, and
                        particularly the Foreign Service, didn't have a proper appreciation of
                        keeping in touch with Congress. I mean to get them on their side. Obviously
                        this is your job, but did you find that within the rest of the Foreign
                        Service, the Department of State, there was a problem in getting them to
                        devote the time that they should to Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>FINA: Yes, I think that's very perceptive, and you remind me of what was a
                    continuing issue. I think that criticism is justified, that the Department of
                    State, and the Foreign Service, pretty much wanted to stay away from the
                    Congress when it could. There were some exceptions. There were some guys who
                    were very good up there, and had good connections, and knew that they were good,
                    and that this served their careers, and also served the substance of what they
                    were trying to do. But for the most part I think it's true that Foreign Service
                    officers, and Department people, really wanted to stay away from the political
                    brawl. And oddly enough, frequently I don't think they were sufficiently...I
                    don't think they could explain themselves in the kind of language that members
                    and staff could readily understand. Sometimes you get too involved in the
                    details of what you're doing professionally, to be able then to communicate with
                    laymen. Many of the members of Congress have to be laymen on an awful lot of
                    issues. They're specialized in some, but they're not in others. You're quite
                    right, that was always a problem. The wise Bureau, it seems to me, would have
                    tried to keep a line open to Congress and keep up a constant exchange of views.
                    I think it can't just be one directional, its got to be an exchange. So you
                    understand the concerns of the Congress, and you factor those into what you're
                    trying to do, and at the same time that you try to keep the members aware of the
                    significant aspects of what you're trying to do about which they have a
                    legitimate concern.</p>
                <p>That didn't happen very often from my recollection. In fact all the bureaus had
                    an officer who was supposed to be their Congressional relations person. Some of
                    them were all right. I don't know that I can remember any who was really very
                    good. It was always sort of a second rank job. I'm not sure exactly why that was
                    except that Foreign Service people tended to think that they really wanted to
                    deal with foreigners, who are more fun to deal with than members of Congress,
                    who come from an even more foreign land.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FINA: I was assigned to Milan as Consul General, and that was the first sort of
                    normal Foreign Service assignment that I had ever had. I'd begun in intelligence
                    research which was an odd-ball thing. I'd been assigned to Europe to the OECD
                    which was an odd-ball thing, the European communities were odd-ball, back in the
                    Department backing them up was out of the usual track, the same could be said
                    for Congressional Relations, and the Arms Control. They were all tangential to
                    what is thought of as sort of the core activity of the Department of State which
                    usually centers around starting as a vice consul, and becoming an
                    ambassador.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>So this job as Consul General was pretty interesting, and going back to Italy was
                    especially attractive to me because since I had gotten out of Italian affairs,
                    after my disagreement with the Department's position on the separation of the
                    communists and the socialists back in the 1950s. It had taken, what, 20 some
                    years to overcome that particular little problem? And in the end I only got this
                    job because of the friendship of Republicans!</p>

                        of the EUR establishment somewhat later as Consul General to Naples, I know
                        these Consul General jobs, particularly in Italy are held like little jewels
                        in the EUR establishment hands, and you didn't belong to anybody's
                        establishment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: No, I was not a member of the EUR inner circle, to say the least. What
                    happened was that, in Congressional Relations the White House assigned one of
                    its people from Kissinger's staff to the Department to be the Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary for Congressional Relations. David Abshire had wanted to put me in
                    that job, and he told me that he was nominating me for Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary, which I thought would be great. I was enjoying the job enormously, I
                    liked the Congress, I liked what I was doing. Even if I was out of sympathy with
                    the Nixon administration the things that I was doing were things that I believed
                    in. I wasn't obliged to do things on Vietnam where I was increasingly uncertain,
                    and the Nixon administration position on keeping troops in NATO, and on
                    multilateral trade negotiations, GATT, and so on, those were all things of which
                    I was very supportive as I was of some of their other activities.</p>
                <p>So I was glad for the opportunity to get on, and David proposed me as Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary. Unfortunately, the White House must have gotten wind of the
                    fact that I had views that were not exactly safe Republican views, and I was
                    black-balled. I'd moved into the office, I was settling my papers in the desk, I
                    was feeling hot-dog, I'd made it. And then the announcement came that, in fact,
                    I had not made it, and the White House wouldn't approve.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>So that increased my interest in leaving H, and going somewhere else. Then
                    Personnel told me that this job was up in Milan, there were a lot of competitors
                    for it. But interestingly enough, the guy who had been brought over from the
                    White House to fill the job that I had thought that I was going to get, was a
                    32-year old Republican whiz kid, who had restaffed the Arms Control Agency after
                    Nixon's second term, and cleaned out all the guys who had been responsible for
                    the SALT negotiations because that had been part of the political deal that
                    Senator Jackson had made with the White House. The conservatives were being paid
                    off by purging all these people of dubious wisdom who were in the Arms Control,
                    and in the Department of State, for their role in the SALT treaties. Anyway,
                    this guy appeared on the scene and he knew nothing about nothing when it came to
                    the Department of State or foreign affairs. However, I rapidly discovered he was
                    a very attractive person, and he was open to learning, was interested, and very
                    candid about what he was doing, and what he had been doing in the White House.
                    He escaped the Watergate thing by a hair although his buddies were implicated
                    and dragged through the courts and the hearings, etc., but he, Stanton D.
                    Anderson by name, escaped all that. Anyway, I became very fond of him. I thought
                    he was really a very able, well-intentioned, and intelligent person, who wanted
                    to do the right thing. And he rapidly caught on to what he was supposed to do. I
                    thought he was very impressive.</p>
                <p>Anyway, about that time, I found out about the Milan job, and it kept escaping
                    from my grasp. There were always further meetings, there were always further
                    problems, there were other candidates. In the end there were supposed to be
                    objections by other agencies to my getting this job. I'd been keeping Stan
                    Anderson informed of this, and he said, “Why don't I see what I can find out
                    about this.” After all, he had been in the personnel business in the White
                    House, and had been fixing these things. So he called the Secretary of
                    Agriculture, whose name I mercifully forget, and found out that he really didn't
                    give a damn about who was assigned there although I had been told by Personnel
                    that the obstacle to my getting Milan was that Agriculture had put a hold on it.
                    The Byzantine life of the personnel business.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Stan made a couple more telephone calls, and I was presently informed
                    that in fact I had been paneled and I had gone through, and I was going to be
                    Consul General in Milan. So I owe that, not to my buddies in the Foreign
                    Service, but to a Republican, and a Nixon Republican at that!</p>

                    the Democratic Party.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>FINA: Well, Stan Anderson, after leaving the Department I might say, has had a
                    very successful career. I forget whether he made his first hundred million, or
                    whatever it was very shortly thereafter. He's now running a lobbying firm here
                    in town, and he's been a lobbyist for the Japanese and one of the principal
                    organizers of the Republican conventions. Anyway, suffice it to say that I would
                    never have gotten a decent job after Congressional Relations, if it hadn't been
                    for the friendship of this Nixonian Republican.</p>
                <p>So I went to Milan, and found it a rather dismal post, run down, sort of
                    neglected, and with a long tradition of trying to do as little as possible
                    because the embassy didn't really want other people second guessing it on
                    political, or economic, things. You were supposed to stick to airgrams about
                    local agricultural affairs, or something like that, but certainly not be
                    involved in anything that the political section in Rome cared about. Well,
                    inasmuch as I was interested in everything, I was into everything. and I wanted
                    to make the Consulate function the way I thought a government office should. It
                    should serve the public.</p>
                <p>So my period there was one of, I would guess, relatively high profile. I got rid
                    of people whom I thought were not doing anything, and I insisted that we do
                    various things. We remodeled the Consulate, got in new contemporary furniture
                    (Knoll) since I wanted Milan to see that we were living in the present, creative
                    world. We took down partitions which allowed local employees to close their
                    doors and be insulated from that nasty public out there that wanted visas or
                    other services. I opened it all up so that there was no place you could hide
                    from the public. That was a revolutionary concept when I got there, but I wanted
                    both the consuls, and the local employees, to be serving the public whether it
                    was the American public, or the Italian public. I figured we were there to serve
                    them. And I wanted them out, visible and available, and being nice to people.
                    Well, there was a lot of time spent on doing things like that, some deadwood in
                    the locals who were hard to get rid of but eventually they retired, or we moved
                    them, or something. And I thought that the Consulate became a pretty effective
                    and active place, because I asked a lot.</p>
                <p>I gave people a lot of responsibility and I urged them to do things. My theory
                    was that we should know everybody in our Consular district, which incidentally
                    ran from the Turin consular district, which was Piedmont, all the way to
                    Trieste. We had the whole of northern Italy down almost as far as Bologna, a big
                    consular district. And I wanted to know everybody who counted, and I wanted them
                    to know us. I wanted our people to go out and visit them, to find out what they
                    were doing, and to know them before the problems arose so that when something
                    happened, we could call up and go see someone who already knew us. We shouldn't
                    have to make the acquaintance of some guy for the first time when we needed him.
                    So we drew up lists of the people who counted, and assigned them to people as
                    their contacts, and we went out and did it. I traveled a lot through the
                    consular district, constantly calling on all the right people, the prefect, the
                    bishop, the cardinals, the leaders of industry, trade union leaders, all the
                    political parties and the press.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>Another aspect of my tenure in Milan was having a very active social schedule. I
                    tried to know everyone who counted politically or economically. That meant a lot
                    of entertaining. To do that within the rather tight budget that I had, nearly
                    all was done at our residence. My wife supervised it all and did all of the
                    shopping. In one year we had some 1,500 guests!</p>
                <p>My access was increased when I became Dean of the Consular Corps in Milan. There
                    was a large consular community and some friction between it and the government
                    for very silly reasons. The Mexican Consul General made a big fuss about the
                    Prefect not giving an annual dinner for the Consular Corps! I tried to clear
                    that up and turned it into a quite active group which gave me further entry to
                    both the consular community and to the Italian community. It was a lot of work,
                    but it advanced the interests of the United States.</p>
                <p>Our residence was a new apartment that we had leased and furnished with
                    contemporary furnishings and art. I had small lunches there with every sort of
                    local leader and we also had larger receptions on July 4 which reached out to
                    the broadest range of Italians. I did not want to spend our limited funds on the
                    American community, so I organized a community picnic funded with private
                    donations. That worked pretty well except that our Foreign Service people got
                    stuck with all the dirty work. So that had some drawbacks.</p>
                <p>I was in a very happy position at this time of having John Volpe, a Massachusetts
                    Republican, as ambassador. He arrived in Rome a day or two before I arrived in
                    Milan. John Volpe was an unusual man. He was a Republican, and I was a (closet)
                    Democrat, although I didn't advertise the fact. He was a very energetic and
                    committed Catholic. I was an atheist. He was a sort professional Italo-American
                    which I certainly wasn't. But he had a lot of qualities which I very much
                    respected. And one of the first things he did, which has endeared him to me ever
                    since, was that he changed our policy with respect to dealing with the
                    Communists. From the time that I had entered the Department of State in the
                    1950s, until I got to Milan in 1973, it had been forbidden for Foreign Service
                    Officers to deal with Communists. Until the 1960s you had not been permitted to
                    speak with many socialists. Well, I thought that was absolutely idiotic. And I
                    was so delighted when...I forget how it came about, but I asked for authority to
                    deal with everybody, to talk to everybody, to report on everybody. And Bob
                    Beaudry, who was the Deputy Chief of Mission in Rome to Volpe, a very fine
                    career Foreign Service Officer, a very professional guy...I don't know how he
                    brought it about, but at any rate Volpe agreed. And Volpe believed in it. His
                    view was, that if you didn't talk to the enemy and understand them, how could
                    you possibly know how to cope with the problems they were creating for you. So
                    eminently sensible, but that was a politician, that wasn't a professional
                    diplomat. That was a man who had lived his political life competing with, and
                    rubbing shoulders with his Democratic opposition in Massachusetts. He had a much
                    more sophisticated view of dealing with your political enemies than this very
                    ideological approach that I think the Foreign Service had taken, and which was
                    undoubtedly caused in large part by the McCarthy period.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>Well, suffice it to say, that I began my contacts by dealing with all the
                    political parties, and wherever I went whether it was Milan, or Venice, or
                    anywhere else, I methodically saw them all. I saw the Christian Democrats, the
                    socialists, the communists, the neo-fascists, whoever it was that was a
                    political party, who counted. I wanted to go around and meet them, and interview
                    them, and hear what they had to say. I did that in every provincial capital of
                    my territory...it seems to me there were ten, or something like that, or
                    twelve.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's amazing how divided as Italy is to areas (overlap
                        conversation)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: There's a great deal of decentralization, and long cultural history for all
                    these places like Mantua, or Varese, or Verona, and Como. Each one of those
                    places is a little society, and a little world. My objective was to go and see
                    them all, talk to them all, find out what they had to say. So I began a series
                    of telegrams, not airgrams, called “Cable from Mantua”. Each place I went to I
                    wrote a reporting cable.</p>
                <p>Well, those cables gave me great grief, and great pleasure. I love to write, and
                    I love to report, and I dealt with all the major political, and economic issues,
                    that faced these areas. I reported with as much candor as possible without
                    regard to whether that jibed or didn't jibe with the political views of either
                    the ambassador or the political section, or much less, the desk in Washington. I
                    believed strongly that somebody ought to be telling it the way it is. You may
                    draw different conclusions, but my job was to tell you what they're saying in
                    Mantua, and what they doing in Bergamo, or what they're saying and what they're
                    doing in Trento, or what they're saying and doing elsewhere. You owe it to your
                    government to tell it exactly the way you see it. Washington can disregard your
                    truth. It can conclude you're wrong, but you should never fix your reporting to
                    suit your listeners. And that's what I did.</p>
                <p>Well, the ambassador was very good about that. He was very supportive. The
                    political section in Rome, I think, had a constant case of indigestion from
                    these cables. One reason for that was that I sent them as cables, and therefore
                    they got back to the Department of State, and somebody read them. Airgrams
                    traditionally have gone to the researchers, and no one has paid any attention to
                    them because you're submerged in material. And I wasn't interested in writing
                    for the archives. My cables were sufficiently lively to be read. They not
                    infrequently got passed up to the Secretary of State, and I heard about it. I
                    heard about it in complaints from the embassy saying that I was getting too much
                    attention for a point of view which was obviously wrong! All this business about
                    how the communists were no longer communists, and how the Christian Democrats
                    were stealing out of the public treasury. This thing only misled people back in
                    the Department. You shouldn't do it.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>On the other hand, Beaudry and the ambassador didn't try to stop me. I certainly
                    didn't make any friends among the traditional right wing Foreign Service
                    community. They didn't like being upstaged by a guy in Milan who was dealing
                    with all the hot issues of the day, and with national level political leaders to
                    whom I had access, and who were very, very willing to see me, and to talk with
                    me. That included Cardinal Giovanni Colombo, who was the Archbishop of Milan,
                    who at one time was in the running for the Papacy. I think he would have been
                    very good, a very impressive man. On the other hand, it was his colleague the
                    Patriarch of Venice who got the job, who in my view, was really a second rater.
                    I had seen him regularly when I went to Venice. I always call on the Patriarch.
                    An incredible experience to go Venice and call on the Patriarch of Venice, and
                    you think of the history that lies behind him. But he really was not...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was this:</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: This may have been Pope John Paul, anyway he's the Pope who had a very
                    short reign.</p>
                <p>Well, suffice it to say that I was busy reporting from all over the area, and
                    obviously making the political section very unhappy. And, I guess, to make
                    things worse, the ambassador started picking up my stuff as an example of what
                    he wanted all consular posts to do. Some of them could and some of them
                    couldn't. Some of them were interested and some of them weren't. If I had had
                    only career aspirations, I would have done things differently. I had career
                    aspirations, but I also had substantive interests in what I thought ought to be
                    done.</p>
                <p>Volpe was a fascinating man, but he certainly caused us all unlimited anguish
                    because of his Italian-Americanism. I don't know whether you were there
                    when...</p>

                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>FINA: He was such a nice, decent person in many ways, although he was pretty
                    tight, I guess. The people who worked with him in Rome thought he was
                    tight-fisted. I think what agonized us all was that when he'd come to visit, and
                    we wanted ambassadorial visits...these pastoral progressions, around the country
                    were important in public relations terms. He insisted upon speaking Italian, and
                    while he speaks and spoke impeccable English, excellent grammatical English with
                    a fine accent, no one could ever fault him on his English; when he shifted to
                    Italian, it was just awful. He spoke, and speaks the Italian of an uneducated
                    mountain peasant from central Italy. He's very articulate, and undoubtedly in
                    Massachusetts, and the Massachusetts political milieu with lots of Italian
                    immigrants, lots of people with that kind of a background who still speak
                    kitchen Italian, it must have been a tremendous asset. But in Italy there is a
                    racism something like that of the United States with regard to blacks, and it's
                    based on your cultural level, or your social standing. The minute you open your
                    mouth, you're typed by any Italian. He knows immediately where you stand in the
                    social scale, whether you're educated or uneducated, whether you're from the
                    north or the south. And unfortunately the movers and shakers in Italy are, for
                    the most part, the educated, traditional, upper- class. Ambassador Volpe sounded
                    to them as lower class, which he certainly wasn't. And when they weren't
                    laughing at him behind his back, they were disdaining him. It was very
                    humiliating for those of us who wanted the United States to look good to see our
                    ambassador tarred like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did anybody tell him this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: Oh, it's a very hard thing to tell an ambassador something like that! He
                    was such a nice man. We'd beg him to read an Italian text. And USIA, which was
                    as conscious of this problem as any of us, always prepared him fine speeches.
                    They were good literate Italian, and he could read it properly if he wanted to.
                    But he'd always arrive at the rostrum and say, “Well, the staff has written this
                    for me, but I want to speak to you as paisani”, or something like that. And he
                    would then launch into his idiomatic Italian. He had them rolling in the aisles
                    in some ways. He had this wonderful electric communication with people, but in
                    the end there was disdain for the man among the movers and shakers, at least
                    those who did not really know him. What the common man thought, I don't know.
                    But among trade unionists, among business leaders, among government officials,
                    in my area, they were not very generous about him. The problem has been that so
                    often we've sent ambassadors to Italy who were beneath the dignity of the United
                    States to send. There have been some good ones, but often they have been second
                    raters. Ambassador Volpe was not a second rater, but he appeared to be in the
                    eyes of many of these people because of his vanity, and because of this
                    insensitivity to the cultural world in which an ambassador has to live.</p>
                <p>His successor was an entirely different kettle of fish, and that was Richard
                    Gardner. Did you work for Gardner?</p>

                <p>FINA: Absolutely. He understood all the issues. There was never any question
                    about Richard Gardner understanding the issues, being sensitive to the politics.
                    He had a great command of what was going on, and he was a great credit to the
                    United States in many respects. He made an excellent impression upon Italians.
                    From my point of view, he was very supportive, very complimentary, he was very
                    good to me.Among the things that I very much respected in him, was that even
                    though he disagreed with my views on the central issue of the Communists, he
                    never tried to close off open discussion.</p>
                <p>I reached the conclusion toward the end of my tour in Milan that we really ought
                    to favor the reconciliation of the communists, and bring them into the
                    government. It was a time when the Christian Democrats were struggling for
                    majority, it was the period of the Brigate Rosse, the Red Brigades, the
                    kidnapping, the knee cappings, a very fascinating, and very tense period in
                    political and national security terms. I concluded, after several years of
                    getting to know these people, and really spending a lot of time working at the
                    grass roots...or at any rate, at the provincial level, getting to know the
                    political leaders, that it would have been in our interest to have favored
                    bringing the communists into the government. They were no longer loyal to the
                    Soviet Union. They were no longer a subversive threat to anybody. They had
                    become a bourgeois party, sort of a liberal democratic, or a liberal socialist
                    party. All of the Stalinist, Leninist, revolutionary, totalitarian stuff, had
                    gone down the drain sometime after Czechoslovakia, from my experience.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>FINA: The leadership, and I don't know that much about the followership, but the
                    guys at the trade union level, or the provincial, and city level communist party
                    were about as committed to the democratic system as anyone could be, and a great
                    deal more honest than their Christian Democratic counterparts. Anyway, I came to
                    the conclusion, I suppose around '77, that we really ought to be moving in that
                    direction. So I said so. Well, Gardner had come to Italy announcing as he left
                    the United States that there was going to be a new policy with respect to
                    dealing with the communists. We were now going to talk to them. Of course, that
                    had been the policy that Volpe had established in 1973, but somehow or other
                    that had never gotten back to Gardner, and maybe never gotten back to
                    Washington! I don't know. Volpe certainly was not the kind to advertise it. But
                    Gardner was, and he no sooner arrived in Rome, than Evans and Novak, as I
                    recall, zapped him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were conservative columnist of the nasty ilk.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: That's right. I think they did a column in which they really zapped him for
                    being soft on communism, and a woolly-minded liberal. He really got raked over
                    the coals by them. Well, that slowed him down to an impressive degree, and from
                    then on he was very, very guarded on this question. He didn't stop me from
                    continuing my contacts with the communists. But he certainly discouraged
                    everybody else. As I say, I always appreciated the fact that he was willing to
                    let me continue writing things which were contrary to the advice he was getting
                    from his very conservative political section, and from his staff, including his
                    new DCM (Allan Holmes) who was career minded at all costs, who later became an
                    ambassador without any particular contribution to the interests of the United
                    States, in my view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Bob Paganelli?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: No, this was another guy...what was his name. I've a Freudian inability to
                    remember some people whom I want to forget! Suffice it to say, that despite the
                    pressure he had from his staff, he never tried to censor what I was writing,
                    which was diametrically opposed to what the embassy was then saying, and what he
                    was saying. And when we had national meetings of the staff in Rome, and so on,
                    he was very willing to listen to my different point of view. I found myself
                    alone, I think, among all the consuls and consuls general, and the staff, in
                    advocating this point of view. He was willing to hear it, he never tried to
                    squelch me, and for that I was very grateful.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, my regret about Richard Gardner was, and is, that it seemed
                    that his ambition was so great that there was no substantive issue which
                    couldn't be modified, if that were necessary, for what he conceived to be his
                    career interests.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FINA: It may have been. I don't know. I never attempted to divine what he wanted
                    to do, but he was ambitious and wanted to rise in political influence, and
                    stature, etc. He had all the abilities to do that, but there was this overriding
                    ambition which unfortunately colored, as far as I could see, everything that he
                    did. And I thought that was too bad because here was a man with great natural
                    endowment, a wonderful education, a charming person with whom to work, but with
                    what I considered to be a flaw for a public servant. Not an uncommon flaw, but
                    in an ambassador, or a person of his abilities it turns out to look bigger and
                    be bigger just because he's got more authority, and he's got more ability than
                    the average...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you think of any examples of how this played out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: Well, I think it was principally in this question of dealing with the
                    communists, or what the relation of the communist could be. I think that he was
                    so spooked by the public criticism of his initial declaration of a willingness
                    to dialogue with everybody. There were, I think, other things, too, that escape
                    me. He was very friendly with, or attempted to be very friendly with Brzezinski,
                    who was at that time the National Security Adviser. I must say that I didn't
                    think much of Mr. Brzezinski. I had known him when he was on the Policy Planning
                    Staff in the Department of State. I think he was a very intellectually alert,
                    and stimulating person, but unfortunately his Polish background gave him a
                    special perspective on anything that had to do with the Soviet Union. That, in
                    my view, distorted his picture of what was in the interests of the United
                    States. And Richard Gardner needed to remain on good terms with Brzezinski
                    whatever his own personal views may have been. I think that influenced his
                    position in a conservative way on a lot of the issues that we faced.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking about the political section in Rome, I served in
                        Naples as Consul General from '79 to '81. I came not from a political
                        reporting background, basically a consular background, and maybe it showed
                        my consular upbringing or something, but I have the feeling that the
                        political section there, in Rome, spent an awful lot of time trying to
                        figure out who was in what position in that minuet called the national
                        political scene. I mean, you'd have an election and there would be in those
                        days a difference of two or three percentage points. Nothing had changed
                        since 1948, and we used to get cables saying, “What do you think of the
                        latest alignment?” You'd get sort of a blank look when you talked to the
                        local officials there because they didn't pay any attention to this. Did you
                        feel that the political section in our embassy in Rome was more or less
                        caught up in the exquisite detail of...Italian politics was very
                        interesting, but as far as American interests are concerned, nothing had
                        really changed. This was sort of my impression.</hi>

                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>FINA: I think I would share that view. I wouldn't have thought of putting it
                    quite that way, but I do think that the political section in Rome, as long as I
                    can remember it, and I remember it from the 1950s, was always involved in this
                    minutiae without ever looking at the big picture. They started with certain
                    fixed views that all communists were subversive, bad, and enemies. Until the
                    Kennedy administration, all socialists were really communists. The only really
                    reliable people were the Christian Democrats, and then there were these other
                    little parties that were frivolous, and needed to be kept in line to maintain a
                    parliamentary majority. It all revolved around how you achieved these majorities
                    to continue to rule with a minimum of attention being given to the macro picture
                    of what's really happening in Italy, what's happening to the global economy,
                    what's happening to society as a whole. And without giving any consideration to
                    whether our interests might not lie in some fundamental changes in how Italy was
                    governed. So I agree with you. That certainly was my impression over all the
                    years.</p>
                <p>It was a rare period when you got anybody in that political section who was able
                    to get any perspective on the overall picture. I always thought the air in that
                    embassy in Rome must have been recirculated from the 1940s to the present, and
                    there was something miasmic about it. You began to breathe it and before you
                    knew it you were involved in these Byzantine maneuvers about an unreal world in
                    which communism and anti-communism were the two great symbols, and long after
                    that had any real meaning for the interests of the United States, in my opinion.
                    At any rate, it was still that way when I was Consul General, but I sure as hell
                    didn't accept that, and that, I'm sure, prevented my ever getting an onward
                    assignment because when I got through in Milan, Gardner was very nice, and he
                    actually asked me, and urged me to stay longer. But my view was that I'd put in
                    six or seven years, it was a wonderful time. I enjoyed it enormously, I liked my
                    job, but if I was going to get anywhere in career terms, I had to stop being a
                    Consul General, I had to go somewhere to be a DCM, or an ambassador. And I
                    thought, if I can't get a better job then I've got now, then I ought to get out,
                    because the Department of State, the Foreign Service, even at that time was
                    shrinking, and everyone knew there were fewer and fewer interesting jobs around.
                    Then, too, I was getting older, and the question was, do I stay on here in this
                    really nice job where I know everyone, where I've got a lot of prestige, and I'm
                    living a very fine life. Or do I face reality and say, either I get a better
                    job, or I get out. So I declined to continue. I suppose I could have continued a
                    couple more years, I declined to continue.</p>
                <p>I went back to Washington, and started walking the halls. In the end after
                    endless hall walking, I decided I had to get out. I was not going to get a job.
                    I had difficulty enough getting an interesting job in the Carter administration
                    where Brzezinski had a very conservative influence. And when it became clear to
                    my disbelief that Ronald Reagan was going to be elected President...</p>

                    got back to the United States. When it happened I said, “Man, they won't even
                    give me a job sweeping halls in this place, and I don't want to be around.”
                    Moreover, there was a question of money. I had become an FSO-1 and so was at the
                    top of the scale. But the income was capped by the rule that it could not exceed
                    that of a Member of the House and the penny pinching required to support my
                    family under those circumstances was very painful. I was tired of having to be
                    so tight fisted with my children.</p>
                <p>So I began job hunting, and I found a job in the private sector which I'm very
                    glad I took because it was very stimulating. That was the end of my career with
                    the Department of State. I am grateful for the opportunity that it provided to
                    my and my wife to make a contribution to the interests of the United States. But
                    it neither made me rich or famous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'll tell you it made you famous in one way—I can
                        only speak for one person—I read all your cables. Before I went out I had a
                        little time before I came from Seoul to be the Consul General, and I read
                        with great pleasure your cables, and they were the only reporting ones
                        reporting from Italy that seemed to make sense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: Thank you, sono commosso!.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the point being that they were there, and I think they
                        have become part of the business which isn't true in most cases of those
                        posts. So there is a legacy. I'm not saying this as a compliment, I'm saying
                        this as a fact.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: Thank you, I'd never known what happened to my cables. I had various people
                    mention them to me on one occasion or another. However, they did not enhance my
                    career prospects. Still, I look back on them without any regret because I tried
                    to be as honest as I could, and sometimes honesty is rewarded, and sometimes it
                    is penalized. But when you're honest at the wrong time, you get no benefits.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think probably more than that was the fact that
                        although you had served for some time as Consul General, you were not really
                        part of the European establishment back in the Department. I know this, once
                        you're out, when you come back you just don't belong to anybody, and that
                        was a particularly trying time. A couple years later I joined you in the
                        hall ranks, and unless you had a home office, and some people who cared for
                        you in Washington, you weren't going to go anywhere.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>FINA: I think that's absolutely right. If you didn't have a patron, a sponsor,
                    who was taking care of you. Just as in any European court, or in the Soviet
                    Union, or anywhere else, you didn't have much of a chance unless you have
                    extraordinary talents which I cannot pretend. And in my particular case, all of
                    my patrons, the Bob Schaetzels and Jack Tuthills, were out because there had
                    been a change in policy and they were out of favor. So I was really navigating
                    purely on my own, and you just don't get very far when you are as independent in
                    thinking as I was. After my last patron, Stan Anderson, intervened to get me the
                    job in Milan, there was no one left. While Dick Gardner offered to help, his
                    influence was limited. And the interesting jobs available were precious few.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was cut off.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: He didn't have the kind of clout in the Department. As I say, in
                    retrospect, I've no regrets. It was a wonderful experience. I learned a lot. I
                    hope I did some service for my country. One never knows. Our policy towards
                    Italy hasn't greatly changed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what's there to change?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: That's right. The Italians are doing it for themselves, and they're being
                    very successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to thank you very much, Tom.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINA: It's I who thank you for having taken the time to listen to the
                    recollections of an old soldier.</p>
