                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if we could start by your giving a little
                        background about where you came from and how you got educated, so people
                        will have an idea of who you are.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE:I was born and reared in a small town in Pennsylvania, Tamaqua, about 100
                    miles north of Philadelphia. I attended high school there, and after graduation
                    I went on to Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania, where I took my Bachelor
                    of Arts degree in 1937.</p>
                <p>After graduation, I went abroad for a year's study. I had won a fellowship, which
                    was administered in those days under the auspices of the Institute of
                    International Education (IIE) in New York, and it provided for a fellowship to
                    go to France for study.</p>
                <p>I chose, of course, to study in Paris. But everybody chooses that, so I was
                    farmed out to one of the other universities and went to the University of
                    Bordeaux in France for a year's study.</p>
                <p>As it turned out, it was probably a very good thing that I didn't get to Paris
                    because I went to Bordeaux where no one spoke English at all. And so I spent the
                    whole year speaking nothing but French. I don't think I spoke a word of English
                    the whole year I was there. And I did learn to speak French, and went to French
                    classes, and took a degree at the end of the year, which was a Dipl�me des Touts
                    Universitaires, for which I wrote an essay roughly the equivalent of an M.A.</p>
                <p>This whetted my appetite for things French and French literature, so I came back
                    and went to Yale University where I also had a fellowship, a university
                    fellowship, and I took my Ph.D. there in 1942.</p>
                <p>During the last three or four years of my stay there, I also taught at French at
                    Yale College. I thought I wanted to go into a university career of teaching.
                    Indeed I think I would have, had World War II not come along. But with the Draft
                    Board breathing down my neck in 1942, I had to hurry up and get that degree. I
                    got the degree in June of '42. I did manage to finish.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>While I was putting the finishing touches on my Ph.D. dissertation and still
                    teaching, the Navy came along to Yale, a gentleman named Captain Heinmarsh, who
                    was recruiting for the Japanese Language School. He said he would take anyone
                    into the program who had a Phi Beta Kappa key or who had been born in Japan.</p>
                <p>Those were the two requirements; you had to have one or the other. I did happen
                    to have a Phi Beta Kappa key. I didn't know a word of Japanese, had not been
                    born in Japan, but I interviewed him. I thought this might be an interesting
                    assignment for the war, and he promised all sorts of things for the teaching of
                    the Japanese language.</p>
                <p>He said that, indeed, we were going to use the most advanced techniques possible,
                    and that we would wake up in the morning thinking Japanese after having heard it
                    in our dreams and sleep. He made this sound very romantic and very
                    worthwhile.</p>
                <p>So, of course, a number of us there signed up from Yale. We had quite a
                    contingent from Yale that went out to the Japanese Language School, which was
                    supposed to be in San Francisco. But at that time they had to move the Nisei out
                    of California, you'll recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Nisei being the Japanese Americans born in the United
                        States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: So they had to reestablish the school. They put it in Boulder, Colorado, at
                    the University of Colorado. I spent a year there studying Japanese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might add here that I went to the Army Language School
                        and took Russian in 1951, and I got exactly the same pitch about living and
                        dreaming and breathing Russian.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE:As it turned out, it wasn't done that way at all. It was the most
                    disappointing experience. As one who had studied languages, taken a Ph.D. in
                    French language and literature, and taught French, I was very disappointed in
                    this.</p>
                <p>We learned everything by rote. One difficulty was, as I told you earlier, we had
                    only a handful of people in this country, native Americans, who knew Japanese. I
                    think we had maybe four of five Naval Attach�s who had studied in Japan. And, of
                    course, they weren't available to teach us.So what the Navy had to do was bring
                    in these Nisei. They picked up truck drivers, gardeners, anybody they could lay
                    their hands on, who spoke Japanese. And of course, they did speak Japanese well,
                    some of them, but they had never taught anything. They knew nothing about
                    teaching.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>I remember when we were learning all this by rote, I used to say, “Can't you get
                    us a grammar book, so that we can learn some grammar and don't have to learn
                    everything by rote? We could at least rely on some rules for learning the
                    language.” I distinctly remember one of the teachers telling me, “Well, there is
                    no grammar in Japanese.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any language has construction and grammar.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: They didn't know. They could speak Japanese, they could write Japanese.</p>
                <p>Another thing we did, we spent an inordinate amount of time learning to write
                    Japanese. And it's a very difficult language, as you know, to write. We had to
                    learn how to write thousands of these Kanji, the Japanese characters.</p>
                <p>That proved totally useless when we got out in the field. If they had thought
                    about it beforehand, they wouldn't have done it this way, because who would we
                    be writing to in Japanese? As language officers we wouldn't be writing to
                    anybody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a familiar concept, I'm afraid. That's the
                        academic not really thinking in terms of the practical.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: Well, these weren't even the academics. Heinmarsh, I think, knew Japanese.
                    His intentions were all right, but once he had recruited, he had nothing to do
                    with the program. And I think he meant it to be better, but it wasn't.</p>
                <p>We had a woman running it who had lived in Japan. She was fine, herself, but she
                    simply couldn't get a faculty together that was worth its salt. So it was a
                    disappointing experience.</p>
                <p>We did learn some Japanese and went out in the field. I could read it during the
                    war, and we either were translators or interpreters when we'd get out in the
                    field. We spent too much time learning to write, which we never used.</p>
                <p>After World War II, when I finished my assignment in the Pacific, I was first
                    stationed in Australia at MacArthur's headquarters in a pool of Japanese
                    language officers that included our main Navy, British officers, Australian
                    officers, Dutch, and maybe a few others.</p>
                <p>It was called ATIS, Allied Translators and Interpreters Services. All of the
                    language people in the Pacific were put in this pool. And when there was an
                    assignment in the field, they just dipped into the pool and took you out,
                    regardless of your nationality or service.I was chosen to take part in the Leyte
                    invasion. I was assigned to Tenth Corps of the Army, even though I was a Naval
                    officer.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>They asked me what military training I had had, in order to participate in this
                    invasion, and I said, “Well, really, I was in language school; we didn't have
                    any military preparation.” They said, “Well, you'll have to have some.”</p>
                <p>So they sent me out one afternoon to a rifle range. That was the extent of my
                    military preparation. I shot for the afternoon on the rifle range.</p>
                <p>I was given a carbine and got into the field. I was told how to take this apart
                    and put it together. I had to carry it the whole time I was in the field, but,
                    fortunately, I didn't have to shoot it, because I'm not sure that I would have
                    hit the target.</p>
                <p>Anyway, after the Philippines, my time in the Pacific was up. The Navy had a
                    rotation policy, contrary to the Army, and after two years you were brought back
                    to the States.</p>
                <p>I was brought back to Washington, where I met my wife who happened to be a WAVE
                    officer during the war. She was in Communications Services.</p>
                <p>Then at the end of the war, I had to make a major career decision. I happened to
                    be in the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) at the end of the war, doing
                    general intelligence work on the Far East.</p>
                <p>I was briefing the head of ONI daily on what the major events were in the Far
                    East during the preceding 24 hours, going through cable traffic, newspapers, and
                    everything else to put these stories together. I found that a rather interesting
                    job.</p>
                <p>When it came time for me to leave, they said they would like me to stay on as a
                    civilian — would I be interested.</p>
                <p>I had fully intended to go back to a teaching career, because that's what I set
                    out to do. Indeed, when I got out, Yale University offered me a teaching
                    position. But it was coming back to Yale at the magnificent salary of something
                    like $2,800. That was worth a lot more in those days, but still it was a very
                    small salary. The Navy offered me practically three times as much.</p>
                <p>We were about to get married, my wife and I, and I thought, gee, I don't know,
                    this is going to be rough trying to go back to a salary like that. On the other
                    hand, I am interested in an academic career, but do I want to make the
                    sacrifice? Also I was enjoying what I was doing. If I hadn't enjoyed was I was
                    doing, it would have made a difference. But I was, so I decided to stay on.</p>
                <p>I stayed on in Naval Intelligence for several years, doing that same kind of
                    general work. I was Chief Coordinating Analyst for the Far East.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because we're concentrating on the foreign affairs side,
                        did you get any feel for how reporting was coming out of embassies as
                        compared to military reporting? How did they compare and contrast?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: This was the end of World War II and right after, the period leading up to
                    the Korean War. We had a heavy military presence in the Far East, in Japan. The
                    Supreme Commander of Allied Powers, General MacArthur, was doing most of the
                    reporting out of Japan. We got a few things eventually.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, from a practical point of view, the Foreign Service
                        straight diplomatic side didn't weigh very heavily at that time in the Far
                        East.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: Not too heavily in the Far East. And then after World War II, you had the
                    Red takeover of China, which was a progressive thing by which the Kuomintang
                    were forced out of China. Again, the military were reporting this for
                    civilians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this must have been your major concentration, wasn't
                        it, what was happening in China at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: At the time, yes. I can distinctly recall keeping a map for the head of
                    ONI, and showing them each day how the situation was changing. The map was
                    getting redder and redder every day, until the whole country was finally
                    red.</p>
                <p>But in Japan, also, you had MacArthur as the dominant influence there, so it was
                    more of a military situation than political.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this from when to when in ONI?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: I was there until the early '50s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think I have you from '46 to '54.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: In early '54 I went to the Office of the Secretary of Defense.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we talk first of the ONI, because later you
                        became involved in the more civilian, State Department side. How did the
                        Korean War hit the Navy, from your particular vantage point, particularly on
                        the intelligence side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: It was mostly an Army operation, so most of the reporting came out of the
                    Army. In ONI we got very little reporting from the Navy. We were concerned more
                    about the Army operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other concerns of the Navy right after the
                        Korean War started? Did you get involved in the Taiwan Straits problem at

                </p>
                <p>WADE: Quemoy and Matsu were much in the news.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting much good information out of China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: Yes, we got pretty good information. I think we felt we knew what was going
                    on. I can't recall now, offhand, when we had to close our embassy in China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think just before the Korean War we were moving out. The
                        last ones were probably out around early 1950. In Shanghai, there was a
                        strained period when we were hanging on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: That's after the Communists had taken over and that operation was finished.
                    Then the Communists went into North Korea and helped the North Koreans. That was
                    our big concern, and whether that would spill over into South Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then I have you from 1954 to 1961.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: I went to the Office of the Secretary of Defense. I was located in what is
                    called International Security Affairs (ISA). They sometimes call it “The Little
                    State Department.” And there I was Director of the Office of National Security
                    Council Affairs.</p>
                <p>The National Security Council (NSC) under the Eisenhower Administration was
                    differently set up than it is today.</p>
                <p>It had, under the Council itself, a Planning Board chaired by the National
                    Security Advisor, who in those days was Bobby Cutler, a Boston fiduciary as he
                    liked to call himself, a Boston banker. He had been president of the big banks
                    in Boston. Ike knew him, and I think liked him, and brought him down to head up
                    this Planning Board.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>This brought together State, Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and CIA.
                    Treasury was brought in later, and the Office of Defense Mobilization (ODM).</p>
                <p>I was the chief liaison between the NSC staff and the Department of Defense. My
                    responsibilities were to go to the Planning Board and back up the Defense
                    member, to be his deputy when he wasn't able to go, and also to be in working
                    groups below that to represent the Department of Defense. Within the Department
                    of Defense my function was to pull together the views of the Department of
                    Defense with respect to National Security Council papers, the views of the
                    Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Navy, the Secretary of the Air
                    Force, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and any relevant parts of the Office of the
                    Secretary of Defense, including ISA, “The Little State Department.” And then to
                    brief the Secretary of Defense once a week.</p>
                <p>We had regular weekly meetings, on Thursday, of the National Security Council
                    under Eisenhower. We briefed the Secretary of Defense the day before for this
                    meeting, which usually had a number of papers we had prepared, wrapped in the
                    working groups in the Planning Board and then gone up. Ike was very set on staff
                    work. He wanted very good staff work coming in. And this was a system that
                    worked perfectly for him, I think. He liked it, and it had many advantages.</p>
                <p>We had, of course, in those days policy disagreements between the Department of
                    Defense and the Department of State. This was inevitable on some of these
                    issues. There would be splits put up to the President on these issues. One side
                    would take one point of view and the other department another. Then the
                    President would decide. These were carefully drafted, so that he could see the
                    differences.</p>
                <p>Ike always wanted the views of the military, independently of anybody else. So
                    the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as a corporate body, would always give their views,
                    through the Secretary of Defense, to the National Security Council. The chairman
                    would attend the meeting also.</p>
                <p>These were circulated to the Department of State and others, so that everybody
                    would know what the military implications were of any given policy.</p>
                <p>This I did for eight years. It was a fascinating job, because it showed me,
                    better than I had ever seen before, how the U.S. Government works at a high
                    level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you think of any issue, or several issues, that caused
                        either a split or about which there was a lot of discussion on policy that
                        helped you figure out how these things worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>WADE: I remember on the overall national security policy, our policy toward the
                    Soviet Union, the Defense Department was always interested in a tougher policy,
                    a more confrontational policy than the State Department was. The State
                    Department was more cautious; they wanted more prudent things. The military were
                    always advocating a slightly stronger position. This was true in other areas,
                    too.</p>
                <p>We used to take up policy papers. I remember we had a policy on Italy, a U.S.
                    policy on Italy. In those days I think Italy may have still been receiving U.S.
                    military assistance from the United States. And here you had a kind of reversal
                    of the roles. The State Department was always very keen on having military
                    assistance go into these countries.</p>
                <p>The Defense Department was less enthusiastic about it. They thought the State
                    Department was using this as a crutch for foreign policy. The Defense argument
                    then was that military assistance should not be used as a crutch for foreign
                    policy, and they thought that the State Department was using it as such.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would this be a crutch?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: That we were propping up a government or ingratiating ourselves with a
                    government by the use of economic and military assistance when the government
                    ought to be getting its own act together, making more of an effort, itself, for
                    example in the military field, and shouldn't be so reliant on U.S. military
                    assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in the decision process, or monitoring
                        the situation in Vietnam just before Dien Bien Phu?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: Yes, yes we were. I remember the decision was very much against doing that.
                    Ike, himself, was very much against getting involved in a land war in Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about in the Department of Defense? Was there any feel
                        for going in there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: Not really any feel for going in there, coming to the aid of the French. It
                    was discussed, but I don't think it was a prolonged discussion because the
                    feeling was not very much for it.</p>
                <p>Another issue that came up at that time, I recall, was that De Gaulle made a
                    pitch to the United States to have a special relationship with the United
                    States, much as the British had. There was some disposition in the United States
                    Government to consider it at least, but it was turned down in the National
                    Security Council. Ike went along with that decision.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>In retrospect you can ask yourself whether it was a wise one or not, whether we
                    might have been able to do more with the French, and keep the French more
                    closely tied to NATO, if we had developed the special relationship. They kind of
                    resented our special relationship with Britain.Those were some of the major
                    things. The Suez crisis...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask about the Suez crisis. This was October
                        '56 or '57. But you had the Hungarian uprising and the Suez crisis. These
                        two, how do they play; how were they seen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: Well, again, in the case of Hungary, the uprising there, there was a little
                    more disposition, I would say, in the Department of Defense to go in and do
                    something about that.</p>
                <p>But the State Department was not anxious at all to get us involved in that. They
                    felt the consequences would be a war with the USSR. And so, finally, it was
                    turned down on that basis. But there was a little more predisposition in Defense
                    to do something about that.</p>
                <p>The Suez crisis was a major event and was embarrassing to the United States, as I
                    recall, because we knew nothing about it. It had been pulled off without our
                    knowledge. There was considerable resentment about that for awhile.</p>
                <p>It affected to a certain extent, I think, our special relationship with the
                    British and the Israelis. And the French, too. We weren't as close to the French
                    ever as the British, but with the French, too.</p>
                <p>These are the kinds of issues that came before the National Security Council. It
                    was a more structured organization, in a way, than we had subsequently.</p>
                <p>When Kennedy came in, he threw the whole system out that I had, and started
                    something new, which had disastrous consequences, at first, with the Bay of
                    Pigs.</p>
                <p>The government wasn't organized to deal with it. I think he later got his act
                    together a little bit. Every President, though, has to use this National
                    Security Council in the way he sees fit.</p>
                <p>One thing that I will say about the Eisenhower use of it, he was the first one to
                    have a National Security Advisor.</p>
                <p>The Council had been set up under Truman, but Jimmy Lay, the Executive Secretary,
                    functioned as the Advisor to the President. He was a high-level civil servant,
                    and Eisenhower thought he wanted his own man in there, somebody of his own
                    political persuasion to help him, so that's why he brought Cutler in.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>The first National Security Advisor, or Advisor to the President for National
                    Security Affairs, as he was called in those days, Bobby Cutler, would never have
                    dreamed of crossing John Foster Dulles in the way that subsequent National
                    Security Advisors have crossed swords with Secretaries of State.</p>
                <p>Great friction has developed that did not exist in those days. In the first
                    place, I don't think John Foster Dulles would ever have allowed it. He would
                    have cut Cutler's head off if he had tried it. But Cutler had the good sense to
                    know that his role was a coordinating one.Ike had the good sense to know that
                    the government had to function in this way, and that you couldn't have this
                    rivalry. If it had started, I'm sure he would have put his foot down on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you also find later Secretaries of Defense (Casper
                        Weinberger's just one example, but there have been others) that almost
                        pursued the wrong foreign policy. Did you have a feeling that there were
                        constraints on the Defense Department to stick to its position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: Yes, I think you're absolutely right on that. The Secretaries of Defense I
                    worked with were Charlie Wilson, very briefly. I came in at the end of his
                    tenure. Then I worked with Neil McElroy and Tom Gates. He was the last one under
                    the Eisenhower Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't have Louis A. Johnson; you were fortunate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: No, no, that was later, the Vietnam era. I had those three. Now the two I
                    knew best were Neil McElroy and Tom Gates. Neither one of them would have
                    dreamed of taking on any of the responsibilities of the Secretary of State, or
                    speaking out openly on subjects which involved the State Department.</p>
                <p>I remember sometimes at lower levels we would stake out positions at variance
                    with State. We would present them to the Secretary, and he would say, “Well, you
                    know, this is really the province of the Department of State, and I don't think
                    I'm going to back you up on this. I'm going to let the State Department have its
                    say.” They would be more inclined to do that. Not that they always did it. They
                    often did take a stand at variance, but not strong stands that involved the
                    political end of things.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You served on both sides in State. The Department of
                        Defense has their “Little State Department,” the ISA, and they've had it for
                        some time. I had never dealt with it, and I remember being asked to do
                        efficiency reports for Foreign Service officers assigned there. I was just
                        flabbergasted to see how big the apparatus was. Now granted, this was in the
                        Reagan Administration, but I would think that having an organization as big
                        as that within the Pentagon dealing with foreign affairs would tend to have
                        its own momentum and its own policy, irrespective of anything else. When you
                        get a bureaucracy, when you have something like that, were you feeling any
                        of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: I was feeling the beginnings of it. The State Department and, indeed, the
                    Joint Chiefs, the Joint Staff, itself, at times would want to express strong
                    political views on things.</p>
                <p>I think it has grown tremendously since that time. It was pretty big even in
                    those days. But now the regions are all represented by a Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary of Defense, and so forth. They weren't in those days. That started to
                    grow under McNamara and Paul Nitze, who came in as Assistant Secretary of
                    Defense for ISA in the Kennedy Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the Kennedy Administration, as you saw it in the
                        Department of Defense? Sometimes when opposing parties come in, there's
                        almost a hostile takeover. How did things work as you saw them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: This was a very hostile takeover, very hostile takeover. I'll tell you
                    something. Eisenhower was a very kind man, I think, and a very trusting man. He
                    wanted to be helpful to the next administration. He was not terribly partisan as
                    you know.</p>
                <p>What he did in his last year in office, and he instructed us in the NSC operation
                    to do, was to revise all the NSC policies, which he considered bipartisan, and
                    get them in good order, up-to-date for the next administration. He thought this
                    was one of the kindest things he could do for any incoming administration,
                    Republican or Democrat.</p>
                <p>So when the Democrats took over, he naturally handed over all of these policies.
                    Well, they couldn't have cared less. They threw out every single policy. They
                    wanted nothing to do with it, absolutely nothing to do with it. All you had to
                    do in the Department of Defense was say something was done under the Eisenhower
                    Administration and they would want to reverse it.</p>
                <p>I left shortly after that to go over to State, because it was a chaotic situation
                    in Defense for a long time, absolutely chaotic.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>They threw out the Planning Board. They threw out the Operations Coordinating
                    Board, which was the operating arm of the government to carry out national
                    security policy, headed up by the Vice President. That all went out, which was
                    all right, because, as I say, every president should be able to use the system
                    in his own way, but they didn't have anything to replace it.</p>
                <p>They were floundering around for a long time. I think this resulted in the Bay of
                    Pigs disaster, because there was no coordinating mechanism in government. And
                    you do have to, in a government as big as ours, with interests as diverse as
                    ours, have something to pull them together.</p>
                <p>They were then pulled together, finally, by McGeorge Bundy in the White House.
                    This tended to increase the power of the Special Assistant for National Security
                    Affairs, or the National Security Advisor as he subsequently became known.</p>
                <p>You had, from that time on, the build-up of the powers of the National Security
                    Advisor, which reached its culmination under Kissinger. He became a focal point,
                    whereas there had been a mechanism before and the power was somewhat
                    disbursed.</p>
                <p>But it was a hostile takeover. I remember it distinctly. The new people came in.
                    They were not disposed to look with favor on anything that had been done
                    previously.</p>
                <p>As I say, all the papers went out. They said, “These are of no concern to us.”
                    They didn't want to even look at them. They wanted to start afresh. So all that
                    work, really, it was almost a year's worth revising all those papers, was kind
                    of wasted effort. And Ike was very insistent on good staff work. He wanted
                    everything in good, apple-pie order.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's sad, isn't it. One looks at this over the period of
                        years, a time that is wasted in massaging egos so that they can each feel as
                        though they have created something and owe nothing. We are talking about the
                        work of professional staffs who are going to look at the same problems. The
                        problems don't change, and the answers often don't change that much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: That was, of course, the chaos that reigned. There was real chaos in the
                    government, at least in the Defense Department during that first year of the
                    Kennedy Administration.</p>
                <p>That's when I went over to State. I was really very happy that an opportunity
                    arose to go over there, because it was much more orderly in State. I didn't feel
                    the confusion that there was in Defense. I'm sure Defense ultimately got
                    straightened out, but you had a very strong ego heading up the Department of
                    Defense.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WADE: Robert McNamara. He did not hesitate to assert himself on any issue and had
                    his own ideas as to what he wanted done.</p>
                <p>There was also great tension between this new crew coming in and the professional
                    military. The military did not like the new team. They let it be shown on many
                    occasions. This was unfortunate, too.</p>
                <p>I don't think McNamara ever did win over the trust of the military. They had to
                    go along with him on certain things. He brought back Max Taylor to help him.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WADE: He was more in tune with McNamara than some of the other military leaders,
                    but the others had a rough time at first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this switch come over? You went over to...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: Then the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, CU as it was called in
                    those days, the functions of which have since been transferred to USIA. That was
                    a very large bureau, the only operating bureau in the State Department at that
                    time. Do you remember it at all?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes, I remember CU very well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: I went over to head up their Multilateral Educational Affairs. One of my
                    chief responsibilities was UNESCO, because that was the multilateral educational
                    organization that was the most important in those days, and still is.</p>
                <p>But, of course, there were educational activities under the OAS and various other
                    organizations, which we watched, too. I had other responsibilities, but my chief
                    one really was the backstopping in the bureau of UNESCO.</p>
                <p>I served in that job about a year and a half or two years, during which I used to
                    go over to UNESCO to attend Executive Board meetings. This is how I became
                    immersed in UNESCO affairs.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>I would spend a couple of months of the year over there attending Planning Board
                    meetings or meetings of the General Conference. I got to know the workings of
                    the organization, the working of the mission.</p>
                <p>Then an opening occurred in 1964 for me to go over there myself. I was asked to
                    go over to replace the Permanent Representative, who was a political appointee.
                    There had been two political appointees in a row, both serving 18 months. The
                    mission was in terrible shape.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get to that, I wonder if we could go back to
                        talk a little about when you were in CU. What were our main interests, say
                        with UNESCO. We're talking about the 1961-64 period. How do we view UNESCO,
                        particularly your area? What were our concerns with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: The '60s were what some people have called “The Golden Era of UNESCO.” It
                    was in its heyday then. It was doing useful work, and we viewed it rather
                    positively.We had a large national commission, U.S. National Commission for
                    UNESCO. It was also one of my responsibilities in the department to try to
                    service this, and to supervise the staff that serviced it.</p>
                <p>That commission was set up by Act of Congress, back in the days when UNESCO was
                    started, and had a hundred somewhat powerful citizens on it in the fields of
                    Education, Science, Culture, Mass Communications, and Social Science.</p>
                <p>They were all enthusiastic supporters of UNESCO, because UNESCO was engaged in
                    those days in quite useful work. So I would say that our attitude toward UNESCO
                    in the department, and the government generally, was quite positive.</p>
                <p>There were things about the organization that we obviously didn't like. There
                    were problems, but these were minor compared to the problems that we later
                    encountered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Later it became almost a swear word.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: That's right. The organization went out of control. It was a bad word. It
                    still is to a certain extent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went there in 1964. You were saying that things
                        were in pretty bad shape.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: Well, yes. I was perfectly content with my job in the department and going
                    over there occasionally. But the Planning Board member for the United States at
                    that time was one William Benton, who had been an Assistant Secretary of State
                    and one of the founders of UNESCO. Do you remember Bill Benton? He was Assistant
                    Secretary of State for Public Affairs.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think so. Was he of Benton and Bowles?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: He was the Benton of Benton and Bowles. That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a major advertising agency.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: And then he was later publisher of The Encyclopedia Britannica, which he
                    owned. He had gone back to UNESCO. He was asked by Johnson to go back and be the
                    Planning Board member after all these years of absence.</p>
                <p>I still recall when he went back, he said he felt like Thomas Jefferson walking
                    through the walls of the Pentagon (as Thomas Jefferson would if he had come back
                    to Washington and tried to walk through the walls of the Pentagon). UNESCO was
                    such a different organization. He had seen it at its very inception in London in
                    1945, I guess it was. He was quite a vigorous guy, and he was not satisfied with
                    out mission over there. He had some political clout, too, because he was a very
                    wealthy man and a contributor to the presidential campaign.</p>
                <p>I did not know this until later, but he went in and raised hell with Kennedy
                    about the state of our mission over there. He had contributed to Kennedy's
                    campaign, so he could do this. He said, “I'm not satisfied.” And Kennedy said,
                    “Yes but he's a political appointee, and the incumbent has given money. I don't
                    know that I can do this. I don't know that I can remove him.”</p>
                <p>During the conversation, Benton told me, the President set out and asked how much
                    Crane Houseman had given to the campaign. And they looked it up and came back
                    and said $75,000, which in those days was a pretty sizable contribution. So,
                    Kennedy was reluctant to remove him for that reason. I don't know what Benton
                    had contributed, maybe more, but he got his way. He had him removed. He thought
                    he was totally incompetent. He told Kennedy this. He said, “He's totally
                    incompetent.”</p>
                <p>So then they wanted some professional to go over and pick up the pieces, and try
                    to put the mission back together.</p>
                <p>In the department we sometimes wouldn't hear from the mission for weeks on end.
                    We didn't know what was going on. They turned to me, as the professional of the
                    department, and said, “Why don't you go over and pick up the pieces.” To tell
                    you the truth, I was not particularly anxious to do this. I knew the job would
                    be to put it back together. I had just gotten everything organized in the
                    department. I was happy with the operation here. My wife was doing interior
                    decorating at the time, and she had her own little business</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>[TAPE ONE, SIDE B INAUDIBLE FOR BRIEF TIME]</p>
                <p>WADE: I was going to tell you about Abu Simbel. UNESCO got this operation going
                    with a plan to cut up the temple into a thousand pieces and relocate it several
                    hundred feet higher. I had the privilege of seeing this temple when it was cut
                    in the thousand pieces lying on the ground before the waters [of the reservoir
                    behind Egypt's Aswan High Dam] had risen. I thought, my golly, will they ever
                    get that thing together again? Well, they did, and I went back for the
                    dedication ceremonies.</p>
                <p>Luke Battle, with whom I was associated in CU, had been the Ambassador to Egypt,
                    and he came back for the dedication. He and I went down to represent the United
                    States at the ceremony for the dedication of Abu Simbel. It was magnificent to
                    see this thing put back together on high ground.</p>
                <p>An Egyptologist with the Louvre, who was there, told me that he could not see
                    that that thing had ever been disturbed. He said, “It looks exactly the same.”
                    One of the remarkable things about it was that the seaming of the stones was
                    done by unskilled, Nubian workers, whom they had taught how to do this. And it
                    was done so beautifully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Their ancestors had probably put it together in the
                        beginning.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: That's a good point. That may have been the reason.</p>
                <p>Anyway, this is an example of the type of thing that UNESCO can do well. They
                    later saw Philae, another temple, restored. Some of the other temples along the
                    Nile were saved also.</p>
                <p>Angkor Wat [ancient Khmer temple in Cambodia], UNESCO has been instrumental in
                    helping to restore. This is the kind of thing they can do well in the cultural
                    field, as well as bring ministers of culture from all over the world together to
                    discuss cultural matters.There are five disciplines: Education, Science,
                    Culture, Mass Communications, and Social Science.</p>
                <p>Mass communications they got into because UNESCO from the beginning was committed
                    to the free flow of information. That was one of the things that people like
                    Bill Benton, who was there at the founding, insisted on, and Archibald MacLeish,
                    who was there, insisted on and got written into the constitution.</p>
                <p>As a result of this, you got a Department of Mass Communications. This was fine,
                    and it has done some useful work. But in later days, and there was just a
                    rumbling of this when I was there, they got into the idea of state control of
                    information.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's been the most controversial part of the whole
                        UNESCO.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: That's right. This was a disaster as far as the United States was
                    concerned. There was just a faint rumbling of this while I was there. But it
                    wasn't a serious problem.</p>
                <p>While I was there, the Director General was Rene Mailleux, a French intellectual
                    who was also a very good administrator. He brought unusual talent to the
                    organization and was a very, very able man. He would not allow the thing to get
                    perverted. He had his critics, too, in this country. But, by and large, he had a
                    lot of support. He would not allow the organization to become perverted in the
                    way that it did later on.</p>
                <p>There is that potential for perversion with the communications field. Similarly,
                    social science. They got into social science because it was considered an
                    offshoot of the science field. If you were in natural sciences, you ought to be
                    in the social sciences, too. So this came along.</p>
                <p>Every country has its own idea about social science problems. And there's not the
                    unanimity of opinion on them that there is in other areas. It has been a
                    troublesome area for the United States on many occasions.</p>
                <p>UNESCO, because of its constitution, which starts out: “Since wars begin in the
                    minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must be
                    constructed...”, felt that this statement gave them some license to go fishing
                    in the peace field. This is very attractive to an international organization,
                    because if you get into this area, which has all sorts of political overtones
                    and mission, you enhance your prestige.</p>
                <p>We kept pointing out that this was the province of the United Nations, itself,
                    and that we would be trespassing if we got there. Nevertheless, UNESCO got
                    itself involved, even while I was there, in peace research, arms control and
                    disarmament studies, the economic consequences of disarmament.</p>
                <p>Some of these things were semi-legitimate, like the economic consequences of
                    disarmament, but it would have been wiser to leave it all to the United Nations
                    and stay out of the field. But they got into it.</p>
                <p>This tended to be a controversial area, particularly between the Soviet Union and
                    us, in UNESCO. The Soviets were always pushing this, thinking they could make
                    political capital. We were getting involved in the Vietnam War while I was
                    there, too, and the Soviets thought they could make propaganda out of our
                    involvement by pushing peace research and disarmament.</p>
                <p>Those are the areas in which UNESCO was operating when I was there and, as I say,
                    in most of them doing credible work.</p>

                        Union was a member. Were they serious about the goals, or were they using
                        this purely as a tool for a purpose other than the stated purposes of
                        UNESCO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: I think both were true. I think they were serious to a certain extent for
                    what they could get out of the organization, and they had certain things that
                    they were interested in.</p>
                <p>Their scientists were genuinely interested in this. They brought their astronauts
                    [Cosmonauts] to UNESCO to show them off. They were very proud of their
                    accomplishments. We brought ours later, too.</p>
                <p>They had some legitimate goals and interests, but they also used it for
                    propaganda purposes. They also, I knew, had KGB agents on the staff of the
                    mission and were using it for activities other than what was ostensibly the
                    purpose of the organization.</p>
                <p>Our relations with the Soviet Union were very strained. This was the height of
                    the Cold War. I know the Soviet Permanent Representative used to come to me and
                    say, “There's only one issue on which I can really cooperate with you, and
                    that's the budget.” And that was true. They were against increases in the budget
                    for much the same reason we were. But otherwise there was very little that we
                    could agree on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about relations with the State Department. That is
                        always important to any mission abroad. How did you deal with them? You'd
                        come from the office, but were you getting what you wanted out of the State
                        Department? Was there interest in what you were doing, or was it sort of
                        grudging?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: There was interest in CU in what we were doing, because that was the Bureau
                    of Educational and Cultural Affairs. There was perhaps less interest in IO, (the
                    International Organization that deals with the United Nations and the
                    specialized agencies), less interest because they had certain
                    responsibilities.</p>
                <p>I worked for both bureaus in the field. CU had the substantive interest. IO had
                    the budget and political interest.</p>
                <p>IO had perhaps less interest in the substance, much less interest in the
                    substance. And they felt that some of the political issues in UNESCO were
                    annoying. But they supported it, except that they were dead set against these
                    budget increases. And this always caused problems.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>On the other hand, the National Commission for UNESCO, which is this private
                    group of a hundred citizens, a pressure group, always felt the budget was
                    grossly insufficient and should have been increased. But they didn't have the
                    responsibility for coming up with the money. The IO did — for getting it out of
                    the Congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself getting instructions from Washington
                        about doing things you thought were more of a political nature rather than
                        going along? Say, today we're pushing support for Vietnam — so do something
                        here. I mean was Vietnam an inhibitor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: Vietnam was a great inhibitor. But it was a subject that we left untouched
                    to the extent we could, because the moment you raised it, you got an awful lot
                    of flak, either at a General Conference, at an Executive Board meeting, or even
                    at a committee meeting of UNESCO. It was a subject you didn't bring up. The
                    department never instructed me to bring it up at any point. They knew the wisdom
                    of keeping quiet about it in an international organization.</p>
                <p>Now it did come up, because others would raise it. In the Executive Board meeting
                    I would have to ask for right-of-reply to defend our position. In the General
                    Conference it would come up. There was strong feeling in the world against that
                    war, you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. How about the other bone of contention in multinational
                        things, our support of Israel. Was this a problem for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: There were at times attempts, as in the United Nations, to brand Israel as
                    an aggressor or to pass resolutions which were inimical to Israel. We always
                    were able to get those defeated, or get those stopped before they got out on the
                    table.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, while I was there, the Israelis were not cooperating with us in
                    UNESCO to the extent to which they should. After all, we were their biggest
                    supporters. They should, I think, have given more support. They would never vote
                    with us, for example, on the budget or things like that. They gave us support
                    when they wanted to, and when they didn't, they didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you didn't feel that we were able to use what amounted
                        to tremendous clout with the Israelis. I mean, after all, we were supporting
                        them. Without the United States, Israel probably wouldn't exist. But we
                        weren't using that to make them vote with us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: We didn't use it, in retrospect, maybe as much as we should have. The
                    pressure for that would have had to come from Washington. For reasons I'm not
                    familiar with, they didn't choose to exercise it to the extent they might
                    have.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Congress. Did you have any problems with members
                        of Congress coming over, or Congress as a group passing resolutions giving
                        any problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: No, we had very good support from Congress. We used to get congressional
                    visits. I recall Bob McClury, who was a congressman at that time, used to come
                    over periodically on some educational meetings of the universal body of
                    legislators. I forget what they call that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: International Parliamentary Union.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: That's right, IPU. He used to come over on that to educational meetings. He
                    was chairman for a number of years of the Educational Committee. He was always
                    very interested in the work that UNESCO was then doing, and was very supportive
                    of our work.</p>
                <p>We used to have congressional delegations also come over for the general
                    conferences, which were held every two years. I recall Chuck Percy came over on
                    one of those.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was Senator from Illinois.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: He was Senator from Illinois at that time. He came over as head of the
                    congressional delegation and was appalled at what he thought was a very
                    niggardly stance that we were taking on the budget. He thought we were not being
                    forthcoming enough at all. He was very critical of our position.</p>
                <p>I remember his saying to me, “Do you mind if I get on the phone and talk to the
                    White House about this?” I said, “Well, I don't think it's going to do any good,
                    but please feel free. I'd be delighted if we could get them to change their view
                    on it.” Well, he got on the phone and had it changed. He got our instructions
                    changed, which shows the good that can come sometimes of a congressional
                    delegation if you get them working for you.</p>
                <p>So we had pretty good working relations with these delegations. They were
                    helpful, that's what I'm trying to say, I think, they were helpful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about UNESCO and the United Nations. What was the
                        relationship in a general body? How did that work as you saw it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>WADE: It's one of the specialized agencies of the United Nations, along with FAO,
                    NCAO in Montreal, IAEA in Vienna, the ILO in Geneva, and the WHO, World Health
                    Organization. These are all specialized agencies of the U.N. They work with the
                    U.N., but the U.N. doesn't really exercise any formal control over them. They're
                    pretty much independent, but they're all kind of satellites.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Satellites, but they didn't look towards the United
                        Nations as an organization. They operated on their own?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: They operated almost entirely on their own. There was a meeting once or
                    twice a year, under U.N. auspices of the Directors General of these specialized
                    agencies. They got together with the Secretary General of the United Nations and
                    discussed problems, common problems. That's as far as it went. But anything in
                    the way of supervision, no. Submitted reports, yes, to the U.N., but it was
                    perfunctory. They were satellites and pretty independent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left UNESCO in 1969. Was this because of a change in
                        administration? The Nixon Administration came in and they put somebody else
                        in?.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: Well, I had been there five years. I had the longest tenure of any United
                    States Permanent Representative to UNESCO, before or since. So I had already
                    overstayed my — I hope not overstayed my welcome — but I had perhaps overstayed
                    a bit. I should have left perhaps after four years, but I stayed five. And then
                    when Nixon came in, I was offered a presidential appointment as Assistant
                    Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How come? I mean, here you are dealing with education and
                        other things of this nature. All of a sudden you're in arms control.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: That's a good question. I was asked that same question at my confirmation
                    hearing by Senator Sparkman. The only thing I could think of was to quote that
                    sentence at the beginning of the constitution of UNESCO: “Since wars begin in
                    the minds of men...the defense of peace must be constructed.”</p>
                <p>UNESCO, as I told you, had been in arms control, disarmament studies, and things
                    of that sort. So it wasn't as much of a leap into the unknown as it might have
                    been. Also I had this defense background in national security affairs.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>I had known Gerry Smith (Girard C. Smith), who was then Director of the Arms
                    Control and Disarmament Agency. I had known him in the Eisenhower Administration
                    when he was Assistant Secretary of State for Policy Planning. We had worked
                    together to a certain extent then. There was this opening on his staff.</p>
                <p>I happened to know some people in White House personnel office. This was not
                    something I initiated myself. As a matter of fact, I was perfectly happy in
                    Paris. I think I would have stayed there another year or so if nothing had
                    happened.</p>
                <p>I got this call saying would you be interested in talking with Gerry Smith; he
                    would like to talk to you about this job. So I came back and talked to him about
                    it. Since it was a presidential appointment, I accepted it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: It was Assistant Director of what was called the Economics Bureau. And I
                    said to Gerry, “You know I'm not an economist.” He said, “Well, I don't want an
                    economist, I want somebody who can manage economists.”</p>
                <p>It also had the social sciences in it, too, studies, arms trade, and things like
                    that. It was a kind of catch-all bureau.</p>
                <p>We did studies on the economic consequences of disarmament. A lot those had been
                    done. You see, the Act of the ACDA, Arms Control and Disarmament Agency,
                    stipulated that there should be established in the agency a general fund of
                    knowledge. That's very broad, but it gave the Congress and the Administration an
                    opportunity to do a heck of a lot of studies that had never been done before,
                    some of which were useful, some less useful.</p>
                <p>Hubert Humphrey, I think, was the one who was responsible for that idea, setting
                    up this general fund of knowledge. It's a good idea if you watch it carefully.
                    When I came in, though, I found that we were doing all sorts of studies and
                    contracting for all sorts of works: books on the Soviet Union, books on
                    Communist China, and so forth, only a small part of which had really anything to
                    do with arms control.</p>
                <p>We also had a dissertation support program and were giving money to students to
                    write dissertations on arms control subjects. When I looked into some of the
                    things that were being done, I was kind of appalled.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>One of these studies, a Ph.D. dissertation, had to do with the study of rats, and
                    how by injecting them you could create killer rats and tame rats. I don't know
                    whether this was supposed to have some significance for mankind or not, but
                    anyway I could see that this sort of thing was going to give us trouble on the
                    Hill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That sounds like injecting people to make them more
                        tranquil or something like that, wow!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: And it almost did get us into trouble. I know I had to go up and testify on
                    the budget with Gerry. An article in Time Magazine talked about this research,
                    and they mentioned that it was funded by the Arms Control and Disarmament
                    Agency. And Rooney, you remember Congressman Rooney?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes, John Rooney of Brooklyn.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: He was conducting the hearings, and I thought, “Oh boy, am I ever in for
                    trouble!” On the way up, Gerry said, “If we get into that rat research, you will
                    have to answer it, because I don't know anything about it.”</p>
                <p>I didn't really have a good defense on it because it shouldn't have been done. We
                    were trying to exercise restraint in the agency, I guess. It had been approved
                    before I got there, and the thought was you don't interfere in academic
                    studies.</p>
                <p>But anyway, fortunately, Rooney did not bring that up. He must not have seen it,
                    his staff must have missed it, and I was very surprised.</p>
                <p>Instead, he got onto something entirely different and spent the hearing on the
                    fact that the Assistant Directors had TV sets in their offices. He had just
                    learned this, and he was furious about it.</p>
                <p>Gerry said, “Well, all the Assistant Secretaries of State have TV sets in their
                    offices. Our Assistant Directors are supposed to be on the same level as
                    Assistant Secretaries of State, so what's the difference, why can't we?”</p>
                <p>Rooney said, “That is not true. They do not have them.” He turned to a member of
                    his staff and said, “Go out and call the Secretary of State's office and ask
                    them whether the Assistant Secretaries of State have TVs in their offices.” We
                    knew all of them did.</p>
                <p>The answer came back during the hearing: “No there aren't any.” So Rooney said,
                    “See, I was right.” And so he said to Gerry, “You get rid of those TVs.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>I don't know what happened to the TVs, but they had to go out. But he spent the
                    whole hearing on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was the type of thing that you would get into,
                        which in many ways was fortunate. I mean, you know, big deal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: But he missed some of the bigger things because of that. Anyway, one of my
                    jobs was (and Gerry was very interested in getting this done, too) to review
                    this and see what was legitimate and what wasn't.</p>
                <p>We cut out a lot of that research. In the first place, a lot had been done.
                    Secondly, we had rather high-priced help in the department — GS-17s supervising
                    contracts for this. They weren't doing anything substantive, themselves, they
                    were just supervising contracts. As a result, we finally made a cut in staff and
                    got rid of some of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After that, what was the main focus of what you were
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: We brought out a publication, which involved a major effort of the bureau,
                    on world military expenditures. You may have seen it over the years. It's still
                    brought out, I think, by the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, periodically.
                    We used to do it every year.</p>
                <p>The Defense Department never liked it. And I can see why. It was comparing apples
                    and oranges, in a way. It was the opportunity costs that were missed by building
                    certain things. In other words, if you didn't build a bomber, you could
                    construct two hospitals, that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>But we did assess, keep track of, world military expenditures. And we estimated,
                    along with CIA, the Soviet military expenditures and tried to get a picture of
                    military expenditures throughout the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel you were getting fairly good information from
                        the Central Intelligence Agency?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: Yes, I think they did the best they could. It was a hard job, because the
                    Soviets released practically nothing in those days on their military budget. We
                    did know what they had, and then we had to try to estimate what that would cost
                    in the Soviet Union. It was a very approximate figure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you trying to, I won't say skew it, but if you had
                        two figures, would you take the higher figure?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>WADE: No, we really tried to put it down as we saw it, to try to get it as
                    accurate as possible. We didn't have to skew it because their expenditures were
                    very high, and still are, as a matter of fact.</p>
                <p>Despite all the things that have happened, I think Judge Webster said this
                    yesterday, the world situation has changed tremendously, but their expenditures
                    on military haven't come down all that much. They will, I think, but they
                    haven't yet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Judge Webster is the head of the CIA. What was our view,
                        as you saw it? How did you see the Soviets, the people around you, at that
                        time? We're speaking of the '69 to '73 period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: Well, it was then still “The Evil Empire,” I guess. They had, you see,
                    caught up by that time and were militarily just about equal with us in the
                    strategic field. They had overwhelming conventional superiority, which gave us
                    great pause.</p>
                <p>We weren't so concerned about that earlier on when we had superiority in the
                    nuclear field, because we felt that they couldn't move in the conventional field
                    with impunity knowing that we could knock them out very easily with our
                    strategic weapons.</p>
                <p>All this changed when they reached superiority. Then it became more imperative
                    than ever to get some kind of arms control agreement.</p>
                <p>The SALT I was the first such serious effort that we had. Even in those days,
                    though, I think it was recognized that something had to be done about the
                    conventional forces. But it wasn't until much later that we got really going on
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how about one of the pet things of the Department of
                        Defense, and actually the State Department is often a willing cosponsor of
                        arms sales. I mean we use arms sales for all sorts of reasons. Obviously,
                        here in an arms control agency there's no point in selling fancy tanks to
                        Peru. But maybe the Peruvian military likes it. What sort of role would you
                        all play?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: I had in my bureau a unit that dealt exclusively with arms control, arms
                    transfers. It reviewed every one of these.</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact, there was agreement in the government that the arms control
                    agency would give its views on these arms transfers. But we weren't very
                    successful with it.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>We did make our views known. We were opposed to the kind of thing that you just
                    mentioned, and would make the case as strongly as we could. But we were almost
                    always overruled for political reasons. The comeback always was: Well, there are
                    overriding political reasons why we have to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How often this has been used for whatever it is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: So I can't say that we had any great success. We tried, and you're
                    absolutely right, it should be one of the purposes of an arms control agency to
                    try to control that. As I say, we did our best, but I don't think we had much
                    success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Girard Smith's operating style?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: He is a very clever negotiator. I always said you could never give Gerry
                    Smith a wooden nickel — he'd never accept it. I think he was a very able
                    negotiator. He was the negotiator on SALT I, the sole negotiator. He had a team
                    with him, but he was the chief negotiator.</p>
                <p>He's detailed all this in his book Double Talk. He was absolutely right for the
                    job at that time. He was tough with the Soviets, and yet he knew how to work
                    with them well enough to get an agreement. I think he was undercut in much of
                    what he was doing by Kissinger, as he details in the book. Kissinger, you know,
                    was conducting back-burner negotiations with the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I've come across this also in talking to George West,
                        who was carrying on what turned out to be the Helsinki Accords. Kissinger,
                        who was at that time National Security Advisor, was telling the Soviet
                        Ambassador: Well we really don't care about that. There was a lot of this
                        going on. WADE: There was a lot of it going on, and the unfortunate thing
                        was that Gerry Smith was never informed of what was taking place. Whereas
                        Semyonov, the Soviet representative in Vienna and Helsinki where the talks
                        were held, was always informed of what was going on. It put our man at a
                        distinct disadvantage, and that was very unfortunate. That should really
                        have never happened.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Trying to get this picture, you have the head of the NSC,
                        National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger, who, at the time, was from your
                        vantage point not playing a healthy role.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: Less than helpful. I was not particularly involved in the SALT negotiations
                    in my bureau. But I know from what went on, from reading Gerry's book and
                    talking to him, also, that he had problems with Kissinger.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it that you had some hostile forces around you. One
                        was the NSC, which had a SALT agenda. The other one was the Department of
                        Defense, which didn't want you to mess around with their selling of arms
                        because there's the profit. You get rid of your old tanks so you can buy
                        some new tanks. And then actually the State Department, which had all those
                        overwhelming political reasons for doing something. You must have felt
                        somewhat isolated, didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: That's true, although we were[n't?] located in the Department of State, you
                    knew and felt a closeness with State. They weren't always supportive, but they
                    were more supportive than anybody else. I will say this, they were more
                    supportive than the NSC or certainly the Department of Defense in those
                    days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you retired, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: Yes, '73.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Department of State at the
                        time you retired? Did you think it was an effective instrument,
                        non-effective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: Oh, I think it was then a very effective instrument of foreign policy.
                    Organizations always have their problems, but I think it was doing very well. So
                    well, that I was an advocate at the time of incorporating the Arms Control and
                    Disarmament Agency into the Department of State. I still feel that would be a
                    good thing. They have to work hand in glove. I don't think it should be a
                    separate agency.</p>
                <p>I had very positive feelings about the Department of State. I have a very high
                    regard for all the Foreign Service officers with whom I served, most of them,
                    not all of them. I think they've done a great job. I think the department does a
                    great job.</p>
                <p>The department has had a real problem, though, as I see it from my vantage point
                    over the years. First, you had the International Security Affairs, “The Little
                    State Department,” in the Pentagon. Then you had this enormous growth in power
                    and prestige of the NSC staff, something that didn't exist when I was associated
                    with the NSC, but which I've seen grow and grow and grow. And you've had this
                    conflict in successive administrations between the National Security Advisor and
                    the Secretary of State, both Republicans.</p>
                <p>This is the first time, the Bush Administration, that I can recall that we have
                    had a really harmonious relationship between the NSC staff and the Secretary of
                    State. No conflict whatsoever.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>I think that's a tribute to both Brent Scowcroft and Jim Baker. I think Scowcroft
                    knows that it would be futile for him to try to get into a hassle with Baker. I
                    think he knows that Baker is very close to the President, and realizes also that
                    State should be supreme.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're back to the Dulles/Eisenhower, Acheson/Truman
                        relationship. Two very close, compatible people. That's when it works.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: Yes, and you couldn't possibly have a third person coming between and
                    trying to steal the power. It certainly has been a problem in the intervening
                    administrations. A terrible problem.</p>
                <p>I'm glad to see this development. I think it strengthens the hand of the
                    department, because you don't have this other power center over there working at
                    odds with the department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also with the Department of Defense, because there is
                        this temptation for the Department of Defense to start running with foreign
                        policy matters, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: That's right. I don't think you're going to see that with Cheney, either.
                    Cheney has the advantage of having worked in the White House as Chief of Staff
                    to President Ford. He knows how things should operate, and knows that Defense
                    shouldn't be meddling too much in these affairs where they have no business.</p>
                <p>Defense has a legitimate interest in many, many things, but they shouldn't be
                    overstepping and trying to get into the political area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Casper Weinberger, who was Secretary of Defense
                        for a long time, really wanted to be Secretary of State. I want to thank you
                        very much. I've enjoyed this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WADE: Well, I have, too. It's been a pleasure.</p>
