                <p>AMBASSADOR DONALD PETTERSON</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy and Lambert Heyniger</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: December 13, 1996</p>
                <p>Copyright 2002 ADST</p>
                <p>Q: Today is December 13, 1996. This is an interview with Donald Petterson. We're
                    doing this on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training and
                    I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy.</p>
                <p>All right. Well, can we start at the beginning? Could you tell mwhen and where
                    you were born and something about your family?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I was born in Huntington Park, California, November 17, 1930, during
                    the Great Depression. Like so many then, my father was without a job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: We moved around southern California until I was three, my dad finally
                    getting work here and there. We moved to Pismo Beach, California when I was
                    three, and he-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's up in northern, mid California?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: It's central coast-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Central coast, oh?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Roughly halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles, ninety miles or
                    so north of Santa Barbara. My mother worked with my father in the Safeway store
                    in Pismo. She later became a librarian. My dad stayed with Safeway until he
                    retired about 30 years later. So I grew up in this small beach town, a tourist
                    town, in California in the '30s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that near Cambria Pines?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: About 40 miles south of Cambria.</p>
                <p>My two brothers and I had an idyllic kind of childhood there in that small town,
                    free to roam the beach, free to roam the hills behind the town. We moved twelve
                    miles north to San Luis Obispo when my father was transferred during the war. I
                    was thirteen at the time and went through high school there before joining the
                    navy in 1948.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the high school, did you get any particular feeling
                        abouforeign affairs or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: None whatsoever. I was primarily interested in sports when I was in
                    high school. I was a good enough student, at least until I got to be a
                    tempestuous teenager and lost interest in academics.</p>
                <p>The rock of stability of my adolescence was athletics. I was not a particularly
                    good athlete, but I worked hard at it and lettered in a varsity sport. I was the
                    first-string catcher on the baseball team. I admired one of my coaches very
                    much, and I thought that coaching was what I wanted to do with my life. But I
                    wasn't ready for college, and I knew it, so I joined the navy.</p>
                <p>I told my dad, “Look, I've never been out of California. I've never even been to
                    Los Angeles except one brief visit and I want to see the world. Please would you
                    sign for me?” I was only seventeen. My mother and father agreed. I ate bananas
                    all that summer trying to gain enough weight to pass the physical exam. I was
                    worried the navy might not take me. But in 1948 the Berlin Crisis was on, the
                    services were expanding, and they would take anything that breathed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: My only deficiency was my scrawniness, and [laughter] I wasn't that
                    scrawny! So I was accepted in the navy, took a train to Los Angeles, had a final
                    physical exam, and joined other recruits there for a train ride down to San
                    Diego, to boot camp. I had my hair shaved off and got some uniforms. That first
                    night (I thought this was rather strange) they had some of us stand what they
                    called a fire watch. I wondered, “Why do we have to do this? Why can't we just
                    go to bed?” [Laughter].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: The next morning, my first breakfast in the navy was baked beans,
                    which I hated. And I thought, “Perhaps I've made a mistake!” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: But it was too late. I survived boot camp as most young men did, young
                    men and women now, of course. I decided that I wanted to go into submarines, but
                    I had signed up for the aviation branch, and the navy held me to my contract. I
                    was sent Airman's Fundamentals School at Naval Air Station Millington,
                    Tennessee, near Memphis. I went to Memphis by train in a Pullman car.</p>
                <p>Q: It got you out of California!PETTERSON: It got me out of California. Marvelous
                    trip! Crossing the United States in November, going over the Rockies, seeing
                    snow falling for the first time in my life, watching the wonderful countryside
                    pass by - that was the positive side of it.</p>
                <p>The negative side was that the two petty officers who accompanied these boots
                    cleaned us out good in poker and blackjack games [Laughter]. But when we got to
                    Memphis, I didn't need much money anyway, for I was going into training. With
                    hundreds of others, I had to wait for about three months until there was room in
                    the classes, which were overcrowded because the navy had suddenly expanded
                    without sufficient facilities to accommodate all the people who were coming in.
                    While we were waiting, we had to do various kinds of menial labor, some of them
                    make-work. I soon became very adept in the art of goldbricking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Airman's Fundamentals was a mixture of mathematics, physics, and brief
                    courses in the various specialties, such as metal working, aviation ordinance,
                    mechanics, parachute rigging, and aerology, the navy's term for meteorology. I
                    did very well academically in the tests and was able to choose the field I
                    wanted. I chose aerology, and was sent to Lakehurst, New Jersey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The old balloon, I mean, Lighter-Than-Air facilities.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, up in the Pinelands of New Jersey. It was a nice setting.
                    Parachute rigger trainees were also at Lakehurst. I joined a class of about
                    forty budding meteorologists. The course lasted fourteen weeks, at the end of
                    which we could choose from the available billets. We selected on the basis of
                    our test scores. I managed to be number one in the class, so I had first pick.
                    There were only two seagoing billets, and I had no intention of going to a shore
                    station if I could avoid it. I took one of the two, both of which were on
                    transports. I chose the USS General William Mitchell, named after the
                    controversial army air force general. I took my first transcontinental air
                    flight on a DC-3, which lumbered across the United States to Burbank. From there
                    I made my way to San Diego to catch a ship to San Francisco, where the Mitchell
                    was berthed. So I got my first brief sea duty on an oiler, which took a couple
                    days to get up to San Francisco. I spent the daylight hours out on the deck
                    chipping paint, the marvelous pastime [laughter] that the navy equivalent of
                    grunts have to perform to keep the ships from rusting. I found that I didn't get
                    seasick. I got a little queasy the first night out, went to my bunk, got up the
                    next day, felt fine, and was never seasick in my years of sea duty. I went to
                    San Francisco, boarded the Mitchell, and off to the Far East we went.</p>
                <p>Q: Just out of curiosity, why would there be meteorologists on transports? I
                    would think it would be aircraft carriers or something like that.</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, meteorologists - aerographers - were on carriers and ships of the
                    line. Especially on carriers, which would have a detachment of aerographers.
                    Good question. I honestly don't know, but the larger transports, like the
                    Mitchell, had one aerographer aboard who provided the captain with information
                    about the weather. Perhaps it was because of the precious cargo, people.</p>
                <p>At any rate, I was now a crewman on the Mitchell. My predecessor, a petty
                    officer, stayed aboard the ship for my first cruise, out to the Far East and
                    back. I learned some of the ropes from him and was available for other duties in
                    the “O” (Operations) division, including chipping and painting and that sort of
                    thing. My predecessor, the petty officer, didn't have to do any of that scut
                    work because he had his meteorological responsibilities, including providing the
                    captain with forecasts.</p>
                <p>We went to Hawaii, to Guam, west to the Philippines, up to Japan, and then
                    returned to the States for a couple of months. Then we picked up passengers and
                    went back on a similar trip. Beginning with that trip, I was the lone
                    aerographer's mate and was relieved of other duties, which made me happy.</p>
                <p>I never really liked the navy as such. There was a lot of, to me, pettiness in
                    the way people were handled by some of their supervisors. I realized there was a
                    need for discipline and structure, but I thought that there was a lot of
                    unfairness and unnecessary pettiness about it at times.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>However, I loved the sea and visiting foreign ports. I retain vivid memories of
                    my first voyages on the Mitchell: the sight of a land mass looming up on the
                    horizon as darkness gave way to dawn; the ships that were sunk during World War
                    II still clogging Manila Bay; the beauty of the Filipina mestizas promenading in
                    downtown Manila; in Yokosuka and Tokyo the teeming streets, market stalls,
                    pedicabs and charcoal-burning taxis, the poverty, the still-visible scars of the
                    war's air raids, and the subservient demeanor of the Japanese, which was so hard
                    to reconcile with the image we had of a fanatical, brutal enemy.</p>
                <p>At sea, my duties were to send out meteorological reports four times a day, every
                    six hours. These became part of the network of reports worldwide that became the
                    data from which meteorologists drew their weather maps and made forecasts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, looking at it as a practical thing, troop transports
                        aroff by themselves, probably out where most of the fleet wouldn't be.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>Q: That might be one reason why they had you as part of the net, since they
                    covered areas that wouldn't necessarily be covered by their own group.</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Well that's a good point, yes. And transports spent a lot of time at
                    sea, covering a lot of territory, consequently providing a lot of useful
                    meteorological data.</p>
                <p>So I had those four reports to do. Every morning I got from the radio shack the
                    worldwide meteorological reports, from which I decoded the data, plotted it on a
                    blank map, filled in air masses and fronts, and from that made a forecast for
                    the captain. Then, when I had finished that and until the next six-hour report,
                    I was free to do what I wanted. I spent a lot of time back aft on the fantail
                    watching the sea unfold as we crossed the Pacific, watching the soaring
                    albatrosses, and reading, and reading, and reading. While I was in the navy I
                    had determined I was going on to college when I got out. I took what they called
                    USAFI (United States Armed Forces Institute) courses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can actually get college credit doing those
                        courses.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. I remember taking an English course, and I'm nosure what
                    else.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>During the first of the two years I was on the Mitchell, we sailed out to the Far
                    East and back, carrying troops, naval personnel, and dependents. We also went
                    down to Panama, through the canal - which was a great experience - to Puerto
                    Rico, Norfolk, and New York City. I had a great time there, roaming around with
                    two buddies, riding the subway, seeing my first major league baseball game at
                    Yankee Stadium, and going to the theater (also the first time for me), where we
                    saw Mr. Roberts. The ship went back through the canal, this time at night,
                    returned to California and then sailed again for the Far East. We were near Guam
                    when the Korean War broke out-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: June 25, 1950.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>We had some passengers for Kwajalein and Eniwetok. After going there and
                    disembarking them, the Mitchell returned quickly to the States, went up to
                    Bremerton, Washington to have our armament replaced or reactivated, and picked
                    up ammunition. Then we went over to Tacoma, where we picked up troops, and
                    headed for Korea. I remember that soldiers set up a machine gun on the after end
                    of the ship, put targets over the side, and fired at them. This was a clear sign
                    that these guys weren't all that well trained. They were training [laughter] on
                    a transport on the way over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I later read how ill-equipped, how unready some of our troops were
                    when they went into Korea, because the army had gotten fat and was poorly
                    prepared for warfare.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Anyway, we went into Pusan in July (by that time, there was a perimeter around
                    Pusan to which the South Koreans and the Americans had retreated), dropped off
                    the troops, and went back to the States to get more. But first we had to go into
                    the shipyard at Bremerton for the ship's periodic overhaul, after which we had a
                    shakedown cruise, picked up troops again at Tacoma, and went back to Korea in
                    October. The military situation had changed. The Americans were well up in the
                    north, heading for the Chinese border - MacArthur's terrible blunder. We
                    disembarked the troops at Inchon, went to Japan for more, and took this batch to
                    Inchon as well. By now, late November, the Chinese had entered the war and the
                    United Nations force was retreating. The Mitchell went to Hungnam, North Korea,
                    where the massive evacuation of the UN forces took place after they had
                    withdrawn south from the Yalu River. We took aboard allied troops, including
                    British and Turks, but mainly American soldiers and marines, some of them shot
                    up. I saw the face of war, how awful and utterly wasteful it was. The Mitchell
                    and her crew were part of the operation that evacuated 100,000 UN troops and
                    over 90,000 Korean civilians. U.S. naval and air bombardment kept the Chinese at
                    bay until the evacuation was completed on December 24.</p>
                <p>We sailed to Pusan, picking up on the way a boatload of Koreans who were fleeing
                    to the south. The civilians and many of the troops were disembarked at Pusan. I
                    remember how ironic it was as Christmas approached that we had heard that
                    MacArthur had, in essence, promised that the American troops in Korea would be
                    home for Christmas. We spent Christmas Eve in the port of Yokosuka, dropping off
                    the wounded and the others whom we took to Japan rather than Korea. The ship had
                    been much overloaded with troops, carrying more than twice our normal capacity,
                    and we were short on food. We ate a kind of hamburger gruel from the time we
                    loaded the troops at Hungnam until we reached Japan. During daytime hours, there
                    was a never-ending line into the chow hall. When we got to Japan, some steak and
                    eggs, the navy's haute cuisine, was brought aboard for our Christmas Eve
                    dinner.</p>
                <p>The Mitchell returned to San Francisco in January, then sailed again to Japan and
                    Korea in February, leaving the Far East in late March. On April 14, 1951, I left
                    the ship and reported for duty at NAS (Naval Air Station) North Island, San
                    Diego. In May, I volunteered to be part of the navy's annual expedition to
                    resupply Point Barrow, Alaska. Headed by a commodore, the operation was called
                    COMBAREX. I waited at the amphibious base at Coronado, doing some preliminary
                    logistical work with three other aerographers while COMBAREX ships were being
                    loaded. In July, we boarded the USS Seminole, an attack cargo vessel, and off we
                    went up north, skirting the Aleutians, and heading northwest up into the Bering
                    Straits. We passed through the Chukchi Sea and went east around the top of
                    Alaska to the most northern point in the United States, Point Barrow. At that
                    time of the year, the ice flow had receded to the extent that ships could get in
                    and the small base and the oil workers there could be supplied for the coming
                    year. While our cargo was being unloaded, I visited the town and wandered around
                    the tundra. We played a softball game with the Eskimos, who beat us. I stayed
                    awake for 48 hours because the sun never went down and there was a lot of noise
                    aboard ship. Then we headed back to Coronado, arriving in September.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>In November, I was then transferred to NAS Corpus Christi, Texas. I bought a car
                    while on leave in San Luis Obispo, a 1946 Ford. It looked to me like a good car.
                    But I hadn't got very far on my way to Texas when I found that it drank a quart
                    of oil every 50 miles [laughter]. I chugged across the southwestern United
                    States to Corpus Christi and began my work there for the last nine months of my
                    enlistment. As a petty officer second class, I headed a section of aerographers
                    at the naval air station, doing, among other things, forecasts for the naval
                    aircraft that flew patrols out into the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
                <p>While I was at Corpus Christi, I got some flight time. I had never wanted to go
                    up in airplanes, particularly naval aircraft, but to get some flight pay, I flew
                    as an observer in an SNJ, a primary trainer that was used for meteorological
                    observations. Affixed to the plane was an instrument for recording barometric
                    pressure, temperature, and so forth. I was fascinated by what I saw from the
                    air, by the view below and by what was in the sky, the cumulus clouds boiling up
                    as we ascended. I thought, “You know, I'd like to fly one of these things.” I
                    had a friend who was a pilot. He got some training films from the air station's
                    library. They were narrated by film actor Robert Taylor, who'd been an
                    instructor during World War II. Encouraged even more by the films, I went off
                    the base to Cuddihy Field, a civilian airport, and took flight lessons. After
                    eight hours of flight instruction, I soloed. It was one of those days you never
                    forget. It was breezy and there was a crosswind on the runway. But I managed to
                    get the airplane up and down without killing myself. After 35 hours, I got my
                    license. The day I got my license, I went out to one of the available airplanes
                    - Don Petterson, ace pilot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: The airplanes I was flying, mainly Aeronca Champions, didn't have
                    radios. So, after taxiing to the edge of the runway, I faced the tower, got a
                    green light, turned, went out onto the runway and took off. For some reason I
                    had turned 180 degrees wrong and was taking off downwind. It was a long runway,
                    thank goodness. I couldn't understand why it was taking me so long time to get
                    airborne. I was shooting landings, and on the final leg of my first attempt, got
                    a red light from the tower. I couldn't figure it out. What's going on? Then
                    suddenly it dawned on me what I had done. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I got back into the right pattern, landed into the wind,and went up to
                    the tower, where I was put in my place!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: But I loved the flying. It was a great relief from the navy and the
                    overbearing officer who was running the aerology department. I flew
                    cross-country as far as Galveston and shorter hops to places like Alice,
                    Victoria, and Palacios. Had a great time. I really enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>Then the time came to get out of the navy, and I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go? You left in when? This would be about
                        '52?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, I completed my hitch in the navy on July 22, 1952. I had enlisted
                    on July 23, 1948. I drove out of the gate, took off my hat, threw it in the back
                    of the car, took off the black low-cut navy shoes, which I hated, and threw them
                    into the bay, got back in my car, and drove away. I passed through Colorado,
                    where I visited friends, and proceeded to San Luis Obispo, where I enrolled that
                    September in San Luis Obispo Junior College, a very, very small junior
                    collegenrollment then was less than one hundred. Still intending to become a
                    coach, I took required lower-division courseEnglish, economics, history,
                    chemistry. I took an anatomy course, in which we dissected cats. I went out for
                    football, but there weren't enough players to field a football team. So I waited
                    a bit and went out for basketball, where I became a part of the second-worst
                    junior college team in the nation (I calculated we were second worst because we
                    only beat one other junior college team, and they were awful). [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I was the sixth man on the squad. There were about ten of us. I
                    started occasionally, but generally I came in off the bench. I had a lot of
                    playing time and did reasonably well. I was, again, no great athlete. I was
                    planning on going to San Jose State, which had a good physical education
                    program. I had straight A's, except for one course I took in radio broadcasting.
                    The teacher didn't think much of my acting ability [laughter].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: But academically I had done very well. I was still intending to go to
                    San Jose, when friends of mine asked me to come along with them to Santa
                    Barbara. My best friend and two girls we liked were hoping to get scholarships
                    at UC (University of California) Santa Barbara. I went with them and, lo and
                    behold, I was offered a scholarship, not an athletic scholarship, but an
                    academic one. That decided that: I would enroll in Santa Barbara. While we were
                    there, I talked to the football coach, who, surprisingly, encouraged me to try
                    out for the team. Mind you, I weighed 132 pounds, which shows you how desperate
                    he was!</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: On top of that, I wasn't particularly fast [laughter] - small, slow
                    halfback. Well, I was fairly fast.</p>
                <p>With my friend Bill Blythe, I went to Santa Barbara and in September 1953
                    enrolled as a physical education major. In the next three years I had fun and
                    worked hard. I was determined to get as stellar an academic record as I could
                    because I knew I was not going to be a hotshot athlete and would not have that
                    as a credential to get a good coaching job. I did well academically and also
                    managed to stay on the football team, which, again, is a commentary on UC Santa
                    Barbara's prowess as a football power in those days. Out of ten games scheduled,
                    we might win four. We never had a winning season in those three years. Our
                    coach, Stan Williamson, an All-American center from USC, called us “his little
                    intellectuals.” [Laughter] There were some good ball players, one of which
                    became an All-American and went on to play pro football.</p>
                <p>I remember that when I was a senior. I had visions of moving up from third string
                    to become second-string left halfback. But Stan brought a kid over from the
                    track team who hadn't played football before. I was annoyed. This guy couldn't
                    block or tackle. But, boy, could he run! He learned enough of the rudiments of
                    the game that I soon was back where I belonged on third string! Johnny Morris
                    went on to be an All-American and play for the Chicago Bears. I played a little
                    bit, now and then, and got my letter.</p>
                <p>Before I graduated, I had student teaching. I was lucky to get a coaching
                    position. Usually physical education student teachers taught physical education
                    classes at a junior or senior high school. I'd had one session of that at a
                    junior high school. But I also became the junior varsity basketball coach at
                    Santa Barbara Catholic High School. My team won the league title. Catholic
                    High's head coach and athletic director offered me a job, while I was still in
                    school (I had started graduate school by that time), coaching the varsity
                    baseball team. I took the job.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, after graduating in 1956, I had changed my major. I had decided
                    that, although I liked the coaching of the games, I did not like the physical
                    education side of the profession. Nor did I really care for the drudgery of
                    practice day in and day out. I realized that I did not want to be doing this for
                    the rest of my life.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>So I switched to political science. A girlfriend of mine was a political science
                    major. She talked me into taking a course. I found it interesting, the professor
                    liked me, and I decided I would work for a master's degree in political science.
                    This required me to take some of the liberal arts lower division requirements
                    that I didn't have to take for my BA degree in physical education, including a
                    foreign language and certain other courses. I took those at the same time I was
                    taking the master's degree course work. After two more years at Santa Barbara, I
                    had finished the course work and written most of my thesis. But my scholarship
                    and G.I. Bill benefits had run out. I didn't have the wherewithal to go on for a
                    Ph.D.</p>
                <p>I had been working all the years I was at school. I drove a school bus when I was
                    in junior college. I worked one summer as a roustabout for the Continental Oil
                    Company in Ventura, three summers for the California State Division of Highways
                    in San Luis Obispo, and another summer for an oil exploration company on a boat
                    off the California coast. During the school years at Santa Barbara, I had
                    various part-time jobs, including hasher at a sorority house.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Washing dishes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Washing dishes and, you know, making friends. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: College was good times; a lot of work, but a lot of fun. Santa Barbara
                    was a fine place to be; sometimes a little hard to study on sunny days, when the
                    beach time was beckoning. But finally in 1958 I had everything just about ready
                    for the MA (Master of Arts). I had to complete my thesis, which was on the Latin
                    American foreign policy of the Truman administration. I decided I had to leave
                    Santa Barbara. My friends had finished school, some had married, most had gone
                    somewhere else, and I had been in Santa Barbara for too long.</p>
                <p>So I went to Los Angeles and looked for work, thinking that perhaps I could get a
                    job using my special credential in physical education. But that proved a dead
                    end. Then one day I saw an ad in the L.A. Times, went to the State Building
                    downtown, and with 300 other candidates applied for a job with the California
                    State Personnel Board as a personnel analyst. I took a test, had an interview,
                    and got the job, which kept me in food and housing and allowed me to save some
                    money. During that year, I worked for the Personnel Board giving examinations to
                    applicants for various kinds of state jobs, writing ad copy, and making
                    recruiting trips to college campuses.</p>
                <p>Sometime during that year, I applied for a teaching assistantship at UCLA
                    (University of California at Los Angeles) and was accepted. In the fall of 1959,
                    I left my job with the state, enrolled in the graduate program of the political
                    science department at UCLA, and began working as a teaching assistant.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Let me go back to my second year in graduate school, 1957-1958. A friend of mine
                    told me he was going to take the Foreign Service examination and suggested that
                    I also take it. Well, I had no idea what the Foreign Service was. My focus for
                    three years had been on physical education, and I had only completed one year of
                    studies in political science. There was one hell of a lot that I did not know,
                    including anything about diplomacy or the Foreign Service. So I went to the
                    professor who was handling the applications, talked to him about the Foreign
                    Service, and thought, “Well, that sounds interesting!” My friend and I drove to
                    Los Angeles in December, the month the examination was given.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was the first Saturday in December, I think, in those
                        days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know what it is today.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: The test was given in a large room in the Federal Building and took
                    several hours of the morning and afternoon. There were many candidates. On the
                    way back to Santa Barbara, I told my friend that I was sure I had failed because
                    I had missed so many questions (not realizing that the test was not scored on an
                    absolute basis, but on a curve, a relative basis). In January, I was notified
                    that, to my surprise, I had passed the written examination and was therefore
                    eligible to take the oral examination. Well, that was interesting! Ironically,
                    my friend, who was a very good scholar and fine political science major, did not
                    pass the exam.</p>
                <p>In March or April, I went to Los Angeles again to present myself to the oral
                    board. In the terminology of those times, I “tubed” the oral exam. The three
                    examiners asked a lot of questions about the United States, its history,
                    geography, and economics. Of course, there were other questions too. I simply
                    was not up to speed. After the exam, I went out into the hallway to await the
                    verdict. A few minutes the chairman of the board came out of the examination
                    room and let me know I hadn't passed. But he intimated that I ought to think
                    about taking it again. So I thought, “Well, by gosh, you know, I will!” However,
                    the State Department did not give the examination that December. It would not be
                    given again until December 1959, when I was studying and working at UCLA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a grad student, were you going towards a Ph.D.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, I was pointed in that direction. I had read some articles that
                    previous summer in Holiday, a magazine that was quite popular in those days. The
                    issue I had read was devoted to Africa. I was fascinated. My focus, such as it
                    was, had been on Latin America...</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: As you would guess from the subject of my Master's thesis. But after
                    reading this issue on Africa, I determined that I would switch my focus to
                    Africa. I was fortunate that James Coleman, one of America's premier
                    Africanists, was at UCLA. He became my mentor, my advisor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just might add that 1960 was when the United States
                        discovereAfrica.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: That's right.</p>
                <p>Q: I mean Africa was sort of exploding as a point of interest, all the countries
                    becoming independent. We saw this as a great opportunity to spread our
                    influence, and it was very exciting.</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: That's right. Of course, it was at the height of the cold war, we were
                    vying with the Soviets for influence in Africa, and accordingly we put a lot of
                    resources into Africa. As you know, American interest in Africa was marginal at
                    best in the pre-World War II days; it intensified somewhat during the war
                    because of the continent's military significance. But it really wasn't until the
                    late '50s and early '60s, the time of the explosion of African independence,
                    that Africa became important in the eyes of the U.S. government.</p>
                <p>In 1959, when I started at UCLA, Jim Coleman was helping bring prominent
                    Africans, people like Joshua Nkomo, to the campus. S�kou Tour� addressed the
                    student body; so did John Kennedy, incidentally. It was an exciting time. I very
                    much enjoyed my work with Coleman.</p>
                <p>But I very much despaired over some of the other coursework that I had to take.
                    The political science department was approaching political science through a
                    sociological prism, stressing the work of Max Weber and Gabriel Almond. I found
                    their writings, not Weber's so much, but Almond's and some of the other
                    contemporary sociologists next to unintelligible. I wanted a more traditional
                    approach to political science and came to realize that I wasn't going to
                    continue with the Ph.D. beyond that first year, not at UCLA. But I had the TA
                    (Teaching Assistantship} and I continued my studies. Then, in December, the
                    Foreign Service officer exam was given again, and I took it.</p>
                <p>I passed the written again, began to prepare for the oral, and wrote the State
                    Department that I would prefer to come to Washington to take the exam rather
                    than wait until the board was set up in Los Angeles. I wanted to show them that
                    I was very serious. I flew to Washington and took the examination in April.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: April of 19...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Nineteen sixty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nineteen sixty, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: And passed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to catch the flavor of this, if possible. Can you
                        givsome idea of some of the questions that were asked at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Hmm. Two other graduate students at UCLA and I wrote an article on the
                    oral examination for the Foreign Service Journal, which printed it. I re-read it
                    not too long ago. At the outset of the oral, the examiners asked me what my
                    objectives were, what I wanted to do with my life, and why I wanted to join the
                    Foreign Service. In part those questions were designed to put the candidate at
                    ease, but, I later learned, the substance of the response and the candidate's
                    expressiveness were important. I remember there were questions like, “Tell us
                    where the Snake River is.” “What are the leading products of this Illinois?” I
                    had prepped myself on that sort of thing and I did well. I recall that I was
                    asked questions about Africa and Latin America and about current affairs in the
                    United States. Woe unto the examinee who was not abreast of major events covered
                    in the press. I was asked how I, as an American official, would handle a
                    hypothetical problem that arose in an embassy.</p>
                <p>The examination lasted an hour, and I knew I had done better than before. The
                    three examiners seemed to be somewhat intrigued that a former physical education
                    major was in front of them. I went outside the examination room to wait for the
                    result, which in those days, unlike now, was given right away. The chairman came
                    out and told me I'd passed. I was on cloud nine, because I had been pretty
                    gloomy about my future in political science.</p>
                <p>Q: I'd just like to capture a little of this too. I was a history major in
                    college, and I've always kind of wondered what a lot of this stuff is on
                    political science. What do they do? Particularly, I find it so impertinent to
                    anything that I know, outside of recent history. I mean, what is all this
                    stuff?</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: Well, sure. Political science is an oxymoron. I mean, there's no
                    science to it. There have been attempts to make a more scientific approach to
                    politics and international relations. But in reality much of political science
                    is largely historical. There are theories of international relations, which put
                    political science it in a somewhat different light than history. And political
                    theory is deeply grounded in philosophy. I believe political science stands as a
                    separate discipline from history, as such, but it certainly is not a
                    science.</p>
                <p>Q: But I guess this is a case that remains a case. Different universities,
                    different departments, are dominated by a certain way of looking at things, is
                    that it?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. At UCLA the attempt at that time was to find a different approach
                    to political science and, it seemed to me, perhaps to give it a certain kind of
                    added legitimacy. I don't think that effort lasted very long, but I'm not sure.
                    For me the approach was obtuse, the jargon even more so, and I was miserable
                    trying to become a part of this. But, at the same time I was happy to be working
                    with Jim Coleman.</p>
                <p>Not knowing whether I would pass the Foreign Service exam, I was considering that
                    after I left UCLA, I might opt for a career working overseas for an American
                    company. To do this, I would study for a year at Thunderbird - the American
                    Institute of Foreign Trade at Tempe, Arizona. I was already figuring how I was
                    going to get the $500 I would need for enrolling, and where I might work that
                    summer to earn enough money to make it through at least the beginning months at
                    Thunderbird.</p>
                <p>When I passed the Foreign Service exam, my troubles ended. I remember going down
                    to the first floor of New State, whose construction was barely finished.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I was just saying, I took it in a Quonset hut next to
                        olState, but by that time, it was a whole new building.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. I went to a bank of pay phones on the first floor, just outside
                    of the cafeteria. I called my parents with great elation and said I was going to
                    become a Foreign Service officer. I had taken my wallet out, in which I had a
                    phone number or two. I was so pumped up that, after calling, I rushed off and
                    left the wallet behind [laughter].</p>
                <p>I went back to where I was staying in Virginia with a naval officer friend of
                    mine from college, realized I had lost the wallet, called, and found, to my deep
                    pleasure and relief, that somebody had turned it in to lost and found. There
                    probably wasn't a lot of money in it [laughter]!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: So the day ended on another high note. I flew back to Los Angeles,
                    dropped a course or two, continued my work as a TA (Teaching Assistant), and
                    continued my studies with Jim Coleman. A few weeks later, at the end of the
                    school year, I drove to Santa Barbara, where I stayed on a little farm with two
                    other college friends. We looked after the farm's orchard, and I drove taxi, a
                    Yellow cab, in Santa Barbara.</p>
                <p>I was in a sense living in a dream world. I had no idea there was a register and
                    that I could have been low enough on the register not to have been called in. So
                    I blissfully was waiting for a call, and, thank God, it came! [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any idea really what the Foreign Service was
                        about-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: No!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not only the administrative side, but what Foreign Service
                        peopldid? Did you have any contact with any Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: No. I knew nobody from the Foreign Service. I had read, of course, the
                    State Department literature about the examination and some basic information
                    about a career in the Foreign Service. But I really didn't know what I was
                    getting into. I knew only that I was going to become employed on a full time and
                    that I was going to embark on a career that would take me overseas. What little
                    I did know sounded great, especially superimposed on my tremendous relief at
                    finally getting out of the academic grind, which had become really onerous
                    because of the situation I found at UCLA.</p>
                <p>Well, in June...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sixty?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: June of 1960, about June sixth or seventh, I had a call from Personnel
                    in State offering me a chance to enter a class at FSI (Foreign Service
                    Institute) in one week's time. Could I make it?</p>
                <p>“Sure I could,” I said. Fortunately for me, I had passed the exam with a score
                    that put me high on the register, thereby enabling me to get in a class that
                    soon. I said goodbye to my friends, said goodbye to Yellow cab, got in my car,
                    and drove to San Luis Obispo to say goodbye to my parents. I was driving my 1958
                    Volkswagen Bug, which I couldn't afford when I bought it. But the monthly
                    payments were only something like $29, which even I could afford! I loved that
                    car, underpowered little Bug! It was the first new car I'd ever had.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>From San Luis I drove north to Chico to say goodbye to my brother who was working
                    there, his family, and my grandmother. I headed east, crossed the Sierras, and
                    for five days drove across the United States. I went through Salt Lake City,
                    Denver, and across the Plains and the Midwest into Pennsylvania, down into
                    Maryland and Washington, arriving on June 12. The next day I went over to the
                    Department, presented myself, and was subsequently sent over to Arlington Towers
                    to join my A-100 class, which was already in session. And there it began.</p>
                <p>Q: Could you characterize how you felt, characterize the A-100 course, some of
                    the people who were in it, what you were picking up about the Foreign Service,
                    and that sort of thing?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Sure. I was deeply impressed by the quality of the people in my A-100
                    course. There were twenty of us, a small class. The next class had forty
                    members.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I met people like Hume Horan and Norm Anderson. Both of these fellows
                    could speak more than one foreign language. I couldn't manage even one at that
                    point. My two closest friends in the class were Margaret Beshore, the only woman
                    in the class. She was very a talented, bright, outgoing, beautiful young woman.
                    And Jim Baker, James E. Baker, who was the only black in the course. More than
                    half the class had attended Ivy League schools. One, Tom Greene, had a Ph.D.,
                    and another, George Rueckert, was a Ph.D. candidate. There were many MA degrees
                    and one or two law degrees. It was a very talented group, and I felt like a
                    hayseed in a way. I was the only West Coaster. There was a fellow from Nevada,
                    very bright, very intense - Doug Ramsey, who later was a captive of the Viet
                    Cong for several years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: There was all this talent, which I saw arrayed as the days went by. I
                    didn't have a sense of inferiority, but I knew I was in a select group of
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes! [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: We suffered through some very boring lectures about the overseas
                    activities of the Department of Commerce, Department of Agriculture, and other
                    foreign affairs agencies. But we learned the rudiments of what the Foreign
                    Service was all about. We had speakers on foreign policy issues. Some were good,
                    some not so good. The course was very much an introduction into how the State
                    Department worked, what the Foreign Service was, and what the foreign affairs
                    community consisted of. It didn't last long, six weeks as I recall.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think about six weeks, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: The time passed quickly. We had one weekend out at Front Royal where
                    we really got to know each other. I found that all these talented people did not
                    meet the stereotypical notion of a Foreign Service officer corps populated
                    largely by an Ivy League elite, which of course was false to begin with. My
                    classmates were, by and large, people from middle class backgrounds. Most of
                    them had served in the military and most, like me, had been enlisted personnel.
                    They were down-to-earth, very bright, very pleasant, outgoing people. I formed
                    some lasting friendships, especially with Maggie, Jim Baker, and Mark
                    Lissfelt.</p>
                <p>Q: I have to say, that it's been my experience as I've done these interviews, and
                    I put myself into this category, too, particularly of our generation. They came
                    really, for the most part, from rather modest backgrounds. But, often,
                    particularly because I think the universities were much more open in those days,
                    you could go to a Harvard or Yale on a GI bill without having a lot of money or
                    something of that nature. If you were bright and you earned enough credit under
                    the GI bill from your military service that you could go anywhere, there was a
                    tendency for the right people to head for the Harvards and Yales.</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Sure.</p>
                <p>Q: So then they headed for the Foreign Service, and there's been this feeling,
                    well, you know, because the Harvards or Yales, they come from moneyed East Coast
                    families and all that, which isn't the truth. It was just because people with
                    both intelligence and drive would often head for these schools. So their
                    backgrounds were much more modest and much more middle American than one might
                    imagine.</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: This was very true of my class, of those who had gone to Harvard, Yale
                    or other Ivy League schools. I was impressed by their credentials, but more so
                    by their personalities and their abilities. It's curious that the three of us
                    that became ambassadors, Hume Horan, G. Norman Anderson, and Don Petterson all
                    had assignments as ambassadors to Sudan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I had been counseled at the Department by a middle-grade or senior
                    officer, I can't recall which. He said I should count on a Washington
                    assignment. I was a bachelor, and he thought I should stay around Washington
                    with the idea that I could find an American bride.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Q: [Laughter] Yes, I've heard this before. This is sort of the idea. You're sort
                    of assigned to go out and find yourself an American wife. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: He also said he was recommending that I take French language training
                    because I wanted to go to Africa at some point. I had expressed the wish to
                    divide my career between Latin America and Africa. He said I could take French
                    during my departmental assignment. And that is what he laid out for me.</p>
                <p>In the last week of the A-100 course, the twenty of us sat around a table,
                    waiting to hear what our assignments would be. Somebody came over from the
                    Department and opened up the envelope. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter] Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: “And now...” He went around the table with the assignments. Margaret
                    was hoping to go to Mexico. I was sure I was going to stay in the Department. It
                    turned out that Margaret was assigned to Panama and I to Mexico, to the embassy
                    in Mexico City. The more I thought about it, the more I liked the idea. I was
                    going to go abroad, learn a language - because I would have to take Spanish
                    before going to Mexico - and begin my career in a very positive, for me,
                    way.</p>
                <p>I began FSI's intensive course in Spanish. I had had Spanish in junior high
                    school, a couple more years in high school, and a year or so in college. So I
                    had had a fair amount of Spanish in school. At FSI, I went in for a preliminary
                    test, and was asked something in Spanish. I had no idea what that person was
                    saying! As it turned out, the Spanish teacher said, “Que hora es?” What time is
                    it? Well I knew the word “que,” I knew the word “hora,” and I knew the word
                    “es.” But I'd had such little conversational Spanish in those school years that
                    when she strung it together, I simply did not understand. “Que-hora- es?” Well,
                    I got a zero plus in speaking, though somewhat higher on the written portion of
                    the test. Then began the course. Most of those 14 weeks, it was just Margaret
                    Beshore and I, so we got a lot of good time with the language tutors. I ended
                    with a three in speaking and a three-plus in reading.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>I took the consular course after that. As you know, in those days most junior
                    officers who did go overseas had a consular assignment for their first job. That
                    was the case for me. I was going to Mexico as a vice consul and third secretary
                    to be assigned to the visa section of the embassy's consular section. Therefore,
                    the consular course was very meaningful to me. A heavy portion of it was on visa
                    laws and regulations. The course was given by a consular officer, Harvey Cash,
                    who was excellent. I completed the course work, got in my car, took my meager
                    possessions (everything I had went in the back seat of the Volkswagen), and
                    drove to Mexico. I went down through Virginia, into the Carolinas, across the
                    tip of Georgia, across Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, and into Texas. Then
                    I took the old Pan American Highway down the eastern range of the Sierra Madre
                    Mountains. As I drove to Mexico City, I was on top of the world, being able to
                    use a foreign language for the first time in my life, listening to the radio,
                    reading the signs along the roads and in the towns, and talking to people when I
                    stopped for food, lodging, or gasoline.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On your way down to Mexico, this is 1961?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: January of 1961. I was in Washington during the election and left just
                    before the inauguration of John Kennedy. It was an exciting time to be in
                    Washington and to join the U.S. government. At least it certainly was for me,
                    and I'm certain many-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think for most people there was a real spirit at the
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're a part of the new generation taking over, and the
                        world'your oyster, and we had a role to play.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I was a staunch supporter of Kennedy. During the election, when I
                    first got to Washington, I lived with five naval officers, my friend and four of
                    his colleagues, all of whom were deep-dyed Republicans and thought that Richard
                    Nixon was by far the best candidate. I lived with these guys as a Democrat and
                    backer of Kennedy in the election and was very pleased with the outcome of it
                    [laughter].</p>
                <p>I had an intense interest in politics and government, especially the new Kennedy
                    government. It embodied a new generation, as you know. I remember watching as
                    Kennedy would come out on the stoop of his Georgetown house and announce who was
                    going to be what in his government. His first appointment was-</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was Soapy Williams.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Soapy Williams, yes.</p>
                <p>Anyway, there I was in Mexico. I'd been overseas when I was in the navy, but I'd
                    never been immersed in the culture and the life, as I would be in Mexico, nor
                    had I ever had the language, so I was quite happy as I drove down into Mexico.
                    But I became terrified when I got into my first traffic circle. To me it was a
                    wild scene. It seemed as if drivers were bent on suicide as they zoomed into the
                    circle. I managed to get the car to the hotel, which was near the embassy, and
                    park it. I didn't get back in the car, literally, for a week after that. Later,
                    I learned to drive like a citizen of Mexico City and went charging into traffic
                    circles like everyone else. The trick was to look straight ahead and not worry
                    about what was on either side of you.</p>
                <p>I reported in to the embassy, where I began working very soon afterward in the
                    non-immigrant visa section. The embassy in those days was housed in the Sanborn
                    Building. Sanborn's famous Mexican restaurant was on the ground floor, and some
                    commercial offices occupied the next few floors. The consular section was on the
                    fourth floor. The rest of the embassy didn't begin till the sixth floor, so we
                    were physically separated from other embassy sections. As time went on, I
                    realized that the consular officers felt more than physically separated from the
                    rest of the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter] I like to put at the beginning of each section.
                        Yoserved in Mexico from 1961 until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: From January of '61 until about September or October o'62. My Mexican
                    assignment was cut short.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what type of work were you doing? Can you describe a
                        littlbit the atmosphere of the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. The caseload for the non-immigrant visa officer in Mexico was
                    enormous. We had, literally, hundreds of applicants a day, as many as a thousand
                    or more in the peak season. There were, I think, four or five of us. I can
                    recall working with Bill Hallman, Carolyn Kingsley, Walt West, and there would
                    have been another officer on the line, called the NIV line. Mexico City was well
                    known in the Service as a “visa mill.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: We sat in cubicles separated from the applicants, who were in a
                    waiting room right outside of our cubicles. They entered through swinging doors.
                    Frosted glass in the doors assured our privacy and the privacy of anybody who
                    came in for an interview. Behind us were windowed walls with openings through
                    which the papers of the applicants came through, given to us by the Mexican visa
                    clerks. We visa-issuing officers were in a row, large walls affording us a view
                    of what was going on in each other's cubicle.</p>
                <p>The work consisted of sifting out the many bona fide non-immigrant visa
                    applicants from the possible or probable non bona fide non-immigrant visa
                    applicants. The first step was to look at the application to see where the
                    person lived, his or her profession, and so forth. In many cases, it was quite
                    obvious that the applicant was from an upscale colonia or section of Mexico
                    City, going on a business trip, or shopping, or to visit relatives - clearly
                    eligible for a visa. In these cases we didn't interview the person. We just
                    stamped the passport, signed the visa, and sent the papers back to the
                    clerks.</p>
                <p>If in reading an applicant's data card, you had doubts - let's say the applicant
                    was a campesino who was going to visit his brother in Chicago, where thousands
                    of Mexican illegal immigrants had gone for work, then you had to talk to him.
                    The refusal rate was quite high, because many people knew that it was a long
                    wait for an immigrant visa, and that they might not be able to qualify anyway.
                    Consequently, they tried to get through by getting a non-immigrant visa. Again,
                    the refusal rate in Mexico City was quite high. All kinds of people wanted to go
                    to the States for different reasons. For example, there were what we called “the
                    maid cases.” A young woman would come in with an American couple, who said they
                    were sponsoring her. They claimed they had befriended this young girl, who was
                    uneducated, and wanted to take her to the United States to help her in her
                    education and to acquaint her with American culture. Well, these were obvious
                    falsehoods, but required polite refusals, because we knew the Americans would
                    demand that we'd give the visa or demand to see our superiors. One learned
                    tact.</p>
                <p>Working in the visa section was a very good opportunity to begin a career, to use
                    the foreign language that you had acquired and were still learning, and to meet
                    Mexicans and, through them, learn more about Mexico.</p>
                <p>It also afforded me a chance to meet a young lady. Just before I left Washington
                    I had my final advice from my counselor. I don't recall much of what he told me,
                    but I do vividly remember he said, “Young man, whatever you do, do not marry a
                    foreigner. This will be bad for your career.”</p>
                <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: I'd been on the visa line less than a week. If I approved a visa, I
                    had to pass it over to Bill Hallman so he could sign it, because I didn't have a
                    stamp yet with my name on it. One day about a week after I'd started working, an
                    application form came to me. I looked at the picture and saw it was the face of
                    a beautiful young woman. She had applied for a visa to go to Brownsville, Texas,
                    with an aunt to go shopping. She was from a nice colonia. There was no reason to
                    interview her, but I wanted to see her personally! [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: So I got on the loudspeaker system and called her in. She came in, and
                    indeed she was a beautiful young lady. I asked her some pro forma questions. I
                    didn't know what to say or do, other than conduct the interview. She was a
                    little bit nonplused. She wondered why had she been called in. Most people that
                    day had not been called in. But she answered the questions and went out. I
                    turned over to Hallman and said, “Bill, what do I do? How can I meet this girl?”
                    And he said, “Well, ask her for her phone number and tell her that you might
                    want to call.”</p>
                <p>So I called her back in. By this time she's really [laughter] perplexed. “What's
                    going on here?” Incidentally, she spoke no English. Somehow I got her phone
                    number. She went back out and told her sister about this crazy gringo. But I
                    guess she was intrigued to a certain extent.</p>
                <p>As it turned out, the shopping trip was called off. I, thinking that she'd gone
                    to Brownsville, waited ten days before I called her. She'd been waiting,
                    wondering if this strange foreigner would call. When I did call, I'd been
                    schooled in what to do by Bill Hallman, who spoke flawless Spanish with a
                    Mexican accent and really knew Mexico. He and his wife Eileen, who were
                    wonderful people, had Mexican friends and were well schooled in Mexican culture.
                    So Bill was my advisor on this, and he said I should telephone and ask
                    permission to go to the house to call on the young lady. I did that, and as
                    Julie - her name is Julieta [Hoo-li-et-ta], and she was called “Zhu-lee” in her
                    family - as she later told me, all the extensions on the phone line were picked
                    up as soon as they knew it was the American. So I, in my not flawless Spanish,
                    asked for permission to come over to call on her, and I was given the
                    permission.</p>
                <p>Bill had advised me that the next step was to go meet the family and ask for
                    permission to take her out, if she was willing. I went to their house in Colonia
                    Polanco and met the family. It wasn't an ordeal, but I was a bit nervous and saw
                    this beautiful girl again. I chatted with her and then asked her for a date. She
                    was agreeable. I asked her mother or father (I don't recall now), for parental
                    approval, and got it. It was made clear that the date would have to be
                    chaperoned. Our first date was at the Palacio de Bellas Artes, where Van Cliburn
                    was giving a concert.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's a famous pianist?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: The famous pianist who in 1958 had won the Moscow prize. He was a
                    celebrity and a pianist of real note. It was agreed that Bill and Eileen
                    Hallman, a married couple from the embassy, and thus respectable in the eyes of
                    the Mexican family, would be the chaperones. I went to the house, and her
                    father's driver drove us to Bellas Artes. We met Bill and Eileen there, attended
                    the concert, and were driven back home, and that began the courtship.</p>
                <p>I went to the house frequently. Julie's brother-in-law, Joaquin, advised me to
                    come over every night. Why he did this, I'm not sure, but it was accepted by the
                    family, although they later told me they wondered why I visited so often. I
                    would drop in most evenings, and they'd feed me, [laughter] which helped me. It
                    helped me survive. Julie and I would sit in the parlor under the watchful eye of
                    an aunt who was in an adjoining room and could see us through a mirror. We would
                    talk. We would go to movies, always with someone from the family. Chaperoned, we
                    would take trips to places around Mexico City or to nearby towns, such as
                    Cuernavaca. We got to know each other, and before long, two months or so I
                    proposed. She accepted and we decided that we would get married in August.I
                    talked to Ann Claudius, who was the head of the consulate section. Ann was not
                    enthusiastic about the idea, but when she realized I was determined, she gave me
                    advice on what I needed to do, which was to send in a letter of resignation with
                    another letter asking for permission to marry a foreigner, as you had to do in
                    those days. There had been an executive order of the President written in 1939
                    that didn't prohibit marriages with foreigners but made them difficult. It made
                    clear that marrying a foreigner was not the best thing for the American Foreign
                    Service officer to do.</p>
                <p>At any rate, the papers went in, and Julie and I continued our courtship, still
                    under close scrutiny. [Laughter] She began studying English at the Binational
                    Institute - the USIS (United States Information Service) Binational Institute in
                    Mexico City. My Spanish kept getting better and better, since I used it not only
                    at work, but also outside of work. The day of our wedding began to approach,
                    without any word from Washington.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, a security examination had been conducted. Julie was asked to
                    come into the embassy to talk to a security officer. She came, and her mother
                    came with her. The security officer told me later that it was the first time he
                    had ever been cross-examined. When he started asking questions about Julie, her
                    mother began to ask questions about me. “Has this man ever been married before?”
                    that sort of thing. [Laughter]</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>Julie passed the security examination, and we had no reason to expect any
                    problem, but no answer from Washington. I didn't know what to do. My parents
                    were coming for the wedding. My mother had never been out of the United States.
                    My father had been only to France and Germany right after World War I, when he
                    was in the army. Coming to Mexico would be a big event for them. Invitations
                    were ready for the August wedding.</p>
                <p>Finally Ann sent a cable to Washington, to a friend in Personnel. The request had
                    simply been lying in somebody's in basket. So my resignation was turned down,
                    and permission was given to me to marry. On the 22nd of August, we had the civil
                    ceremony, after which she went home, [laughter] I went to my apartment, and, if
                    anything, the chaperoning was more intense. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: We were married on the 26th in a chapel of a private school. We
                    couldn't be married in the church as such, because I wasn't a Catholic. I had
                    gone to a priest for instruction. Then we had to get approval by the Church
                    authorities. One day Julie and I went to the Zocalo, the huge square in the old
                    part of Mexico City where the government buildings and the National Cathedral
                    were located. I was to be interviewed at the Cathedral. Julie's mother
                    accompanied us, which was fortunate because the priest, who was to pass on
                    whether or not this marriage should take place, had been their parish priest
                    years before. He recognized her, she recognized him and remembered that at that
                    time he had been living with a woman and their two children. So, if there had
                    been any dispensation on his part to give us trouble, that evaporated
                    immediately. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: With permission from the spiritual authorities and from the U.S.
                    government in hand, we were married first by the authorities of the Distrito
                    Federal de Mexico (Federal District of Mexico), and then by the Church, and we
                    began our married life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Don, could you tell me a bit about how you found the
                        embassrelations within the embassy and all from your vantage point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: Well, as I said earlier, the consular section was separated from the
                    rest of the embassy. We felt a little bit left out of things. We labored all day
                    on visa matters and didn't have all that much to do with the rest of the
                    embassy. In time, I got to know people from the upper reaches in our very large
                    embassy. As can happen, and often is the case in the largest embassies, there
                    was an institutional impersonality that came from the bigness. Leadership in the
                    front office can help overcome this. We had a well-regarded ambassador, Thomas
                    Mann, whom I was taken up to meet at one point and whom I did see once or twice
                    at the residence. But really, I had very little contact with the ambassador.</p>
                <p>I did my stint in NIVs (Non-immigrant Visas), and then went over to immigrant
                    visas for a while. There was a different type of caseload, but the work was just
                    as intense. In visa work we often seemed to be on the verge of exhaustion,
                    struggling with a very high volume of work. Perhaps that situation contributed
                    our sense of camaraderie. As busy as we were, some of us looked for
                    opportunities for political reporting. Most of us junior officers were
                    interested in the long haul in having a shot at political work. On at least a
                    couple of occasions, I got some worthwhile information from a visa applicant.
                    Once someone from El Salvador came through, I recall, and had something to say
                    of some interest to the front office, to the political section, or to the
                    ambassador's aide, who was a conduit for information that might come from
                    consular officers. It was considered an accomplishment if you could get a squib
                    into the Weekly, which was prepared by the embassy. The Weekly, as I think it
                    was entitled, was a compilation of information of lesser importance. It was the
                    kind of report that didn't go out telegraphically but was supposedly of interest
                    to some end users back in Washington. Not very exciting stuff. Still, if you got
                    a little bit of something into the weekly report, you felt had accomplished
                    something.</p>
                <p>My last job in the embassy was in the protection and welfare section, working
                    under Diego Asencio, who later became an ambassador, and who already possessed
                    qualities of leadership, and a lot of pizzazz as well. Diego was an operator.
                    For example, he had put together had a group of unpaid retainers, professional
                    people from the Mexican community. We would draw on them when we needed expert
                    advice or assistance to help Americans citizens get out of trouble. We had a
                    psychiatrist, we had a funeral director, we had a liaison with the police, and
                    so forth. I learned a lot from Diego.</p>
                <p>My particular specialty was dealing with the Federal Registry of Automobiles. An
                    American who drove his car into Mexico had to have certain kinds of papers, and
                    if he didn't keep those papers, or didn't leave the country with his car when he
                    was supposed to leave, he was in deep trouble. The Mexicans viewed any
                    irregularities with cars with deep suspicion because there was a lot of black
                    marketing going on in automobiles, and one could make big money bringing in an
                    American car and selling it illegally. I spent a considerable amount of time at
                    the Registry negotiating on behalf of Americans who had run afoul of it.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>I did the other kind of work that officers do in protection and welfare -
                    accident cases, hospitalizations, death cases, and people who were in jail for
                    one reason or another. Because of its proximity to the United States, and also
                    because, I was told by the psychiatrist we had on retainer, its culture was so
                    different from that of the U.S., Mexico attracted a lot of mentally unstable
                    Americans, some of whom had deep mental problems. A lot of them pitched up at
                    the embassy, and we had to deal with them. It was sometimes colorful work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Did you have any particular case or something that
                        yothought about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: One case, not in protection and welfare, but in NIVs, comes to my
                    mind. I think I handled it diplomatically. I saw the papers of a woman about 65
                    or 70 years of age who wanted to go to the States. She was from a good colonia,
                    but I thought that maybe I should talk to her. So I called her name on the
                    loudspeaker system, and I waited. Nothing happened. Then I saw through the
                    frosted glass the palm of a hand moving in a circular direction feeling the
                    glass. Then the hand moved across, and slight bit of pressure was put on the
                    door. The cubicle had a swinging double door, which was quite high so that no
                    one could see over it, and there was an open space of maybe a couple of feet at
                    the bottom.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Once again the hand appeared on the frosted glass. Then, before I
                    could get up, I looked down, and saw this elderly lady crawling under that
                    door.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, no. Oh, no.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: She had never seen a swinging door before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Swinging door before.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: So she-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Crawled...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: And I stood there with my mouth open. She got up, and I invited her to
                    sit down. I didn't know what to say. I didn't want to embarrass her. I talked to
                    her, concluded that she merited getting a visa, and told her so. She got up,
                    thanked me, and before I could say anything further, she got down on her hands
                    and knees and crawled out under the door. Maybe when she came in, I should have
                    said, “Madam, you shouldn't have crawled under that.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: But I didn't want to embarrass her.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: She was such a sweet lady. So I didn't say anything. I...I, well, what
                    you have done? I don't know whether what I did was right. But I didn't say
                    anything, and she crawled out. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Bill Hallman and Carolyn Kingsley on the two sides of me were cracking
                    up. [Laughter] I suppose that's not a very good example of how one learns to
                    become a diplomat or not, but...</p>
                <p>Q: Well, now I think one does face these things. I mean really very sweet people,
                    they're up against a foreign culture or something they're not used to, and
                    they're not quite sure how to react. They're trying to do the thing, and you
                    don't want to embarrass them. It's not awkward, but it's the sort of thing we
                    have to learn.</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. Well, after it was over, I didn't feel too bad, because there was
                    no laughter. There was no hush outside. Nobody wanted to embarrass the lady, I
                    guess. And anyway, and she got her visa.</p>
                <p>Protection and welfare strange cases? There's too many of them for me to remember
                    anything in particular. We had people who came in who said they were being
                    followed by American agents, a man who had a radio implanted in his body and was
                    being tracked, another who was under constant radar surveillance, a woman who
                    said strange people were trying to poison her, that kind of thing.</p>

                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, yes, things like that.</p>

                <p>You left there when, 1962?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, I had applied for hard language training, specifically for
                    Swahili. That summer of '62, I would say about July, I received notice that I
                    had been accepted for Swahili language training and that my onward assignment
                    after language training would be Zanzibar. Now this was a rare thing, when you
                    had advance notice a year ahead of time-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Not only of your training, but also of the followinassignment.</p>
                <p>Swahili language training was to start in November. We left several weeks
                    earlier, Julie and I with our baby, Susan, who had been born in late July and
                    was about two months old when we departed Mexico. We drove to California to see
                    friends and relatives. From there, wee drove across the United States, still in
                    the same VW (Volkswagen) Bug. We arrived just at the height of the Cuban Missile
                    Crisis. I began Swahili training, the second class in Swahili given by the
                    Foreign Service Institute. Julie enrolled in an English course in downtown
                    Washington. In my class, there were five of us going to various places,
                    including Uganda, Kenya, and, of course, Zanzibar. In time two people peeled off
                    early for their assignments, and we ended with three of us in the class. I
                    slogged through the Swahili and got a three, three. I had been reading all I
                    could about East Africa and Zanzibar. And Julie and I did what a Foreign Service
                    junior officer and his spouse would do in those days to get ready for a
                    Third-World assignment. We had to buy supplies of things we wouldn't find where
                    we were going, and we bought them as cheaply as possible. For example, with
                    another couple, we bought glassware from a restaurant supply store in
                    Washington, D.C. I bought my tropical suits from Schwartz-</p>

                <p>PETTERSON: Exactly, and at a price that a junior officer coulafford.</p>

                <p>PETTERSON: We didn't get princely salaries, but it was great when I first started
                    working to have a paycheck coming in regularly for the first time since I left
                    the navy. I started out at $5,500 or $5,600 a year. By this time, at the
                    beginning of 1963, I was making about $6,500.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: We got reservations on the USS Constitution. In those days you could
                    journey by sea if you were going to a place where U.S. lines were traveling. We
                    had a ten-day trip to Genoa, which was wonderful, a wonderful way to travel-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: A civilized way to travel. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter] Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: We went to Genoa and visited with our friend Carolyn Kingsley, who was
                    assigned to the consulate there. After two days, we took a train to Rome, where
                    we boarded a propeller aircraft for the trip to Nairobi. It was a long flight,
                    and it was late in the day when landed at Nairobi's airport. We transferred to a
                    DC-3 and flew to Mombasa, Tanga, and finally Zanzibar, arriving in the darkness
                    of night. Getting out of the airplane, we were enveloped by warm, humid tropical
                    air. We were met by Frederick “Fritz” Picard, the consul, and Dale Povenmire,
                    the vice-consul, and driven over to Fritz's house for dinner. From there we
                    passed through checkpoints manned by British soldiers. The pre-independence
                    elections had just been held, and there was tension on the island. We were taken
                    to our house, a thatch-roofed, whitewashed coral and lime structure that
                    originally was a stable. It would be our temporary home until Povenmire, whom I
                    was replacing, was transferred.</p>
                <p>Our life in Africa had begun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Zanzibar from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: From July 1963 until November 1965, over two years.</p>
                <p>Q: I wonder, could you explain what the situation was when you arrived, not what
                    happened after, but when you arrived, and what our consulate was doing or
                    expected? I think that's where we'll end it this time.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: The American consulate, the first consulate in Zanzibar, was
                    established in 1837. As a cost-saving measure, it was closed in 1915, but
                    reopened in 1961. The reopening was occasioned by the establishment of a Project
                    Mercury tracking station on Zanzibar Island.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, our space program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Project Mercury was the first manned space effort of the United
                    States, and tracking stations were set up at various places around the world.
                    Zanzibar was one of them. At that time, Zanzibar was moving toward independence.
                    It was a British protectorate under the guidance of British colonial
                    authorities, led by the resident. His title was “resident,” no“governor,”
                    because Zanzibar was a protectorate, not a colony as such. The protectorate
                    consisted of Zanzibar Island and the island of Pemba, which lay about 45 miles
                    northeast of Zanzibar, and a few very small islands. Arabs had dominated
                    Zanzibar since the end of the seventeenth century, when Omani Arabs seized
                    control of it. The Sultan of Oman moved his sultanate to Zanzibar in 1832. It
                    became a British possession in 1890, when the Germans, who had gained control of
                    Tanganyika and were on the verge of occupying Zanzibar, agreed to let the
                    British have it in exchange for Heligoland. The British ruled through the Sultan
                    of Zanzibar but retained ultimate power and administered the protectorate.</p>
                <p>There had been some turmoil in the years immediately leading up to independence,
                    because of deep antagonism between the black African majority and the Arab
                    minority who continued to dominate Zanzibar politically and, with the Asians,
                    people of Indian and Pakistani origin, economically. The Arabs were a minority,
                    with about 50,000 inhabitants, whereas the Africans numbered some 250,000. The
                    Asians, a community of about 20,000 divided into various religious sects, were
                    mainly businessmen, shopkeepers, and professional people, most of them living in
                    Zanzibar Town. The European community numbered about 500 - the British colonial
                    administrators, some business people, and spouses and children. The sixty or so
                    Americans in Zanzibar were counted as members of the European community.</p>
                <p>The elections in 1961 had been accompanied by riots and some killings. So the
                    British, concerned about the '63 elections, brought in troops, Scots Guards, to
                    maintain the peace. The election went off with no violence.</p>
                <p>Q: The election had taken place before you arrived?</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, just before our arrival in July 1963. A coalition of the Arab-led
                    Zanzibar Nationalist Party and a smaller party consisting mainly of people of
                    mixed blood, won the elections. There were accusations that the British had
                    gerrymandered the electoral constituencies so that the African majority would
                    not win. In the event though, it was the divisions among the Africans, their
                    inexperience in politics, and the organizing skills of the Arabs that won the
                    prize for the Arabs and their allies. An Arab named Ali Muhsin led the coalition
                    government.</p>
                <p>From the elections until independence, which came on December 12, 1963, although
                    the African politicians voiced strong opposition to the acts of the
                    pre-independence government, there were few overt signs of serious unrest among
                    the Africans. Yet, many worried that after independence there could be some
                    trouble, for the Africans were deeply upset by what had occurred. I remember
                    that a Special Branch police officer, a Briton who was about to leave Zanzibar,
                    told Fritz Picard that there would be trouble, but not until well into the
                    year.</p>
                <p>With the arrival of Zanzibar's independence, our small consulate became an
                    embassy. Picard, the consul, was to became the charg� d'affaires. I was the
                    other State Department embassy officer, and Stuart Lillico was the U.S.
                    Information Service officer. Imelda Johnson, was Fritz's secretary. The four of
                    us made up the American diplomatic establishment in Zanzibar. The other
                    Americans on the island, in addition to our families, were associated with the
                    tracking station.</p>
                <p>Q: Why don't we stop at this point, do you think? I think this is a good place.
                    We're talking about independence. You're getting ready for independence. We're
                    taking about December of '63, I guess, aren't you?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll pick it up at that point in Zanzibar, okay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Great.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Good morning. This is Lambert Heyninger, Nick Heyninger, and today is Friday,
                    November 30, 2000. I'm at the house of Ambassador Donald Petterson, Don
                    Petterson. We are picking up on his oral history four years after his interview
                    with Stu Kennedy.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>So, Don, let's start, and let me ask you what you have to say abouZanzibari
                    independence.</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Neither the British nor the Americans knew that for months, almost a
                    year, before independence, a shadowy figure by the name of John Okello was
                    making preparations for an armed revolt. The African majority party, the
                    Afro-Shirazi Party, which had lost the election, had determined that, if
                    necessary, they might resort to arms to take over the country, whose government
                    they believed rightfully belonged to them. Okello, who was from Uganda, had come
                    to Pemba in 1959. Four years later, in early 1963, he came to Zanzibar and began
                    plotting revolution. The handful of people in the Afro-Shirazi Party who became
                    aware of this did not include the party's leaders.</p>
                <p>During the independence ceremony, there was an ominous incident that foreshadowed
                    trouble. At midnight, when the British flag was lowered, the lights went out,
                    and when they went back on, the new Zanzibar government flag was raised. There
                    were cheers from among the gathered dignitaries, but the Africans, including the
                    hundreds who were off to the side of the cricket pitch where the independence
                    ceremony was held, were ominously quiet.</p>
                <p>On January 12, 1964, a month after independence, the revolution took place.
                    During that month, the Arab-dominated government had done just about everything
                    they should not have done to anger the Africans. They passed legislation that
                    was unfavorable to the African population. In addition, they made it clear that
                    Zanzibar was going to align itself with Egypt and the Arab world, rather than
                    with the sub-Saharan, black African world, as the Africans wanted.</p>
                <p>On the night of January 11, I had come home in the evening. There was a well
                    attended dance going on in the African quarter, Ng'ambo, where I had taken the
                    children's nanny home, but I saw no sign of anything untoward. At about 2:30 in
                    the morning, the phone rang. I went to the hall and answered it. While I was
                    walking to the phone, I could hear popping sounds. Fritz Picard, my boss, the
                    American charg� d'affaires, was on the line. He told me that something was up
                    and that I should begin to notify Americans to stay home. The firing became more
                    intense. I could hear it quite distinctly. Our next-door neighbor was Ali
                    Muhsin, the leader of the government (not the prime minister, but the de facto
                    leader), and armed revolutionaries had come to get him. So we were very close to
                    the action at the time. As the morning wore on, Fritz, Stu Lillico, and I
                    managed to get in touch with most or all the Americans. They hunkered down.</p>
                <p>It became apparent that the government was no longer in control. At about seven
                    o'clock, Okello got on the radio for the first time and began a series of
                    broadcasts in which he announced that the radio station had been seized, the
                    government had been toppled, and a new government was taking over under the
                    leadership, Okello said, of Abeid Amani Karume, the head of the Afro-Shirazi
                    Party.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>Karume was actually, at that time, in Tanganyika, in Dar es Salaam. Young
                    revolutionaries who had came to his house on the night of the 11thhad told him
                    that he should leave the island because it might be dangerous for him. He was
                    taken to Dar on a boat. Two other leading Zanzibari opposition politicians had
                    also gone to Dar. One of those was Abdulrahman Mohammed, “Babu.” The Americans
                    and the British viewed Babu as a Communist who was exerting a dangerous
                    pro-Communist influence. Just before the 1963 elections, he had broken with the
                    Zanzibar Nationalist Party, of which he had been the Organizing Secretary. Much
                    more radical than the party's other leaders, he founded his own political party,
                    the Umma Party. In the first week of January, the government banned the Umma
                    Party, searched its offices and Babu's house. As a warrant for his arrest was
                    being prepared, he fled the island and went to Dar es Salaam. So the big actors
                    of the opposition were in Dar es Salaam when the revolution took place, which
                    further indicates that they really were not in charge of its inception, as was
                    said later. Okello was. Nevertheless, he announced that Karume would head the
                    government. Karume came back to Zanzibar the day after the revolution, along
                    with Babu and Abdul Kassim Hanga, who would become Karume's vice president.</p>
                <p>To get back to the action that morning, about midmorning Fritz said we should all
                    gather near the airport in case we needed to evacuate. He had been trying to get
                    in touch with the government and with the British authorities, who were still
                    there. Although the British had ceded control to the new government, many
                    British civil servants remained, some of them occupying high administrative
                    positions. Fritz did reach some of these officials, but none was well informed
                    about what was happening. He also tried to communicate with Afro-Shirazi Party
                    leaders, but without success. Thus he did not know the degree to which Americans
                    and other foreigners might be in danger. However, he did not determine at that
                    point that we should evacuate.</p>
                <p>The firing around our house had subsided by the time that Fritz had called me. So
                    when he said we should go to Stu and Helen Lillico's house, which was not far
                    from the airport, I figured it was no safe enough to do so.</p>
                <p>I had gone into town on my bicycle about seven or eight o'clock to see what was
                    going on. I didn't tell Fritz I was going to do this, but I thought it would be
                    interesting. As I approached Ng'ambo, Africans told me I should get out of there
                    because it was dangerous, and indeed, people had been killed in that area
                    earlier that morning. Most of the violence was taking place outside of Zanzibar
                    Town by that time, but it was still dangerous in town.</p>
                <p>Julie and I bundled up the two little girls. I guess I neglected to mention that
                    in September, Julie gave birth to our second daughter, Julianne, at the Karimjee
                    Jivanjee Hospital (soon to become the V.I. Lenin hospital). Julianne was the
                    second American ever to be born in Zanzibar.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>We put the two little girls in the Volkswagen, and I drove from our house, past
                    Ali Muhsin's, to the road that led to the airport. The prison was close to the
                    left side of the road a couple hundred yards farther down. As we approached, a
                    rebel attack on it was taking place. Suddenly we saw just ahead on the right
                    side of the road a group of twenty or thirty men armed with various weapons.
                    When they saw us coming, they turned and pointed their weapons at us. But when
                    they saw who we were, they yelled at us to get out of there and removed the
                    roadblock they had place across the road. We chugged by.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did not turn around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You continued on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I continued driving on, thinking, “Well, that's that,” suppose, if I
                    thought anything! [Laughter]</p>
                <p>We came around a corner less than 200 yards after that, and there behind some
                    palm trees was another group of Africans, another log across the road, and
                    another firefight going on. Once again we were confronted by people with
                    weapons, everything from spears to old rifles. Bullets were actually whizzing
                    over the car, as I stopped it. I could hear them smacking into trees. The
                    rebels, as before, saw that we were foreigners. They told me to drive around the
                    roadblock and get out of there, which I did. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>We went on our way. Once we were clear of that area, I had to stop the car for a
                    moment and steady myself, because it dawned on me how close we had come to
                    losing our lives. Julie was extremely scared. Poor little Susie, who was a year
                    and a half old, was very, very frightened. The baby [laughter] didn't have any
                    problems. She was in her basket at Julie's feet. Susie was on Julie's lap.</p>
                <p>We proceeded, and drove out to the Lillicos' house. There we gathered with the
                    other Americans who had come together to wait and see what happened. Picard, who
                    lived a little further out, had not arrived yet. I talked to him on the phone,
                    and he said to come over, which I did. It was quiet in that area. He and his
                    wife, Shoana, had been packing. After we had talked for a bit, I took Shoana and
                    their three children to the Lillicos'. Fritz followed later. Once at the
                    Lillicos', Fritz, who had been in contact with the embassy in Dar es Salaam by
                    telephone, called again to inform them of the state of play. Even though the
                    rebels controlled everything by that time, they had not cut international
                    telephone service.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>Peering through gaps in the shutters - we had closed the door and shuttered the
                    windows - we watched revolutionaries as they went into nearby Arab houses. We
                    could hear people screaming and saw some killing. It was frightening. The
                    Americans who were gathered with us were very, very apprehensive. At some point
                    in the early afternoon, Fritz decided that he and I should go to the airport to
                    see if we could arrange for an evacuation. We drove the less than one mile to
                    the airport. As we approached it, a car filled with Africans headed towards us,
                    and as it went by us, the long barrel of a large weapon emerged from one of the
                    windows and blasted a cloud of black smoke and I don't know what else. They
                    apparently were trying to give us a fright, not harm us. They succeeded, but
                    nevertheless we went on to the airport control tower, where we talked with the
                    two British air traffic controllers. They pointed out some groups of armed
                    rebels who were standing about in the tall grass just beyond the periphery of
                    the airfield. They told that it was too risky for any aircraft to try to land.
                    Fritz and I left and returned to the Lillico's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hang on a second.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was in control of the airport at this point, Arabs
                        oEuropeans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Europeans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Europeans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: The airport was managed by an Arab professional, Ali Khalifa, and it
                    had a mixed-race staff. The air traffic controllers were British. At this time,
                    when Fritz and I were at the airport, nobody else was around, just the two
                    controllers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any either East African Airways, the small
                        EasAfrican Airways planes, or charter planes around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: No, there were no aircraft there. The East African Airways flight that
                    normally would have come in that morning had been diverted. The prime minister
                    of Zanzibar had been trying to get a shipment of weapons in. He had communicated
                    his request through the controllers, who were in radio contact with the
                    mainland. But the weapons never arrived. Shortly after Fritz and I left the
                    airport, the Africans took it over.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>Our decision then was whether to evacuate or not. Fritz decided that an
                    evacuation was called for. Because it would have to be done by sea, we would
                    need to go into Zanzibar Town and congregate there with the Americans who lived
                    to the north of the city. Once together, we would prepare for an evacuation.
                    Fritz asked me and a fellow named Irv Zolo, who worked for the tracking station,
                    to drive into town to see if the road was safe. We got into my car and headed
                    into town. I was sweating profusely, and not just because it was hot and humid!
                    We both were nervous because we didn't know what would be around each curve in
                    the road. As it happened, we encountered no problem. We saw some results of the
                    revolution. Cars shot up. We saw no bodies. They had been removed already. We
                    went all the way into town. Conditions seemed to be safe enough for the rest of
                    the Americans to make the trip. After we went back, everyone got their things
                    together, and in a convoy of several cars, we drove into town to the English
                    Club, which was right on the beach.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, the Americans who lived on the other side of town had gathered
                    together in one of their houses. After hearing from us about the decision to
                    evacuate from the English Club, they drove toward town in several cars. Unlike
                    us, they did encounter rebels, who stopped them, threatened them, and might have
                    harmed them. But someone with authority interceded, and they were allowed to
                    proceed. On their way in, they saw some grisly sights of Arabs who had been
                    killed and had been mutilated in a very gruesome fashion. So they had first-hand
                    experience with some consequences of the revolution's first day, consequences
                    to-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Africans that threatened those people in those cars,
                        did theknow that they were Americans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, well, they knew that the people were Europeans, aall whites were
                    termed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Europeans? Why would they be sort of angry with
                        Europeans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Well, there was no love on the part of many of these people for
                    foreigners, who led comfortable lives and had all the things that most Africans
                    didn't have. But this was not the problem, for there really was no deep hatred.
                    The rebels carrying weapons were, for the most part, simply ragtag fellows who
                    had no discipline, who had been drinking, or were on something, and they were
                    out of control. They were trying to shake down the Americans. At one point, a
                    baby began to cry, and one of the rebels said to the mother to shut the baby up,
                    or he would kill it. They were pretty nasty. But then someone more reasonable
                    arrived, someone in authority, and he changed the climate of what was going on
                    there. The Americans were allowed to proceed, and reached the English Club
                    without further incident. There were 60 or 65 Americans at the club, and later
                    some Europeans tourists in town joined us.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that includes the people from the tracking station as
                        well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: That's right. The official American community - the small embassy
                    anUSIS staff - along with the tracking station people, and our respective
                    families. With the tourists, there must have been some seventy to eighty people
                    in the hotel as the sun went down. We decided that we would man a command post
                    downstairs. Upstairs, men, women and children got set for the night. Fortunately
                    there was some food in the establishment, and people were able to get something
                    to eat that night. I stayed downstairs and manned the command post all night
                    long, as it turned out, because of an incident that took place in the middle of
                    the night.</p>
                <p>Fritz Picard became very concerned about the fate of Stu Lillico's secretary, a
                    young Zanzibari woman whose name was Fathiya. She was an incredibly beautiful
                    woman, and Fritz was having an affair with her, which I mention because it
                    turned out to be quite germane to what could have happened to the Americans. The
                    revolutionaries were looking for members of the government. One of her relatives
                    was a cabinet minister, a man named Mshangama. She was at his house, which was
                    not very far from the English Club. Fritz had been talking to her on the
                    telephone, and she told him that rebels were coming.</p>
                <p>Fritz came down from upstairs and without telling me and the other fellow who was
                    with me at the command post what he was going to do, he went out into the street
                    and began to make a racket. I didn't know what he was doing. I went out and told
                    him to come back into the English Club, but he persisted. What he was trying to
                    do was to divert the attention of the rebels who might be endangering Fathiya
                    and her family. He wanted to get them to stop what they were doing and come to
                    the English Club instead. He succeeded in doing this because very soon a group
                    of armed men came by and tried to ascertain what he was doing. He bantered with
                    them for a while. Finally they told him to shut up and go back inside, which he
                    did. At that point, I was simply worried about Fritz. I didn't know what he was
                    doing. He then explained, and I was very angry because he had put all of the
                    people in the English Club at risk. Whether or not his diversion saved Fathiya,
                    I'll never know, but at any rate, the rebels did not go into that house. Later
                    that night Fathiya, her mother, and her two children came into the club. Fritz
                    had telephoned her and told her to come there. He met them at the door and took
                    them inside. She was downstairs, and his wife was upstairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, really?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. He arranged for her to stay in a place downstairs away from the
                    Americans who were upstairs, including Shoana. In fact, nobody knew about
                    Fathiya until the end of the following day.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>In the morning, the embassy in Dar es Salaam informed us that approval of the
                    evacuation had been given, and that an American destroyer, the USS Manley, would
                    be coming in to take the Americans off the island. The Manley had been in Kenya
                    at the port of Mombasa on a ship visit when the revolution occurred. The ship
                    was ordered to steam back and forth off the coast of Zanzibar over the horizon
                    until the decision was made that an evacuation could be carried out.</p>
                <p>During the course of that day, Fritz continued to act in a way that disturbed me.
                    For example, when we went out of the English Club onto the beach to talk to
                    rebels, Fritz, at one point, brought his five-year-old son with him. Throughout
                    the day he carried a mug of beer with him, whether he was in the club or
                    outside. It caused a lot of people to raise their eyebrows. It was bizarre
                    behavior. Nevertheless, he showed some very fine qualities later in the day.
                    Certainly his judgment as to the need for the evacuation was not questioned by
                    anyone. The Americans, all of them, were thoroughly frightened and wanted off
                    the island.</p>
                <p>The Manley picked its way into the harbor very slowly about mid-afternoon. A
                    small boat came ashore with Jim Ruchti, who was the deputy chief of mission at
                    the American embassy in Nairobi. He had been in Mombasa for the ship visit. The
                    captain had asked him to accompany the ship to Zanzibar and to give him
                    political advice. Jim received permission to do that. He brought with him a
                    Kenyan cab driver, so there would be somebody who could speak Swahili, listen to
                    the radio to hear local broadcasts, and thereby help keep Ruchti and the captain
                    abreast of what was happening in Zanzibar Town. After the ship had anchored,
                    Ruchti came ashore in the ship's whaleboat with the executive officer and
                    several sailors. They were not permitted, initially, to land until Fritz
                    prevailed upon a group of armed rebels on the beach to permit Ruchti and the
                    executive officer ashore. The sailors had to remain in the boat. Fritz and I
                    took Jim and the exec to the English Club, where we continued to try to contact
                    the revolutionary government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me just ask you a quick question there, interrupt you.
                        Picard and the captain of the ship had not themselves just decided to
                        evacuate the personnel who were at the English Club? Just go ahead and do
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: No. The State Department, Defense Department, and White House had
                    approved Fritz's request for the evacuation. But when the executive officer of
                    the ship came ashore with Jim Ruchti, we had not yet received permission from
                    the rebels. It was only through negotiating with the rebels on the beach that
                    were we able to get those two people off the whaleboat, so that they could wait
                    with us to see whether or not permission for the evacuation would be
                    granted.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Revolutionaries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: That's right. As the afternoon wore on, a phone call from the rebels
                    finally came. It was from Aboud Jumbe, one of the ministers in the new
                    government, who said that he wanted to come over and take Picard to the
                    revolutionary headquarters. In due course he arrived in an open Land Rover with
                    armed people in it. Jumbe himself was heavily armed. Fritz and I, along with Jim
                    Ruchti and the executive officer, got into the Land Rover and were driven to
                    Raha Leo (about a mile away), the site of the radio station and the African
                    community center. Raha Leo was now the command headquarters of the revolution.
                    There was electricity in the air when we neared Raha Leo. Hundreds of Africans
                    who were in a very fierce mood ringed the place, many or most armed with
                    everything from sticks to old swords; an occasional rifle was seen. As we
                    approached the headquarters, better-armed revolutionaries came into sight. They
                    carried police rifles, and a few had automatic weapons. We saw Arab prisoners,
                    some of them bloodied, some lying near the entrance to the revolutionary
                    headquarters, all looking despondent. The crowd was so excited because they knew
                    that at that moment, or soon thereafter, Ali Muhsin, whom they hated, would be
                    brought in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The tension in the air!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, it was so tense as they began to swarm toward the Land Rover,
                    that Aboud Jumbe yelled at them in Swahili (he had a bullhorn) to get back or he
                    would open fire. They obliged, and a way was cleared for us. We got out of the
                    Land Rover and waited for somebody to come out of revolutionary
                    headquarters.</p>
                <p>After a while, a figure emerged, a man dressed in a semi-military uniform. He had
                    on dark shorts and a dark blue shirt, a peaked cap, knee socks in the British
                    style. He approached us, went up to the executive officer, pulled a revolver out
                    of his holster, stuck it right at the exec, either in his ribs as I remember it,
                    or in his face as Jim Ruchti remembered it, and said, “How do you do? I'm John
                    Okello.” With that, he put his revolver back in the holster and said there was
                    going to be some target practice behind revolutionary headquarters. Would we
                    like to join in? Well, figuring that the targets might well be some of the
                    captured Arabs, we declined.</p>
                <p>He escorted us into Raha Leo. We went up the stairs into a meeting room, where
                    after another wait we were ushered into the room. Sitting there behind a table
                    with Okello were Abeid Karume, leader of the Afro-Shirazi Party and now the
                    president of the new government, Babu, Hanga, and several others.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back from Dar es Salaam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Back from Dar es Salaam. Karume had come back to Zanzibar by boat
                    early that morning with Babu and Hanga. The British high commissioner had met
                    with them just before we did, and as he left we entered. The discussion began.
                    Fritz, first of all, told Okello (who had put his revolver on the table with the
                    barrel pointing at Fritz) that we would not negotiate at gunpoint. Okello made
                    no reply, but picked up and reholstered his weapon. He didn't say much during
                    the ensuing discussion, in which Fritz made the request for an evacuation. Babu
                    replied angrily, so did Hanga; Karume was uncomfortable. They were angry that
                    the Americans had brought in this warship. And it seemed to us, as we thought
                    about it a bit later, that they didn't know whether the Manley might open fire.
                    In any case, they really didn't care for the evacuation. They didn't want to see
                    it happen, but they agreed to it, fearing there might be consequences
                    otherwise.</p>
                <p>Finally, Karume indicated that he would not oppose the request. Thehe turned to
                    Okello and said, “It's your decision.”</p>
                <p>Okello sort of shrugged and said, “All right.”</p>
                <p>This made it clear to us there that Okello was indeed of great importance. I say
                    this because later on there were those belittled Okello's role in the
                    revolution. In fact, the official history of the revolution barely mentions him.
                    But he was the force that pulled it off. Weeks later, others with more political
                    sagacity took control.</p>
                <p>We returned to the English Club. Fritz went off to the hotels to pick up those
                    tourists who were still there. While Ruchti and the executive officer went down
                    to the boat to get the crew ready for the operation and to notify the captain
                    what had happened at Raha Leo, Lillico and I met with the Americans, who waiting
                    for us on the club's upper porch, which overlooked the beach. Earlier, we had
                    stipulated that women and children, regardless of nationality, would go first.
                    However, now a couple of the Americans, tracking station employees, said,
                    “Uh-uh, Americans first, foreigners second.” Stu and I said [laughter], “Not on
                    your life! Women and children first.” And we made that stick. With Fritz now
                    back, everyone who wanted to go was at the club, and the whaleboat and another
                    boat, the captain's gig, began taking the evacuees out to the destroyer. The sun
                    had gone down and it soon grew very dark. I took Julie and the babies down to
                    the boat with the few possessions that she had brought, mainly things for the
                    children and some clothes. We said goodbye, and I kissed her and the two little
                    girls. She was fearful, as she said later in letters to her parents and to mine,
                    that she would never see me again. I had no such thoughts, myself! [Laughter] I
                    was having too much of an interesting time! Off she and the children went into
                    the gloom. We had set up some portable lights from the ship on the beach, but
                    their beams didn't carry much beyond 30 or 40 yards out to sea. The boats would
                    disappear into the darkness as they went out to the ship. After all the evacuees
                    were aboard, the Manley sailed to Dar es Salaam.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me interrupt you again for a second.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were personnel from any other consulates taken off, the
                        Britisfor example?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: No. There were no other diplomatic establishments, just the British
                    and the Americans at that time. The British had not made a decision to evacuate.
                    They considered it, but had not yet decided. There was some criticism of the
                    American decision to evacuate, but Fritz had sound reasons for doing what he
                    did. (1) We had no idea that the word was out not to harm foreigners. (2) We
                    were unable to get in touch with the revolutionaries. We didn't know whether the
                    violence would get worse, or whether it would subside. (3) There had been
                    animosity shown toward the Americans by some of the very people who carried out
                    the revolution. They had protested the presence in Zanzibar of what they termed
                    the American rocket base and demanded its removal. There was a lot of hostile
                    propaganda directed against America in that month after independence. The Manley
                    arrived in Dar es Salaam harbor that night, but couldn't go in through the
                    channel, which was very narrow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Including yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Oh, no, no! Pardon me! I forgot to mention that Fritz and I stayed. We
                    had agreed that somebody should stay behind to look after the embassy and the
                    property of Americans. Washington said that if we wanted to stay we could, so
                    that left the two of us on the island. The next day, in Dar es Salaam the
                    Americans disembarked from the destroyer. My family and Fritz's family remained
                    in Dar until a week later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Fritz's girlfriend?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: She was there. Everybody [laughter] saw her on thManley.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She went over to Dar as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>Fritz and I then went home that night and drank a lot of beer. I had a beer or
                    two, but by that time I'd been up for over 48 hours and was very tired. I went
                    home to my now lonely house. By the way, we were no longer in the stable. We had
                    moved two months earlier to my predecessor's house in another part of town, a
                    much nicer home.</p>
                <p>The next day, Fritz and I were told by the revolutionaries not to leave our
                    respective houses, but later in the day we were given permission to go about our
                    business. My Swahili came in to very good use, either that day or the next. We
                    were driving from Fritz's place to the embassy when we came upon a group of
                    armed men, who yelled in Swahili, “Simana,” which meant, “Stop!”Fritz didn't
                    speak Swahili; I did. I said, “Fritz, stop the car” which he did. [Laughter]
                    Otherwise, he would have kept going and we might have been shot at.</p>
                <p>By the way, my Swahili (and I'm talking to Nick who studied Swahilwith me)-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A classmate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: That's right...was very useful. I formed a friendship with Karume as a
                    result, because I was the only American who spoke Swahili and my Swahili was
                    getting better and better all of the time. We carried out our conversations in
                    Swahili. I was very deferential to him; Fritz was not. Fritz, unfortunately, was
                    a bit patronizing with Karume, and that came back to haunt him, as I'll
                    explain.</p>
                <p>On the morning of January 16, four days after the revolution, we were at the
                    embassy. Fritz received a telephone call from the British high commissioner, who
                    somewhat testily said, “Some of your people are causing a problem down at the
                    port, reporters, your people, Americans.” He said they were a matter of “grave
                    embarrassment.” So Fritz told me to go there, which I did. At the boat landing,
                    I encountered several armed men who were gathered at the top of a concrete sea
                    wall from which steps led down to the water. A couple of British colonial port
                    officials also were there. I could see the top of a dhow's mast. After
                    explaining who I was and why I had come, I was allowed go to the edge of the sea
                    wall. I saw that there were seven men in the boat. We talked, and I learned that
                    they were American, British, and Canadian newspapermereporters for Time,
                    Newsweek, The New York Herald Tribune, a Canadian paper, and a British papeand
                    an Indian photographer for Life magazine. So they weren't just Americans, were
                    not, in the words of the High Commissioner, “your people” only. They had sailed
                    in the dhow from the mainland, arriving in Zanzibar the previous night.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>They started asking me questions. Foolishly I answered. At that point a rifle was
                    pointed right at my face, and I was told to “Shut up!” So I stopped talking,
                    [laughter] the better part of valor! Some authorities from the revolutionary
                    government joined these armed people at dockside. They said that the men in the
                    boat were spies and we were going to be taken to revolutionary headquarters. Off
                    we went. I tried to explain to the rebels who I was. They couldn't care less,
                    nor did they accept that these were just newspaper people.</p>
                <p>We had been held at Raha Leo for several hours when Fritz showed up. He finally
                    had found out where we were and what the problem was, and had talked to a
                    minister in the government. Karume was away. He had gone to Dar es Salaam that
                    day. The minister said, “Well, sure. Let these people go.” Fritz told us the
                    good news, and he and I drove the journalists to the Zanzibar Hotel, where they
                    got rooms and then went off about their business.</p>
                <p>But suspicions were high about these people. Some of them had U.S. Defense
                    Department press cards, and they showed them when asked for an ID
                    (identification) card. The name of one of the reporters was Conley, Robert
                    Conley. That sounded like “colonel.” So the rebels had this Colonel Robert, and
                    they had Defense Department ID cards. Spies, you know! It really rang a bell
                    with some of these less-than-sophisticated rebels.</p>
                <p>When Karume returned late that afternoon, or early that evening, he was told
                    about the reporters and the suspicious about them. He was also given some of
                    their notes, which had been taken from them and which were not too complimentary
                    about the revolution. Karume was angry, and he went to the Zanzibar Hotel to
                    confront them. Picard was with them. The minister who had allowed these fellows
                    to go about their business happened to be a political enemy of Karume, even
                    though he was in the cabinet. When Karume saw Picard with his political enemy
                    and the correspondents, he was furious. Babu, who was with him, and another
                    government official, who had no love for Fritz, egged Karume on. In essence they
                    said, “You know, these people are up to no good. Picard has interfered.” Karume
                    bought that and angrily ordered Picard, at gunpoint, to be taken to his
                    house.</p>
                <p>I was over at the embassy at that time, composing a long classified cable, using
                    a primitive system of those days called a “one-time pad,” and as, Nick
                    [laughter], you'd know, it was a very laborious task! It took me a couple of
                    hours to encrypt the message. It was dark outside when I locked up, left the
                    embassy, and started across the square - Kelele Square - to Cable and Wireless
                    to deliver my telegram for transmission. In the darkness, in the middle of the
                    square, I came upon Karume and a gaggle of fellows with weapons. Karume asked me
                    what I was doing.</p>
                <p>I said, “I'm taking a message over to be sent.”</p>
                <p>He said, “No, I can't allow that!” He told me what had happened. He said that he
                    had arrested Picard, that Picard had done something bad and would be expelled
                    from the island, and that I would have to be placed under arrest, too.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>He ordered four of the armed men to get in my car, the VW, and accompany me. I
                    drove toward my house with the barrel of a rifle in the back of my neck, not
                    intentionally, but it was a bit disconcerting! They didn't stop at my house, but
                    instead took me to Picard's. There I spent the night with Fritz, who was
                    drinking heavily. The next day, a chartered plane came over from Dar. Fritz was
                    placed on the airplane, along with some of his possessions and the Lillico's
                    dog, which had been left behind, and off he went. I was at the airport with him
                    and breathed a sigh of relief when the plane left, because I had been worried
                    that his behavior since the onset of revolution might lead to his harm. There
                    were some Chinese at the airport taking pictures of Fritz's expulsion. Babu and
                    some of his people were also present.</p>
                <p>Now Babu was a factor to be reckoned with. He was not an African. He didn't
                    belong to the Afro-Shirazi Party, but his followers, many of whom had been
                    trained in Cuba or other Communist countries, had automatic weapons. They had
                    more firepower than Okello's people, and therefore were a factor to be reckoned
                    with. Babu was the Zanzibar government's foreign minister. I chatted with him,
                    and we agreed we would talk later on. I was told to go back to my own house,
                    which I did.</p>
                <p>That began a period of five weeks, during which I was the only American in
                    Zanzibar, pretty heady stuff, [laughter], a junior Foreign Service officer in
                    charge of the embassy! In the course of those five weeks, I had a number of
                    adventures in trying to protect American property, failing in some cases because
                    looters had come, encountering looters at one property and chasing after them,
                    foolishly, on my bicycle, and capturing one of them, only to find that he was
                    just a kid. If I turned him in he would be executed, so I let him go, and warned
                    him not to do that anymore.</p>
                <p>I managed to communicate by telephone with the embassy in Dar es Salaam. I was
                    not given diplomatic privileges. I could send nothing out by diplomatic pouch
                    and could send cables only if they were not encrypted and were approved by a
                    government censor at Cable and Wireless. Now and then, the censor didn't like my
                    choice of words and refused to all the message to be transmitted.</p>
                <p>I formed a relationship with Karume, and also with Babu, who was a very charming
                    guy, a militant left-winger, to say the least, and very shrewd, very
                    intelligent. Karume was a stolid man, not nearly as bright as Babu, but a man of
                    very real native intelligence. I don't mean to use that term in a derogatory
                    sense at all. He was a very able man in many ways, but impressionable and
                    unsophisticated. As time would go by the results of that would be harmful to
                    Zanzibar.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>Occasionally I got a classified message out by taking it over to the British, who
                    had been given the permission to use their classified pouch. Twice, at the
                    airport I met American officials who were on a flight from Dar to Nairobi via
                    Zanzibar. I was allowed to go out and talk to them. I slipped each of them an
                    envelope with a message in it.</p>
                <p>My time was largely taken up with looking after the American property, trying to
                    find out what was going on, dealing with the revolutionary government, and
                    reporting as well as I could. By mid-February, it was clear that the
                    revolutionary government was getting fed up with the lack of recognition from
                    the British and the Americans. Concern about Zanzibar in the American government
                    reached the highest level, President Johnson, and in the British government at
                    its highest level, Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home. This was extraordinary when
                    you think about it. Zanzibar was seen as a precursor of revolution for Africa,
                    as a Communist foothold could spread into the continent. The Chinese communists,
                    the Soviets, and East Germans had established embassies (which grew to be quite
                    large) and had begun arranging for military and economic aid. Communist
                    diplomats, technicians, and military trainers began to come to Zanzibar in
                    relatively large numbers.</p>
                <p>The British were dithering. They didn't want to recognize a government that had
                    come to power by force of arms. Moreover, they didn't like this government's
                    pro-Communist or apparent pro-Communist leanings. So the British waited despite
                    the urgings of Tanganyikan Prime Minister Julius Nyerere that they grant
                    recognition to the new government of Zanzibar. Washington followed the British
                    lead. By a month or so after the revolution, the Zanzibaris were out of
                    patience. On the 19th of February, I was summoned to revolutionary headquarters,
                    where the British high commissioner had arrived just before me. Karume told us
                    that because the U.S. and UK (United Kingdom) had not recognized his government,
                    we would have to go; otherwise, the people might rise up and do harm to us or to
                    the government. Well, that was an exaggeration, but we were given 24 hours to
                    leave.</p>
                <p>From the embassy, I called the American ambassador to Tanganyika, William
                    Leonhart, in Dar es Salaam and informed him of what had happened. Then I went
                    back to burning classified documents, which I had been doing for several days,
                    using a small potbellied stove. Leonhart tried that day to convince Nyerere to
                    influence Karume to postpone my expulsion, but without success. That evening,
                    the ambassador called me. Passing a message from Washington, he said I should
                    see Karume if I could and ask him to delay the expulsion for at least
                    twenty-four hours. I should tell him that a U.S. official from Washington had
                    just arrived in Dar and could come over the next day to talk to him about
                    recognition. I managed to get through to Karume, who said I could come see him.
                    He didn't agree to the proposal but left the door open. After another exchange
                    between Leonhart and me, and a message from Washington for Karume, which arrived
                    at seven o'clock the following morning, Karume agreed to receive Leonhart and
                    the man from Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>At midmorning, Ambassador Leonhart and Frank Carlucci, a Foreign Service officer,
                    came to Zanzibar in a small chartered aircraft. I met them and went with them to
                    see Karume.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Carlucci doing in Dar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Frank had been in the Congo, where he had acquired a reputation as an
                    exceptionally able Foreign Service officer. He was the embassy's troubleshooter
                    in the Congo. After the Congo and before coming to Zanzibar, he had a job in the
                    State Department-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when I saw him, he was assistant desk officer for
                        the Congunder Charlie Whitehouse.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was '63.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. Frank was well regarded by Joe Palmer, the Assistant Secretary of
                    State for African Affairs and by Charlie Whitehouse, and by everybody else. It
                    had been decided that Frank would be the new charg� d'affaires in Zanzibar. He
                    came with a letter from President Johnson that indicated recognition would be
                    coming soon. Frank and Leonhart tried to convince Karume that with recognition
                    just around the corner, it would be much better if he didn't throw me off the
                    island. By the way, the whole Revolutionary Council, which included all the wild
                    men along with some of the more able and moderate Zanzibari Africans who were in
                    the cabinet, were at this meeting. The discussion went on for a couple of hours,
                    but in the end Karume and the Council rejected the American proposal. Karume,
                    when he said goodbye, said, “If you come back, if recognition takes place, and
                    you come back, Mr. Carlucci, we'll have a parade in your honor.” So with that,
                    Frank and Ambassador Leonhart returned to Dar es Salaam.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>I went back to the embassy to finish burning the classified materials. I had just
                    started when there was a pounding on the front door. Ali Mafoudh, the head of
                    the newly created special police force, demanded to come into the embassy. When
                    I refused him entry, he said he would have to take me in custody. He drove me to
                    State House, the seat of the government. An official there told Mafoudh to take
                    me back to the embassy and not interfere with me. After I did some burning, I
                    went home for a quick lunch. When I returned, the officer in charge of the
                    soldiers who had surrounded the building said I could not reenter it. When I
                    argued with him, he told me a government official wanted to see me and he drove
                    me to a government office. I was taken to the office of Abdul Azziz Twala, one
                    of the more militant members of the cabinet. Unbeknownst to me, an argument had
                    preceded my arrival. Some of the people there wanted to kill me. At least that's
                    what a man named Mohammed Ali Foum, who was there at the time and later became a
                    diplomat in Tanzanian diplomatic service, told me years afterward. We met at the
                    United Nations one day, and he told me this. I don't know if it's true, but he
                    swore it was. He said that after some argument, it was decided that killing me
                    would cause too many problems. At any rate, when I got there, Twala simply told
                    me to return to the embassy, then go home and get ready to leave later that day.
                    This was-</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: No, to the embassy. After using an ax to demolish the code machine,
                    which didn't work and we'd never used, I started burning papers again. I soon
                    realized that I couldn't destroy all the classified papers using just the stove,
                    so I got one of the two or three destruction kits that were stored on the same
                    floor as the walk-in vault, where we kept the classified files. Each kit was a
                    heavy cardboard cylindrical drum, about three and a half feet high and two feet
                    in diameter, the size of a large garbage can. It contained a bag, or bags, I
                    can't remember, of inflammable chemicals in granular form and a magnesium
                    igniter. I put in papers, threw some of the chemical stuff on them, put in more
                    papers, more chemicals, until all the papers were in the container. With
                    everything now ready, I then dropped in the igniter. It worked like a hand
                    grenade. You pull the pin, drop it in, and whoosh! A sheet of fire shot up. The
                    heat of the fire was so intense that had I not kept the vault door open, I would
                    have been incinerated. The pressure that resulted was so strong that to close
                    the vault door, which I left open, I had to put my feet against of the opposite
                    wall of the narrow hallway outside the vault and use my leg muscles to get the
                    door closed. I began to wonder, “What the hell have I done?”</p>
                <p>Knowing that the troops outside would see smoke coming through the small open
                    barred space in the vault, I went outside and talked to the guy in charge. Sure
                    enough, black smoke could be seen pouring through the opening. He asked me what
                    I was doing. I said, “Oh, I'm just burning a few papers. It's normal for us to
                    do that, you know.” And he accepted it, and I went back inside. I really
                    thought, “How am I going to explain [laughter] to Washington that I burned down
                    the embassy? Luckily the vault was built of steel-reinforced concrete. Had it
                    not been, the walls would have buckled, and the fire might well have spread. But
                    it was contained in the vault, and I didn't burn down the embassy.</p>
                <p>Q: This is all very interesting because your evacuation certainly wasn't the last
                    and won't be the last. But one of the lessons learned perhaps is that when you
                    use these destruction kits, you should use them outdoors?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Absolutely!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or on a roof, or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Absolutely! They didn't have directions on them. A couple of weeks or
                    so later, I sent what we called an “operations memorandum” to Washington
                    describing in detail what had happened and urging the Department to put a label
                    on the destruction kits, “Do not use indoors under any circumstances!” I'm told
                    that that memorandum made the rounds in the department and [laughter] got a lot
                    of laughs.</p>
                <p>I went home, packed a suitcase, and waited to be taken to the airporfor the
                    flight to Dar es Salaam.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On an East African Airways flight?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, a regularly scheduled flight. I was met at the airport in Dar,
                    taken to the embassy where I was debriefed. I wrote a report before I left the
                    next day for Nairobi, where Julie and the children were. They had been in Dar es
                    Salaam but had been evacuated from there after a mutiny by the Tanganyikan army
                    had almost toppled the government of Julius Nyerere and had brought considerable
                    violence to Dar es Salaam. During that violence, Fritz began to relive the
                    Zanzibar revolution, and he had to be medically evacuated. He'd been under great
                    stress and was as tight as a drum. After medical treatment in the States, he was
                    medically cleared and resumed his career. It had been damaged, however, and
                    ended after his next overseas assignment had not given him the kind of
                    efficiency report he needed for a promotion.</p>
                <p>I flew to Nairobi and spent two or three days there. I had the flu, but didn't
                    feel too bad. I got a call from Frank Carlucci in Dar telling me to come back,
                    that recognition had been granted. He and I would be going over to Zanzibar
                    right away. So I flew to Dar, and, with Ambassador Leonhart, Frank and I flew
                    over to the island. There was no parade to welcome us. Karume, who was visibly
                    pleased, received us at State House, and Frank read to him the formal note of
                    recognition. Leonhart returned to Dar es Salaam. Frank and I opened the embassy.
                    The first thing we did was clean up the vault, which was covered by a thick
                    coating of slimy dark brown [laughter] soot. While Frank, his secretary, Lynne
                    Derzo, and I were doing that, I almost passed out. I was done in by a bad case
                    of flu, fatigue, and maybe weight loss. I had lost a lot of weight when I was
                    alone on the island, cooking for myself or being fed by friends. Anyway, I was
                    simply...</p>
                <p>Q: Exhausted!PETTERSON: Yes. So I went back to Nairobi, spent about a week with
                    Julie and the children before going back to Zanzibar to resume my job working
                    with my new boss, the charg� d'affaires of the American embassy, Frank
                    Carlucci.</p>
                <p>I began a very good year with Frank Carlucci, one of the most able, dedicated
                    people I've known anywhere, certainly an outstanding Foreign Service Officer.
                    Frank was very generous in giving me free rein to do whatever I wanted to do in
                    the way of political reporting. Under Fritz I had been confined to lower-level
                    officials and labor reporting. But Frank gave me, as I said, free rein.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>I learned a lot from him by his example. He was an excellent reporter. He got
                    out, beat the bushes, met people. He was charming. He got people to trust him.
                    He dealt with people who were essentially hostile to us at that time, befriended
                    them, and got a lot out of it. He knew what was going on in Zanzibar before he'd
                    been there very long. A measure of his dedication is shown by the fact that
                    whereas he spoke no Swahili when he got there, one year later, by taking
                    tutoring from an Anglican nun and listening to tapes, Frank got a three-three in
                    Swahili when he was tested at the Foreign Service Institute.</p>
                <p>Q: Let me just interrupt you there to say, you know, obviously, you have a lot of
                    respect and admiration for Carlucci. But I think it might be interesting for
                    researchers, as well as journalists and other people who are going to use this
                    interview, for you to describe briefly what the characteristics are, in your
                    opinion, of an outstanding American diplomat. What is it that Carlucci
                    represented, in your opinion?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: First of all, he had extraordinary intelligence, coupled with very
                    good common sense, and an outgoing nature. He knew how to get along with
                    Africans. He was sensitive to their culture. He had no false pretensions. He was
                    an excellent writer, had superior analytical skills, and was a superb manager.
                    He knew how to delegate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What makes a good reporting officer, Don?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Somebody who's willing to get out of the office, travel around the
                    country, to do whatever is necessary to get information, to establish a rapport
                    with people so they will talk to you. You collect intelligence from people whom
                    you meet and process it through whatever abilities you have. You learn to sift
                    out good information from bad. I believe, too, that, like Frank, the best
                    officers are very industrious and dedicated. Frank worked long, hard hours and
                    gave a great deal of thought to his work. He also (maybe this isn't a quality of
                    a great reporter or necessarily a successful Foreign Service officer, but to me
                    it's something very important) cared about people, the people who worked with
                    him, and he showed that. He got their loyalty, and he got a lot out of them. He
                    had all the qualities that would later propel him to high offices in the U.S.
                    government, including secretary of defense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, so there you are in Zanzibar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: That's right. We are behind the bamboo curtain, as we said in those
                    days, or the clove curtain, as some joked, cloves being Zanzibar's principal
                    export. Frank set out to meet and establish a relationship with as many people
                    as possible in the government and other areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but this story is about you and not about Frank.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: [Laughter] Yes, but-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were doing the same thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, I was very happy to be able to start becoming a political
                    reporter because it was what I had wanted to do, and I had not been able to do
                    it either in Mexico or much in Zanzibar before the revolution. I now got out and
                    about, established whatever contacts I could. It was very difficult because we
                    were under suspicion. Sometimes we were under surveillance. People were afraid
                    to see us. We could not entertain Zanzibaris; nobody would come to our house. So
                    we didn't have the usual kind of social opportunities to meet people and get
                    information.</p>
                <p>But we could wander around and go to people's offices and other places where we
                    could meet people who might give us information of the kind we needed in order
                    to inform Washington what was happening in Zanzibar, which had become (in the
                    eyes of Washington and London) a bastion of Communism. The Chinese brought in
                    more people - military trainers, agriculturists, and embassy staff - as did the
                    Soviets and the East Germans. The East Germans were delighted to have a
                    diplomatic establishment in Zanzibar. Before getting Zanzibar's recognition,
                    they had not been recognized by any other countries except communist
                    countries.</p>
                <p>Q: But those three countries are among the three most difficult countries for a
                    Western diplomat to observe and gather information about.</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: True. We were we trying to report not only on what was happening in
                    Zanzibar among the Zanzibaris, but, more important from Washington's standpoint,
                    on what the Chinese, East Germans, and Soviets were doing. Other communist
                    countries were also represented in Zanzibar. Cuba, for example, the Czechs, the
                    Poles, North Vietnamese, Bulgarians, you name them; they were all there. It was
                    a great place to be as a young reporting officer in the Cold War days.</p>
                <p>We set about our work. As I said, I learned a lot from Frank and began doing
                    political reporting. I was also the administrative officer and the consular
                    officer. Our embassy began to grow. Suddenly we were in the front lines of the
                    East-West struggle and a place, at least for some more months to come,
                    considered to be very important in the eyes of the State Department and others
                    in Washington.</p>
                <p>Q: When you say that you began to grow, for example, did the USIA (United States
                    Information Agency), USIS send any people? Were there any CIA (Central
                    Intelligence Agency) people there?</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: USIS reestablished their office, and an officer came to run it. The
                    CIA did come in. This was the major factor in the growth of the embassy, as you
                    can imagine. Zanzibar was very fertile ground for the CIA, the KGB (Komitet
                    Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti, Committee for State Security, USSR), and other
                    counterparts of these intelligence services.</p>
                <p>So yes, we now a CIA presence. We had a station chief and his staff, which
                    included communications personnel, an administrative person, and a secretary.
                    The State Department side began to grow a little, too, as we got another
                    secretary and an administrative assistant, who took the admin burden off of me.
                    So from a four-person U.S. mission, we expanded to about a dozen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the NASA tracking station people come back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Momentarily. The Karume government decided in April that the tracking
                    station would have to close down. The decision came despite a report that had
                    been issued just before the revolution by a Swedish diplomat whom the previous
                    government had asked to assess the station. He attested to the peaceful purposes
                    of the manned space program (which indeed they were). Pressure to close the
                    station decision had been building. It was being exerted by Communist diplomats,
                    as well as by people within the government, including but not limited to Babu
                    and other leftists. Whether they believed it or not, I don't know, but some
                    continued to call the tracking station an American rocket base. Karume summoned
                    Frank and told him the tracking station would have to be dismantled. So a few of
                    the Project Mercury people and the NASA representative came back and very
                    quickly dismantled the station, much faster than Karume had thought it would
                    take. He was pleased by the professional way they did this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be about mid '64?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: No, we're still in the early part of '64.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Early part of '64? Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. By this time, Okello had been eased out of power. He was simply
                    not up to the skills of people like Babu and Karume. He had embarrassed them
                    during the revolution. He had been on the radio giving very inflammatory
                    announcements about who would be killed and who would be boiled in oil and all
                    sorts of grisly comments, which embarrassed some Zanzibaris and terrified
                    others. But as much as Karume and others in the Afro-Shirazi Party leadership
                    and Babu and his followers feared Okello for a time, they must had known that
                    they would be able to get rid of him at some point. He had no political base.
                    All he had was some mainly very unsophisticated people with weapons. Okello was
                    not clever enough to see that disarming these people, which Karume had inveigled
                    him into doing, and putting them into new military units would remove his base
                    of power. Sometime in March, he went over to the mainland, and when he came back
                    to Zanzibar, Karume met him at the airport and said, “You can't get off the
                    plane.” Karume flew with him back to Dar es Salaam, where he stayed for a while
                    before being ejected from Tanganyika.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where had he come from originally?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: He was a Ugandan-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Who had gone to Kenya when he was a young man, worked as a laborer,
                    then as a mason, and learned construction skills that he took with him to Pemba
                    in 1959.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pemba is a small island north of Zanzibar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. Zanzibar was composed of the islands of Zanzibaand Pemba.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So he went back to Uganda?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: He ended up in Uganda. From Dar es Salaam, he went to Kenya, where he
                    was expelled. Nobody wanted this man around. He had a fearsome reputation.
                    People were afraid that wherever he went, he might foment a revolution. He had
                    trouble with immigration authorities and was either expelled from places or put
                    in jail. Finally he returned to Uganda, where he was imprisoned. In 1971, he was
                    seen with Idi Amin shortly after Amin came to power. Then John Okello
                    disappeared from the face of the earth, no doubt killed by Amin.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>In the meantime, Karume was concerned about Babu and his people, who had close
                    relations with the Chinese and who were very well armed. Karume feared that they
                    wanted to take over the revolution. So did Julius Nyerere on the mainland.
                    Nyerere and Karume decided that they would unify their two countries to undercut
                    Babu. This they did, telling only a very few trusted advisors. Their decision,
                    when announced, came as a complete surprise. Babu was out of town. As Zanzibar's
                    foreign minister, he was in Pakistan on an official visit. When he heard about
                    the union, he was furious. He later denied that he was upset and said,
                    untruthfully, that he knew in advance about the plan for union. When he came
                    back, he found a new political dispensation. The government of Tanzania, the
                    name chosen for the country later, was in the process of being formed. Babu was
                    given a post in the Tanzanian government, which was located in Dar es Salaam,
                    since it was the new country's capital. In time, other Zanzibaris who were
                    deemed as possible security threats were transferred to mainland jobs or sent
                    off as diplomats. Babu was effectively stripped of his political power. From
                    then on, he was bitter toward Karume and, especially, Nyerere. With Babu's
                    departure from Zanzibar, Karume's power increased.</p>
                <p>The marriage between Tanganyika and Zanzibar was a marriage of convenience. It
                    had strains from the very beginning. As time went on the relationship became
                    more strained as Zanzibar wanted to run its own foreign affairs, have its own
                    military, and control its own foreign exchange. But the union continued. Nyerere
                    wanted it and Karume wanted it, if on his own terms.</p>
                <p>Q: Let me ask you, Don. In Tanganyika at the time of independence, there was a
                    small Indian minority as well as a few Arabs. If there were also these
                    minorities in Zanzibar, what happened to them?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: The population, as I mentioned earlier, included about 250,000
                    Africans. A high percentage of them were them people from the mainland who had
                    come over to pick cloves and then had stayed and had established their families
                    in Zanzibar. Some of the Africans were longer-term inhabitants, many of whom,
                    especially those living in Pemba, called themselves Shirazis, claiming that they
                    were descended from the Shiraz people of Iran. In addition to the Africans,
                    Zanzibar had 50,000 Arabs, and about 20,000 Asians of Pakistani and Indian
                    origin. During the revolution, some 5,000 people were killed. Almost all of
                    these were Arabs. That's one tenth of the Arab population. By the time I left
                    the island near the end of 1965, the number of Arabs was less than 25,000. Those
                    who remained had no place in the power structure whatsoever. The Asian
                    population was also down by half or more by that time. As the government of
                    Zanzibar became more and more repressive, Asians wanted out, and those who
                    could, left. Karume, despite a lot of good qualities, became increasingly
                    dictatorial. I didn't see the worst of it during my time and I got along very
                    well with him, as did Frank. But subsequent to our time there, he became more
                    and more erratic, more and more dictatorial. Eventually he was assassinated, and
                    a more moderate man, Aboud Jumbe, whom I mentioned earlier, became Zanzibar's
                    president.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>Frank and I settled down for a long siege of working in the Cold War trenches.
                    Julie and the children came back in March. In April, because of anti-American
                    demonstrations, they went back to Dar for a short time, returning after the
                    demonstrations were ended and any possible threat was over.</p>
                <p>We had a wonderful life in Zanzibar when all the hullabaloo was over. We had a
                    small circle of friends - small because we couldn't mix with Zanzibaris. The
                    Revolutionary Council had become very anti-Western and prohibited Zanzibaris
                    from having anything to do with the Americans and British. Even cabinet members
                    were afraid to associate with us. So our social circle was limited to the small
                    British community that remained, members of the British high commission, the
                    Americans, and a few other foreigners, including some Africans. We had a
                    tight-knit little community. We did a lot of socializing. The beaches were
                    lovely. A number of us took our children to a beach just about every Sunday.
                    Zanzibar was a nice place to be, from that standpoint, and a very fascinating
                    place to be because of what was occurring there, as we watched the influx of
                    Communists and observed how things were playing out. We tried to influence
                    Karume and others in the government to take a more moderate stance, and to be
                    more truly nonaligned. We finally succeeded in that. Frank made a lot of inroads
                    and a lot of progress before he had to leave the island.</p>
                <p>Q: I wanted to ask. This is a good time. Were there any AID (United States Agency
                    for International Development) or Peace Corps people on the island when you were
                    there?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: No Peace Corps or AID. But we had an AID project, and AID officers
                    from Dar es Salaam came over occasionally, or I would go over there to confer
                    with them. The project was the construction and equipping of a secondary manual
                    arts school that would turn out artisans, technicians, which the island very
                    much needed. Karume looked upon the project with great favor. A Zanzibari
                    resident, a South African architect, designed the school to our specifications.
                    The project, which cost about a million dollars, was appropriate to Zanzibar's
                    needs and was not at all grandiose or ill conceived. Within a decade, however,
                    it failed. After the school was turned over to the Zanzibari authorities to run
                    by themselves, they didn't handle it well at all, and it deteriorated physically
                    as well as academically.</p>
                <p>Q: While you were there, then, this AID project was one of the tools of American
                    diplomacy. Were there any other tools that you had to try to influence the
                    Zanzibari government?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Well, the tool of rational discourse with the Zanzibaris. The agency
                    has its own way of making friends, and some money was passed around. Whether
                    that that produced any lasting positive results, I don't know. Our USIS library
                    was very popular with Zanzibaris, especially young people. But its very success
                    as a tool of our diplomacy was its undoing. At different times in the coming
                    year and a half, our opponents succeeded in bringing trumped up charges against
                    two USIS officers and getting them expelled.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>Another thing we had going for us was the mistakes made by the communists
                    themselves. The East Germans promised to build a massive housing projects,
                    enough housing for all the Africans in Ng'ambo. We're talking about 40,000 or
                    50,000 people. In the end the Germans built some apartments that were unsuitable
                    to the culture of the Zanzibari people, who didn't want to live in large blocks
                    of flats. They wanted a house that would be their own. The Chinese imported a
                    lot of commercial goods, some of which were shoddy. For example, they brought in
                    some talcum powder, which sat in a warehouse and congealed in the heat and
                    humidity. The Soviets didn't come through with the kind of aid they
                    promised.</p>
                <p>I don't want to give a picture that the Communists really blew it. Because of
                    their mistakes, they may have lost some of the luster they had gained right
                    after the revolution, but overall their aid was welcomed. The Chinese gave a
                    cash grant of one million pounds, which the Zanzibar government sorely needed.
                    Although the Chinese rice production of the communal farms was hardly bountiful,
                    Zanzibar's leaders seemed favorably impressed by it. And the Chinese brought in
                    medical personnel to work in the hospital. Soviet military advisors, as well as
                    Chinese, continued to train Zanzibari soldiers. Both countries provided more
                    arms, equipment and ammunition. And the East Germans brought in technicians of
                    various kinds, and teachers as well. They also delivered an armed patrol boat
                    and some fishing boats.</p>
                <p>As for our AID project, we never promised what we couldn't deliver, and I think
                    that set well with Karume. He was impressed by what we did. He wanted to have a
                    balanced relationship with East and West - very hard to do in those days. He
                    seemed to come to the conclusion that we were there not to do him in, but to
                    work with him. Even though he had been very much angered and upset because of
                    the delay of our recognition, in time we developed a good working relationship
                    with him during those years before he became so erratic, eccentric, and
                    dictatorial.</p>
                <p>Q: It sounds to me as though Karume, at least for a while, had the same sort of
                    balance among foreigners and foreign interests as Julius Nyerere had in Tanzania
                    with the Russians-</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: To a degree, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the Chinese that were in Tanzania, as well as
                        thScandinavians and the Germans and the Canadians.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, but the West didn't have as many countries represented in
                    Zanzibar, just the British, a one-man French consulate, and ourselves. So we
                    were really outnumbered by the communist countries, and more so by the number of
                    people they brought into Zanzibar. In the long run, it would not matter, as
                    Zanzibar's importance in the Cold War diminished and both East and West lost
                    interest in it. But that did not happen while I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. So now we're up to '65?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, let's put it at the very beginning of 1965. Frank was well in
                    stride running the embassy. All of us were pretty productive. U.S. relations
                    with Zanzibar had improved. So, things were definitely going well when,
                    suddenly, there was an unexpected reverse. On January 15, Frank went to Dar es
                    Salaam. While he was there, Bill Leonhart was summoned to Nyerere, who said that
                    Frank and Leonhart's deputy chief of mission, Bob Gordon, had been involved in a
                    plot to overthrow the government of Zanzibar.</p>
                <p>Now this was totally idiotic. It stemmed from a telephone conversation that Frank
                    and Bob had had earlier in the month, a telephone conversation in which they
                    were trying to work out a way to get a high-level American official to attend
                    the celebration of the first anniversary of the revolution. Ambassador Leonhart
                    was against the idea, and there was opposition to it in the State Department.
                    Frank and Bob were developing arguments in its favor. They were speaking
                    guardedly, using code words, because they figured the phones were tapped. Among
                    other things, one of them said something like, “This will give us ammunition to
                    get the big gun,” the big gun meaning [laughter] Assistant Secretary of State
                    Soapy Williams, G. Mennen Williams, who they hoped would come for the
                    celebration.</p>
                <p>Whether the tape was doctored or not, it and some spurious intelligence reports
                    that he had seen convinced Nyerere that Frank and Bob Gordon were concocting a
                    plan to bring down the Zanzibar government. Nyerere foolishly believed it. His
                    rush to judgement is all the more incredible considering that only two months
                    earlier he had been burned by an equally unlikely fabrication that the American
                    government, in league with Portugal, was plotting to overthrow the Tanzanian
                    government. The allegation was based on documents that had been sent to
                    Nyerere's foreign minister by the Tanzanian ambassador to the Congo Republic.
                    The foreign minister, Oscar Kambona, had made them public and denounced the
                    United States. This gave rise to a surge of anti-Americanism in the country.
                    Subsequently, a document-authentication expert proved to the Tanzanians that the
                    documents were crude forgeries. Kambona's and Nyerere's readiness to believe the
                    worst of the United States had made them look foolish and must have been
                    embarrassing to Nyerere. But here he was, once again acting precipitately.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Leonhart urged him to reconsider, but Nyerere was adamant. Frank and
                    Bob Gordon had to go. Frank was allowed to come back to Zanzibar to be able to
                    pack before leaving. He went to Karume and told him the whole story. Karume was
                    sympathetic, and said that he had no role in the affair. He and Frank parted on
                    cordial terms. The next day, we said goodbye, and off he went. His wife, Jean,
                    stayed on long enough to pack their household effects.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>Nyerere, incidentally, finally came to realize, after receiving messages from
                    President Johnson and from Secretary Rusk in which the entire story had been
                    laid out to him, that he had made a mistake. He was contrite, but nothing could
                    be done. In one talk he had with Leonhart, he got so emotional that he wept, and
                    he said, “This is one more damn period we've just got to get through.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But obviously it had no bad effect on Frank's career. So
                        theryou are in Zanzibar, again in charge?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. There I was, once again, in charge of the embassy. I was acting
                    consul. By the way, we were no longer an embassy because when Zanzibar and
                    Tanganyika joined to become Tanzania, Zanzibar no longer was the capital, so we
                    were reverted back to consular status. I was acting consul for a larger
                    establishment than when I was acting charg� d'affaires, when I was the only one
                    there. I now had, in some ways, a more challenging kind of a job, certainly from
                    a management point of view. Before long, Washington, perhaps figuring that if
                    once again they sent someone to be my boss again, he might get thrown out
                    [laughter], decided to let me be consul for the rest of my tour of duty. This
                    was done even though Frank's replacement would come out while I was still there
                    and would be an officer who outranked me. The officer was Tom Pickering, and we
                    worked together for the rest of my tour, which ended in November 1965.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tom Pickering, another one of the shining stars of the

                <p>PETTERSON: Absolutely.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: I wrote an efficiency report [laughter] on him. I hope it was a good
                    one! He was an extraordinary guy and a lot of fun to work with. He and Alice,
                    and Julie and I had good times in the months that we were together in Zanzibar
                    continuing to do the kind of work that Frank and I had done. We had some new
                    difficulties. For example, the Zanzibaris accused Harry Radday, who was the USIS
                    officer, of being up to no good. According to the charges against him, he was
                    seeing the wrong kind of people, plotting, doing this or that. It was total
                    nonsense. I went to Karume, and said, in effect, “This is not true; don't do
                    this! He is a good officer, who has done nothing wrong.”</p>
                <p>But Karume was inflexible. He said the decision had been made by the
                    Revolutionary Council and could not be changed. Harry, who was popular among the
                    Zanzibaris, and, because he was so talat least six foot fivwas called “Bwana
                    Twiga” (Mister Giraffe), had gotten around town a lot, meeting a wide range of
                    people in the course of doing his job as our cultural affairs and information
                    officer. I'm convinced that either a hostile intelligence service or extreme
                    radicals in the government, or the two working together, had fabricated the
                    reports about Harry. And they had chosen him because he was being effective in
                    countering the anti-American propaganda that was so prevalent and was providing
                    Zanzibaris with information about the United States and the outside world that
                    otherwise was not available to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So he was good at his job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: He was good at his job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And making friends for America?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. Harry was expelled quietly, which was how Karume had proposed to
                    handle the matter. Another USIS officer, a man named Barney Coleman, whose most
                    recent assignment had been in Nigeria, replaced Harry. Barney eventually ran
                    into the same problem. He was out seeing people and doing his job. Our enemies
                    didn't like it, stories were circulated about him, nasty stories, and Karume
                    said he had to go. Again, I remonstrated with him. Karume could be reasonable on
                    some things, but he dug his heels in, and Barney Coleman had to go. So we didn't
                    have complete easy sailing, to say the least. There was always some kind of
                    battle going on.</p>
                <p>Q: So what it sounds then, Don, a little bit sort of like Stalin, you know.
                    Karume is a man with great strengths, but also very deep suspicions, because
                    this makes, I think, three American diplomats who have been quietly or otherwise
                    pushed out of Zanzibar in a year!</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: That's right, and before that, of course, Fritz Picard. Karume did
                    have definite weaknesses. He was a very suspicious man, and with reason as time
                    went on because he had enemies within his own establishment. Some of those
                    people came to grief later on and were executed. Othman Sharif was. He was the
                    minister I mentioned when Fritz Picard got expelled, the one who had authorized
                    the release of the American reporters and before the revolution had been a
                    political enemy of Karume. After the union of Tanganyika and Zanzibar, he became
                    a minister in the Tanzanian government, serving in Dar es Salaam. Later, he went
                    to Washington as ambassador. On a return trip to Zanzibar, Karume imprisoned
                    him. Nyerere got him out, and he went back to the mainland. But later on, the
                    government of Zanzibar accused him treason. He was brought back to the island
                    and was executed. Abdul Kassim Hanga, the vice president of Zanzibar, was also
                    executed, along with some others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: More and more like Stalin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, he became, unfortunately, more and more-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Paranoid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Paranoid, erratic and dictatorial as time went on. My own relationship
                    with him, and again, this was before he really got bad, was quite good because
                    of the friendship we had established when I was a vice consul, and because I
                    continued to deal with him in his own language, and, of course, treated him with
                    a proper measure of respect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, Don, in terms of the career Foreign Service, this is
                        anothereally good argument for language training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Oh, absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you say, in retrospect, that the Foreign Service
                        should bdoing more in terms of training officers in languages?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes! The Foreign Service at different times placed greater emphasis on
                    foreign language training, but in general the focus was on training as many
                    people as possible, but not training enough in depth. Many officers, as a
                    result, would gain a superficial working knowledge of a language, but far short
                    of excellence. The Service did not, and still does not, have enough officers
                    possessing a grasp of languages approaching bilinguality, especially in
                    difficult, important languages such as Arabic, Chinese, and Japanese. We have
                    some, but not nearly enough.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that sort of wraps up Zanzibar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Zanzibar, almost. Our second and third children, Julianne and John,
                    were born while we were in Zanzibar. Julianne was born on the island in 1963 and
                    John in Dar es Salaam in 1965. Julie had gone to the mainland to have John
                    because the hospital in Zanzibar had deteriorated so much by 1965. In September
                    we had our first and only vacation while we were in Zanzibar. We spent four days
                    in game parks at Ngorongoro Crater and Lake Manyara and had a wonderful time.
                    She and the children left Zanzibar near the end of September, and I followed in
                    November, ending my assignment in Zanzibar and turning the reins over to Tom
                    Pickering.Let me interject here, that if whoever reads this account would like
                    more details on what happened in Zanzibar, I have written a book entitled
                    Revolution in Zanzibar that will be published by Westview Press in April
                    2002.</p>

                    weeks with her parents and family in Mexico. After I rejoined her and the
                    children there, we went to California. I had a lot of home leave, and we spent

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sixty-five.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: After New Year's Day, we went to Washington before going off on our
                    next assignment. En route to Mexico from Zanzibar, I had stopped in Washington
                    for consultations and to see about an assignment. My personnel officer was
                    Charlie Whitehouse. He didn't think much of my request to go to the Congo or
                    Vietnam, or some such interesting place. He said, “You know, Frank's example
                    shows that if you stay with your neck out on the block long enough, it's going
                    to get chopped off.” He thought a less volatile country would be in order and
                    that I needed a political officer job in a large embassy, since I had had a
                    consular job in Mexico and had just come from a tiny post. He said, “Nigeria
                    would be a good assignment for you - Lagos, Nigeria.”</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>So I was assigned as the number two officer in a three-person political section
                    in Lagos. We left Washington in January 1966 and flew on a Pan Am flight to
                    Lagos. Pan Am then had a flight from the U.S. to Africa. As we approached the
                    airport in Lagos, announced, “Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry to tell you that
                    there's been some trouble. The airport has been seized by army troops. The
                    government has just been taken over by the military.”Let me give a little
                    background. Nigeria had been independent for a several years. Its coalition
                    government was led by Amadu Tafawa Balewa, a northerner and a very remarkable
                    man. There was political friction in Nigeria, especially between the larger
                    tribes, the Yoruba in the west, the Ibos in the south, and the Hausa-Fulani in
                    the north. The northerners, the more numerous people in the country, were
                    somewhat dominant. The frictions were causing unrest, and some violence had
                    broken out.</p>
                <p>Before I arrived in Nigeria, I knew there was some political turmoil, but I
                    didn't know how bad it was. The embassy was not sending political officers out
                    of town enough to comprehend the full scope of the violence that was taking
                    place not all that far from Lagos. They really did not have a handle on the full
                    extent of the dissension and violence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that? Why not send people out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I don't know; I wasn't there. I just know that the State Department
                    was annoyed by this failure of the embassy to really be on top of the situation.
                    I don't believe, however, that the embassy could have foreseen that the military
                    were suddenly going to take over.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Q: This is Nick Heyniger, Lambert Heyniger, and today is February 14, 2001. I am
                    again interviewing Ambassador Don Petterson about his experiences in Africa. We
                    are now starting Don's tour of duty in Lagos, Nigeria.</p>
                <p>So, Don, then, you told me that as you and Julie were just arriving in Lagos,
                    they had told the pilot of the plane that there had been some military activity.
                    What...can you pick it up there?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Sure, let me go back to that. The plane landed, and the military
                    attach�, or someone from his office, and an officer from the embassy's
                    administrative section were there to meet us. We drove through the cordon of
                    troops around the airport into Lagos, and I went to the embassy. The ambassador
                    greeted me and joked that maybe I had brought the trouble with me. Somehow my
                    Zanzibar reputation had preceded me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: Burt Matthews, a very distinguished, gentlemanly man othe old school
                    and a veteran Foreign Service officer.</p>
                <p>The root cause of Nigeria's political instability and the military coup was the
                    intense tribal feelings that had arisen from, or at the very least had been
                    exacerbated by, the regional framework of government that the British had
                    fashioned. It reflected their colonial policy of indirect rule through the
                    strongest groups in the country, the Hausa-Fulani in the north, the Ibo in the
                    east, the Yoruba in the west. The country was divided into regions - those three
                    regions and the mid-west, which was sort of a mixture of the east and the
                    west.</p>
                <p>The post-independence government was a coalition headed by Tafawa Balewa. He was
                    honest, highly intelligent, and a moderate, unlike some of the other leaders of
                    the country, especially the regional governor of the North, Ahmadou Bello, the
                    Sardana of Sokoto, and the governor of the West, Samuel Akintole. There was
                    widespread corruption, particularly in the Western Region. The corruption and
                    Nigeria's serious economic problems gave rise to political unrest. Underlying
                    all this were tribal tensions. The unrest and dissatisfaction infected the
                    army.</p>
                <p>In late 1965, with northern political backing, Akintole was victorious in a
                    blatantly rigged election. This sparked a political explosion that resulted in
                    extreme violence especially in the area between the capital, Lagos, and the
                    capital of the western region, Ibadan. Law and order began to break down.
                    Virtual anarchy reigned for a while.</p>
                <p>The embassy tended to downplay the seriousness of the violence, in part because
                    they really didn't know, at first hand, what it was like. In contrast, the New
                    York Times and the Washington Post correspondents, respectively Lloyd Garrison
                    and Donald Loucheim, were filing stories that painted an alarming picture.
                    Washington was concerned, and the State Department began to have doubts about
                    the acuity of embassy reporting and analysis. I was unaware of all this.</p>
                <p>The rigged election, ensuing violence, and continued corruption finally pushed
                    southern mid-grade army officers, most of them Ibos, to mount a coup attempt,
                    which took place early in the morning of January 15, 1966, the day that we
                    arrived.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>In Lagos, the dissident officers killed Balewa and senior military officers,
                    almost all of them northerners. In Ibadan, they killed Akintole and senior
                    military officers. The same occurred in Kaduna, the capital of the Northern
                    Region. The army commander himself, General Aguiyi Ironsi, escaped death,
                    although he had been marked for death. He managed in the course of the morning
                    hours to rally loyal troops and put down the rebellion in time. He then formed a
                    military government. The surviving civilian leaders responded to the unsettling
                    events by readily agreeing to the army takeover. The overthrow of the government
                    was met with great joy on the part of southerners. In the north, there was some
                    approval, but a subdued reaction and only lukewarm support. Within a few months,
                    support throughout the country for the military government waned.</p>
                <p>Julie and I and our children got settled into our house. I begapulling my weight
                    in the political section.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, let me interrupt you here, Don, just to ask you how many officers in the
                    political section? What were your duties? What were you supposed to be working
                    on?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: It was a three- person political section. I was the second officer. My
                    duties were to report on Nigeria's foreign relations and to assist the political
                    counselor in following internal affairs in the Lagos area. Later I was given the
                    responsibility to travel to the North to work with the consulate there during my
                    stay and to report on what I had observed. In addition, I traveled to the East
                    and did the same thing there. So I had a variety of reporting
                    responsibilities.</p>
                <p>For me it was an adjustment after having been in charge of the consulate in
                    Zanzibar and not having to have my messages cleared, now, in Lagos, to have to
                    submit everything I wrote through the political counselor. He was a man who,
                    whenever I handed him a report, would pick up his blue pencil even before
                    starting to read the report. He was an inveterate nit picker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like many Foreign Service officers that we both
                        know!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: [Laughter] Well, I got used to it. I began reporting. I recall an
                    airgram I wrote in April noting that the federal military government, as it was
                    called, had failed to curb urban unrest, that corruption had resumed within the
                    government, and that public support for the government was decreasing. More
                    important, I noted, were indications of unrest or instability in the army. Later
                    that month I made a driving trip with Julie and our youngest child, John, to the
                    north, along with economic officer Bob Rackmales and his wife Mary. We drove to
                    several northern towns and saw many examples of the great diversity of the
                    northern people. An army officer in Kaduna told me about the serious split that
                    now existed in the army.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>In late May, General Ironsi, the supreme military commander, the head of
                    government, decreed that henceforth Nigeria would have a centralized form of
                    government rather than a federation. This act contributed to the belief of many
                    northerners that the Ibos were bent on dominating the whole country.</p>
                <p>Many Ibos lived and worked in the north, where they had skills and the education
                    that the poorly educated northerners did not have. The Ibos tended to be very
                    aggressive, sometimes arrogant, as well as extremely able. Northerners, by and
                    large, hated them. Thousands of Ibos lived in sections of northern cities called
                    Sabon Garis. Following Ironsi's announcement, riots broke out in the north.
                    Several hundred Ibos were killed, and thousands fled back to their homeland in
                    the East. Based on talks I had with Consul Bernie Stokes and his staff and
                    others in Kaduna, I wrote a cable highlighting that northern traditional leaders
                    in civil service had actually organized these riots. I reported that hatred of
                    the Ibos and fears of Ibo domination were intense. Ironsi tried to cool down the
                    situation and backed away from his centralization decree, saying that he meant
                    only to provide for a unified command within the army. This did not wash with
                    northern military officers and military personnel in general. In July, young
                    officers rose up, killed Ibo officers, and seized the government. Ironsi was
                    assassinated.</p>
                <p>The northern officers took over the government and chose a young 32-year-old
                    officer, a well-liked moderate named Yakubu Gowon, who was called Jack Gowon, to
                    head the government. For a time, the northern military were inclined to pull out
                    of the southern area, return to the north, and establish a separate country. But
                    Gowon resisted this successfully, and the new military government was in
                    business. He convened a constitutional conference in September that tried to
                    work out a new acceptable framework for governing Nigeria, but its deliberations
                    were cut short when northerners started killing Ibos in northern towns. At first
                    the violence was limited to two cities, but it spread, and several thousand
                    peoples were killed. The survivors left for the East. All told, about a million
                    Ibos from outside their homeland came back to the east.</p>
                <p>The military governor of the East, Lieutenant Colonel Emeka Odumegwu Ojukwu,
                    refused to recognize Gowon as supreme military commander. The embassy had
                    foreseen the possibility of the northern coup but mistakenly did not believe
                    secession was likely in the foreseeable future. This was communicated to
                    Washington. The estrangement of the East from the rest of the country
                    intensified. Young eastern intellectuals, in particular, were agitating for
                    separation. In October the State Department and Ambassador Matthews had come to
                    disagree on the prospects for a breakup of Nigeria and on possible danger to
                    foreigners in the country. The ambassador did not believe that Nigeria was
                    heading for a breakup. In stating, as he did, that war between regions in the
                    near future was only a remote possibility, the ambassador was wrong. He was
                    right, though, in telling Washington that foreigners would not be the targets of
                    violence. Soon, however, the ambassador and the embassy realized that Eastern
                    secession was close to taking place. The reporting from our consul in Enugu, Bob
                    Barnard, was excellent and painted a picture of a breakup coming soon.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>The ambassador and Washington also differed on Nigerian unity. He, reflecting
                    American policy as it had been previously stated, thought that the maintenance
                    of Nigerian unity was of utmost importance and recommended that to help keep the
                    country together, the United States government should apply threats or sanctions
                    against the East. He ran into disagreement from Secretary of State Dean Rusk.
                    Rusk said that the United States should, and I quote, “be very careful about
                    nominating ourselves as a supervisor of Nigerian unity.” Rusk felt it should be
                    up to the British and fellow Commonwealth countries to take the lead in applying
                    any measures to keep the East from seceding.</p>
                <p>In late October of that year, 1966, Tom Smith and I drove to the North. Tom was
                    about my age. He was my counterpart in the economic section. The number two
                    officer in the four- or five-person economic section, Tom was a very able
                    officer who one day would be ambassador to Nigeria. We took a 17-day trip by
                    car, a Chevy van, throughout the northern region. It was a great adventure. We
                    found that life for the vast majority of northerners seemed to be largely
                    unaffected by the crisis in the country. But what we saw in the Sabon Garis were
                    stark reminders of what had happened and how serious it had been, and how this
                    must have deeply affected the Ibos who survived. The Sabon Garis were ghost
                    towns, deserted, with the detritus of people who had fled rapidly left behind.
                    Most northerners we talked to had no apologies for what had happened to the
                    Ibos, for the pogrom that had killed so many. There were exceptions, but in
                    general there was no remorse, and the feeling was one of good riddance.</p>
                <p>Tom and I drove as far east as Lake Chad. Because of the gas shortage in the
                    country that existed as a result of all the turmoil, we carried big jerry cans
                    of gasoline with us. Every night we would take the cans out of the vehicle and
                    carry them inside our sleeping quarters. We generally stayed in government
                    guesthouses. Sometimes the accommodations were pretty Spartan. Other times, they
                    weren't bad at all. We did a long report on our trip when we got back, and it
                    was well received in the embassy and in Washington.</p>
                <p>In Lagos our Ibo friends were departing, fearing for their lives. I had met some
                    in my work. One was a close friend in the ministry of foreign affairs. Julie and
                    I got to know him and his family, but they were among those who left. One day,
                    our Hausa gardener attacked and tried to beat up our Ibo cook. We fired the
                    gardener, but not long afterwards the cook left for the east.</p>
                <p>From April 1967 onward, Ibo secession was expected at any time. Some time before
                    that, air travel between Lagos and the East had suspended. Embassy officers
                    periodically would travel by car to the East carrying the diplomatic pouch. It
                    was, I think, in mid- April that my turn came. I was driven in a van through the
                    Mid-West Region to the Niger River. There I got into a canoe, carried the pouch
                    across, was met on the other side by a consulate employee in a van, and drove to
                    Enugu.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes.</p>

                <p>PETTERSON: There was a bridge across the Niger at Onitsha, but the Eastern Region
                    military government had blocked it to all traffic. Later, during the Biafran
                    war, it was partially destroyed by retreating Biafran soldiers but was repaired
                    and reopened in 1970.</p>
                <p>Q: But was this not evidence that the Ibos in the east were cutting themselves
                    off from the rest of the country, the fact that you had to take a canoe?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. By this time, Easterners wanted nothing more to do with the rest
                    of the country and were sliding toward secession. At any rate, a canoe I took.
                    [Laughter]</p>
                <p>In Enugu the sentiment for secession was very high. I reported that one night at
                    a popular, crowded bar (I recall the name was the Progress Bar), young men were
                    vocal in expressing their bitterness and their hatred of northerners. They said
                    they were ready to go to war, and I reported that sentiment back to Lagos. There
                    was a feeling in the embassy that Bob Barnard was showing too much sympathy for
                    the East, or was getting too far out in front in indicating that secession was
                    right around the corner. The embassy's leadership came to think that his
                    reporting was colored by his sympathy, and that was unfortunate for Bob.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this another instance, in your opinion, of officers who
                        reporthings that Washington doesn't want to hear sometimes have a hard
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, although in this case it was the embassy, not Washington. The
                    situation within the U.S. mission had become difficult for some officers. Let me
                    explain. The ambassador's emphasis on supporting Nigerian unity and, by that,
                    supporting the federal military government, and his view that Washington should
                    try to deter the East from seceding caused some in the embassy, led by the DCM,
                    the military attach�, and my boss (the political counselor), to view Bob
                    Barnard, as I said, as being sympathetic to the Eastern cause. This, in my view,
                    unfair criticism severely damaged Bob Barnard's career later on.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>Ray Wach was the most junior officer in our political section. He and I fell
                    under some suspicion of being less than foursquare supporters of Nigerian unity.
                    At least one report I had made from the East had caused some annoyance in the
                    embassy because it didn't square with the embassy hierarchy's judgment of what
                    was really happening. This, even though I was just reporting what I was seeing
                    and hearing and not venturing opinions. In addition to the annoyance with my
                    reporting from the East, I was criticized for continuing to see New York Times
                    correspondent Lloyd Garrison and Washington Post correspondent Don Loucheim, who
                    were in disfavor with the embassy brass. They didn't like their reporting, and
                    embassy reporting officers were advised to steer clear of them. However, I liked
                    them, and I found it useful to trade information with them. We had a symbiotic
                    relationship. They had sources of useful information that the embassy didn't
                    have, and I saw no reason not to tell them things that were not sensitive, that
                    belonged in the public domain. Nevertheless my association with them didn't do
                    my reputation any good, I suppose, with certain of the embassy officers. I don't
                    want to say that the DCM and political counselor were angry with me. We had a
                    good relationship, despite the fact that from time to time something I did
                    annoyed them. When word got around that I had been awarded a fellowship at
                    Stanford and would be transferred in July of '67, Garrison and Loucheim thought
                    my bosses had engineered my transfer. [Laughter] This of course, was not true,
                    and I told them so.</p>
                <p>As I said, I was not really in deep hot water at all and had good relations with
                    the DCM and certainly with the ambassador, who was a wonderful man. I would
                    fault him only for not having taken firmer control of the DCM, the military
                    attach�, and the political counselor and thereby avoided the antagonisms that
                    became a serious problem within the embassy.</p>
                <p>Not long after I left Nigeria, Ray Wach, who wore his sentiments on his sleeve,
                    so to speak, in that he didn't hide his sympathy for the plight of southerners,
                    was castigated for his views, and his efficiency report was so bad that his
                    career was fatally damaged. This was in a way similar to what was taking place
                    in Vietnam, where Foreign Service officers (many of them junior officers) were
                    reporting truthfully on the situation they were covering. When their reports
                    were inconsistent with the embassy's party line, they got into trouble. There
                    was really a kind of censorship. It wasn't that bad in Nigeria, but it was bad
                    enough, and I was lucky to leave when I did.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>On one of my last trips to the East, I was in Enugu. I borrowed a USAID (United
                    States Agency for International Development) van and drove north across the
                    border between the Eastern and Northern regions. The war between the East, which
                    soon would be called Biafra, and the North had not yet started, and I was able
                    to get across the border. However, further up the road, not far from Makurdi,
                    soldiers examined my passport, didn't know what to make of it, took me into
                    custody, and drove me to the chief of police of Makurdi, who was a British civil
                    servant. He laughed at the incident and let me go about my business. Well, one
                    of my objectives there was to see what military dispositions might be, see
                    whether troops had moved down from the north into Makurdi. I nosed around a
                    little bit and made the mistake of talking to a couple of British civil servants
                    (including the police chief), who I assumed would be forthright with me. Well,
                    they weren't, and they reported what I was doing. The federal authorities in
                    Makurdi in turn sent a report to Lagos, and a complaint about me was conveyed to
                    the embassy. The DCM, who handled the case, told me when I returned to Lagos
                    that he had resisted the call for my expulsion from Nigeria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not quite clear. I mean you were a political officer
                        in thembassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Right.</p>
                <p>Q: Political officers are supposed to go out and talk to lots of people, ask
                    questions, and try to find out not only what's going on, but also the attitudes
                    of various people towards that! This is exactly what you were doing. Who was
                    concerned? I mean, did the people think that you were spying?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, the Nigerian federal government authorities, whoever they were in
                    Makurdi, didn't like what I was doing. Their state of mind was an indication of
                    the tension within the country, of the great suspicion about spies, subversion,
                    saboteurs, you name it. So with that kind of atmosphere, the Federal government
                    authorities in Makurdi did not react rationally to what I was doing and they
                    blew the whistle back to Lagos. Someone in the Federal Military Government had
                    the same kind of attitude and sought my expulsion. But Clint Olson, the DCM,
                    talked them out of it.</p>
                <p>On another trip, my last trip to the East, I participated with consulate officers
                    and a couple of other people from our embassy in helping with the evacuation of
                    American citizens from the region. A chartered DC-8 aircraft made shuttle
                    flights to Lagos to take all of the American civilians out who wanted to go, and
                    most did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of Enugu?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: The entire Eastern Region. On May 30, Ojukwu, the military governor of
                    the East, announced the East's independence and the formation of the Republic of
                    Biafra. In July the civil war began. There were signs around town warning of
                    possible air raids. I remember walking in town one day with Barry Watchorn, an
                    officer of the Australian embassy and a close friend. We were reading a sign
                    that said, “In case of an air raid, jump into the nearest ditch.” Well, the
                    ditches in town were open sewers. [Laughter] We resolved that if an air raid
                    came, we would stand [laughter] and watch instead of jumping into the ditch.</p>
                <p>Near the end of July, Julie, our children, and I left Nigeria. Incidentally, it
                    was ironic that the officer who replaced me in Lagos as the second man in the
                    political section was Fritz Picard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who had been your boss in Zanzibar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: He'd been my boss in Zanzibar.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: January 15, 1966, the day of the coup.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you did about a year and a half?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is a rather abbreviated tour.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, a normal tour of duty for most officers was two years. But I had
                    applied for and received a fellowship and was transferred after only a year and
                    a half so that I could enroll at Stanford at the beginning of September.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As far as you know, that was just happenstance?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: Oh, yes, sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There wasn't any effort on the part of either the
                        Department othe embassy to shorten your tour?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Oh, no. I know that I was well regarded in the Department. Certainly
                    the officers in charge of Nigerian affairs had conveyed that to me on a trip
                    they'd made to Lagos and later when I went back to Washington on my way to
                    Stanford. And, as I have said, I wasn't in such bad order with the embassy brass
                    that they would have tried to get me out. No, I was very fortunate to get the
                    fellowship!</p>
                <p>Let me explain. This was a National Institute of Public Affairs Fellowship that I
                    had been awarded. NIPA awarded fellowships to middle-grade civil servants to go
                    to various universities that participated in the program - Princeton, Harvard,
                    USC, University of Indiana, several others, including Stanford. I was given a
                    choice, and I chose Stanford, and got it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Don, you have now left Nigeria and started your
                        fellowship aStanford.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: We flew from Lagos to Switzerland, where we picked the Mercedes 230
                    that I'd ordered. With the diplomatic discount, the car cost just under $3,000.
                    It was really a bargain!</p>

                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: We drove across France and took a ferry across the channel to London,
                    where I shipped the car to San Francisco. Before going to Stanford, we went to
                    Mexico-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To see Julie's parents?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: To see her family, and then to California, where we visited my
                    parents, relatives, and some friends of ours, and drove up the coast to
                    Stanford. We lived in Escondido Village (which was married-students' housing)
                    and had a great year. The NIPA Fellowship did not require any particular course
                    for its recipients, except a core seminar on issues and problems of the United
                    States. The ten or so other NIPA fellows at Stanford and I studied race
                    relations, poverty, Appalachia and so forth. It was an excellent course,
                    especially for a Foreign Service officer who'd been living overseas. I took
                    courses for credit (which I didn't have to do) and audited others. I took
                    Russian history, American diplomatic history, Southeast Asian history, a seminar
                    on administrative decision-making in government, and French, as I recall. I
                    learned, and this was probably one of the most important things that happened to
                    me in that academic year, I learned what Vietnam was all about. When I was in
                    Nigeria, I was among the embassy officers who agreed to go secondary schools and
                    gave a canned presentation prepared by the U.S. Information Service on Vietnam,
                    on the rightness of the American cause, on the evils of the Communist warfare
                    there. I didn't know the true, complex nature of the issue or have much of an
                    understanding about the opposition in America to the war. At Stanford, as at
                    other campuses throughout the country, there was a lot of ferment about the
                    Vietnam War. I got a good taste of this ferment from students, from
                    demonstrations, and from classroom discussions about Vietnam. The course I took
                    on Southeast Asian history was also useful. When I left Stanford, I had a much
                    better understanding of Vietnam and why our course of action there, our policy,
                    was mistaken.</p>
                <p>In the summer of '67, we drove across the United States to Washington.</p>

                <p>PETTERSON: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or mid-career training or something like this is a good

                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: Oh, absolutely! To the Department's great credit, it provides some
                    kind training break for many officers. Some take specialized courses, in
                    economics, for example. Several friends of mine got master's degrees in
                    economics. The NIPA fellowship was one of various fellowships, including Woodrow
                    Wilson fellowships, that FSOs could compete for. Each year, only one Foreign
                    Service Officer got a NIPA fellowship. It was a wonderful experience and an
                    opportunity to get back in touch with what was happening not only in the
                    universities, but also in the United States outside the beltway, outside of
                    Washington, DC. You got an appreciation of what the American people were
                    interested in and thinking about.</p>

                    Stanford as a personnel officer in the State Department. I counseled political
                    officers and worked on their assignments. In those days, career development
                    personnel officers both counseled the officers who came under their jurisdiction
                    (in my case, O-4 and O-3 political officers) and worked with the regional
                    bureaus and functional bureaus to assign those officers. The real power for
                    assignments lay with the bureaus, but Personnel at least had some input in the
                    matter. Our concern was to try to find the best assignment for the career
                    development of the officer. But we often ran into the reality of the bureau
                    wanting somebody other than our suggested candidate. So there was a lot of
                    horse-trading that went on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say that those differences occurred frequently, and
                        I'm surthey did. How did those issues get resolved, and who did the
                        resolving?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Well, it was a matter of the skill of the career development and
                    counseling officer and maybe his or her boss, working with the geographic or
                    functional bureau personnel officers, who had a lot of authority on the
                    assignments. Again, the bureau had the last word. They could veto whatever
                    suggestions you made, so you had to use your diplomatic skills [laughter],
                    negotiating skills, if you had any, to try to get as good an assignment as
                    possible for your charges.</p>
                <p>Q: With a job like that, I'm sure that you met a large number of your colleagues,
                    got to know many of your, political officer colleagues during that two-year
                    period.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, I did. That was a good part of the job. I remember one day, a
                    young officer, he was younger than I, came in to see me. He was an O-4 and a
                    rising star in the Foreign Service. I was his personnel counselor. He told me he
                    was thinking of resigning. His name was Tony Lake, and he worked for Henry
                    Kissinger in the National Security Council. He, along with others, like Richard
                    Moose, broke with Kissinger over the Cambodian invasion. Tony simply couldn't
                    work any longer for Kissinger because of his, Tony's, opposition to the Nixon
                    administration's policies regarding Vietnam and Cambodia. I don't know what I
                    told him; but I think in essence I said, “Tony, this is your decision. It's a
                    tough one. You'll just have to be guided by your conscience.”</p>
                <p>And he left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He resigned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: He did resign, yes. This was in 1970. He came back into the State
                    Department in 1977 as a high ranking official, much higher that he had been
                    before. He was the head of the Policy Planning Staff. Of course, later on, in
                    the Clinton administration, he headed the National Security Council.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But this was the time during that period, during the
                        Vietnam Wawhen there was a great deal of stress in the Foreign Service as a
                        whole.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Sure. I saw young officers coming back from Vietnam. Occasionally,
                    when one of my colleagues went on leave, I would counsel his clients, FSO-5s,
                    relatively junior officers. I remember a couple of cases of young idealistic
                    officers. Their first tour of duty was with the program called CORDS (Civil
                    Operations and Rural Development Support) in Vietnam. This was part of the
                    pacification program. Right after they had come into the Service, taken the
                    Basic Officer's orientation course, and maybe had gotten some language training,
                    they were sent to Vietnam and went out into the provinces. Some of them ran into
                    the problem of reporting the truth and getting dinged for it. Some of them came
                    back bitter, some of them stayed in the Service, some of them didn't.</p>
                <p>It was a tough time. I was lucky; I don't know if I mentioned earlier that at one
                    point I had volunteered to go to Vietnam. I thought this would be an exciting
                    thing to do. I was talked out of it, and I'm very thankful [laughter] that I
                    was.</p>
                <p>Q: Just one last thing before we move on. This is oral history. Do you have any
                    suggestions as to how the personnel process in the State Department and the
                    Foreign Service could be improved?</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: Well, I've been away from the Service for the past two years, since I
                    left Liberia in 1999, and I'm not quite sure just how it works now. But what I
                    saw later in my career convinced me that the system they have now of people
                    bidding on assignments, of negotiating with Personnel, is very cumbersome, very
                    time-consuming. It is no more fair than the earlier system, in which assignments
                    which were made without a lot of input from the officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And even the officers aren't that much more
                        satisfied.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: They aren't, and a lot of negotiating outside the personnel system
                    goes on. An officer goes to somebody, a patron, or a matron, if you will, and
                    tries to get backing for a particular assignment. Another thing that I don't
                    like about today's Foreign Service is the lack of service discipline. No
                    assignment system will be free of flaws. But we should have one that, while
                    having safeguards for the individual officer's well being, has the authority to
                    make assignments stick. Once an assignment is made, the officer should have to
                    accept it unless there is a clear, reasonable, compelling reason against it. We
                    were quasi- military when you and I joined the Foreign Service. To me, that's
                    the way it should be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it is a career service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Exactly, and the needs of the service should predominate. As it is
                    now, the Department has a difficult time getting people to accept assignments to
                    hardship posts</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. So now it is 1970? PETTERSON: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had three years in State?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where are we going now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Near the end of my tour in Personnel, I chose an assignment to La Paz,
                    Bolivia. This is one of the perks of being in the personnel business. You had an
                    inside track for an assignment. I had hoped to get out of Africa and spend part
                    of my career in Latin America. I saw that a political officer slot at La Paz was
                    open, and the Bureau of Latin American Affairs had no problem with my candidacy.
                    However, the ambassador in La Paz wanted a friend, or somebody he knew, to take
                    that job.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure. Would you have been the chief of the political
                        section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I can't recall for sure, but I think so. It was not a big section. At
                    any rate, I didn't get the job. So I asked for and got an assignment to
                    Freetown, Sierra Leone, as the DCM. It turned out, I believe, to be a lot better
                    assignment for me, from a career standpoint.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Are you still a class four officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I was still a class four officer, so I was junior for that job, but
                    the ambassador had no problem with grade, even though the incumbent was an
                    O-2.</p>
                <p>Q: [Laughter] Well, I think you really got a plum because DCM jobs are very much
                    in demand all over the world. This would be an opportunity for you to acquire
                    some supervisory and management skills?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Sure. I didn't realize how important that was and how useful it could
                    be for a career. As it turned out, I got the job. We left Washington for
                    Freetown in July 1970. The two girls went to the International School, and John
                    attended the Cotton Tree pre-school, which was located in the embassy building.
                    Susan was eight, Julianne seven, and John five. We lived in a large apartment of
                    a four-story building which was perched on a rock cliff of a high ridge about
                    500 feet above the flatland down below on the edge of the sea. We had a great
                    view of the beaches and the ocean. It was a very, very nice place to live, but
                    Julie and I were in mortal fear every time the kids came out on the balcony, and
                    we never let them out there alone. One of the advantages of being in this place,
                    with its sheer fall down to rocks below, was that the famous “tiefmen” of Sierra
                    Leone wouldn't be able to get into our apartment. The “tiefmen” were thieves.
                    Sierra Leone, like Liberia, was noted for having very astute, very able thieves
                    who were called-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thiefmen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Tiefmen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: So we didn't have to worry about the tiefmen. We worrieabout our kids
                    occasionally, but not about the tiefmen.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>I replaced Bill De Pree, who was an O-2 and who later became a close friend. The
                    ambassador was Robert Miner. Bob Miner was an exceptionally able officer, an
                    expert in Greek and Turkish affairs, a man who should have been ambassador to
                    Greece or Turkey. But he tended to be outspoken. Because of that he didn't go as
                    high in the service as he should have. He got an ambassadorship-Q: Still, being
                    an ambassador is not bad!</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: That's right, but Sierra Leone was not Turkey. [Laughter] Actually, he
                    had been ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago before coming to Sierra Leone. He had
                    a very relaxed attitude about how the embassy should run and gave his DCM wide
                    authority. He didn't see that what was occurring in Sierra Leone was vital to
                    U.S. national interests, and this was reflected somewhat in the way he reported
                    on what was happening there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Incidentally, let me interrupt again here just to ask you,
                        believe there is a course, a short course for DCMs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: It did not exist then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. So you went out there without very much
                        briefinabout how to do your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: No. I briefed myself, of course, on important aspects of Sierra Leone.
                    I always did as much as I could to inform myself before I went to a post. I
                    steeped myself in whatever material I could get on the country, its politics,
                    economics, history, current events, everything. So I knew a lot about Sierra
                    Leone when I got there, but I didn't know beans about managing an embassy. I had
                    to learn on the job. That's the way the Service did it, and in some cases, it
                    turned out to be a disaster. I hope it didn't in my case. But you're right that
                    I had no training, as such, for being a DCM.</p>
                <p>So back we were in tropical Africa, in this little country, Sierra Leone, which
                    was bordered by Guinea and Liberia. Sierra Leone had considerable mineral
                    wealth. There were iron mines and a rutile mine. Diamond mining was the big
                    money maker, however. Sierra Leone was formerly a British colony. It had been
                    founded in 1787 with guidance from British anti-slavery elements, abolitionists.
                    Most of the settlers in Sierra Leone were captives who had been brought there
                    after being released from slave ships captured by the British navy. One group of
                    settlers were former slaves from America who had been living in Nova Scotia.
                    They had sided with the British during the American Revolution in exchange for
                    their freedom. After the American victory, they had ended up in Nova Scotia,
                    where they had a tough life. Freed slaves from West Indies, Jamaica, in
                    particular, were also part of the nucleus of the new colony.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>Sierra Leone became independent in 1961. In the 1967 national elections, the All
                    People's Congress, which was led by a labor leader named Siaka Stevens, gained a
                    parliamentary majority, but was prevented from taking power by a military coup.
                    I won't go into detail, but tribalism was involved, with Stevens and his party
                    being supported by the Temne tribe and the Limba tribe. The opposition, the
                    Sierra Leone People's Party, was supported mainly by the Mende, another large
                    tribe. The officers pulled off a coup, but enlisted men who favored Stevens and
                    who were disgruntled for other reasons overthrew the officers and turned the
                    government over to Stevens, who became the prime minister and who would be the
                    strong man of Sierra Leone for years afterward, for 18 years to be precise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is about the same time as Biafra, or maybe a year
                        later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, 1967, same time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that the events or people in Sierra Leone
                        werinfluenced by what was going on in Nigeria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Hard to say. Nothing has been written to that effect. I think that in
                    Sierra Leone it was mainly the local conditions, the political unrest, the
                    tribalism, and disgruntlement within the military that led to 1967 coup. At any
                    rate, Stevens's corrupt misrule of that country laid the foundation for the
                    political strife and violence that still exists in Sierra Leone, and which has
                    taken the country to the brink of total ruin.</p>
                <p>About two months after I started work, the ambassador and Mrs. Miner went on
                    leave. She was in poor health, and they stayed away longer than might otherwise
                    have been the case.</p>
                <p>Thus it was that I was in charge of the embassy when a political crisis occurred.
                    Some cabinet members who were fed up with Stevens's dictatorial ways and the
                    rampant corruption in the government, resigned and formed a new opposition
                    party. An internationally respected Sierra Leonean, a UN official named John
                    Karifa Smart, led it. Stevens, who was in London, hurried home and declared a
                    state of emergency. This was in September. In October he banned the new party
                    and put its leaders in prison. Pro- Stevens and anti-Stevens groups clashed in
                    outbreaks of violence at political rallies. Stevens got wind that some
                    dissatisfaction with him had surfaced in the army.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>On October 11 he summoned me to his residence. He told me that embassy officer
                    Mark Colby, who was our CIA station chief, had met the previous morning with a
                    dissident army officer. He asked me to have Colby leave the country. I
                    protested. I asked him, how Colby could have known that Stevens considered this
                    particular army officer disloyal. I told him that the liaison between Colby and
                    army officers and others was declared and that he and his government had
                    approved this. So there was no reason for Colby not to see an army officer. I
                    got Stevens to agree to meet with Colby and me. That evening we went to his
                    residence. Colby explained the situation, and noted that he really hadn't met
                    with the officer in question, a man named Sesay. That morning he had gone to the
                    barracks, but he didn't find him, and left. So there was no meeting. Stevens
                    listened, didn't declare himself, but said he would have to discuss it with his
                    cabinet. The next day he informed me that Colby had to go. He said it would be
                    done quietly, kept confidential, but the expulsion order was revealed in the
                    Freetown press. There was a spate of anti-American stories in the press and one
                    editorial declaring that I should be expelled too. I had a clipping of this. It
                    said: “There is another element in the United States Embassy who should be sent
                    off immediately. We have it as a matter of fact that there was revolution with
                    bloody effects in the last two countries he was assigned. A man of this type
                    must not spend a day longer in this country.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter] Zanzibar is coming back to haunt you
                        again.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, and Nigeria too. Julie and I wondered whether we should start
                    packing. The anti-American campaign, which was now in full swing, became
                    intense. The next day a mob of Steven's party faithful demonstrated in front of
                    the embassy. They pulled down the American flag from its flagpole and tore it
                    up. That same day, six soldiers were arrested and charged with involvement in an
                    alleged coup attempt. We received a threat by telephone that I was going to be
                    kidnaped. At noontime on my way home for lunch the next day, several men chased
                    my car and threw bottles at it. When I went to Stevens and told him about all
                    this, he expressed regret for the demonstration and other occurrences and gave
                    me assurances for the safety of Americans. He also told me that he'd put no
                    stock whatsoever in the editorial that had called for my expulsion. In time, the
                    press vilification came to a halt, and so too did the political crisis.</p>
                <p>But an undercurrent of political unrest and uneasiness in the army persisted.
                    Stevens distrusted the army commander, Brigadier General John Bangura. In late
                    November Ambassador Miner returned, and in January 1971 Stevens released most of
                    his political opponents from jail. But he was worried. In March he went to
                    Conakry, Guinea. There his friend, President S�kou Tour�, loaned him a
                    contingent of Guinean troops who accompanied him back to Freetown. This
                    infuriated most army officers and certainly Bangura.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>On March 23 Bangura launched what proved to be a very poorly conceived coup
                    attempt. An effort was made to kill Stevens at his residence, but it failed. The
                    coup attempt petered out when officers loyal to Stevens resisted and arrested
                    Bangura. In June, Bangura and two other army officers were executed. These were
                    the first executions out of all these political crises in Sierra Leone, and it
                    changed the whole tenor of subsequent political events. There had been a kind of
                    a comic opera quality to the 1967 coups, but now it was a very serious business
                    indeed, and later there were other executions. Stevens now had a clear road to
                    achieve his goal of making Sierra Leone into a republic and becoming its
                    executive president. This was done in April 1971.</p>
                <p>After the March coup attempt, the U.S. was once again accused of interference in
                    Sierra Leone's internal affairs. There was again a media campaign and a lot of
                    hostility. Some months later, however, the anti-American campaign abated.
                    Stevens himself, I believe, retained some suspicion that the U.S. government had
                    it in for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask, had Ambassador Miner come back by this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, I said earlier that he had returned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: This was in November.</p>
                <p>Q: Okay. Well, this took some of the pressure off of you. Do you think that
                    Ambassador Miner was successful in disabusing Stevens of his suspicions?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I would say not. Neither the ambassador nor I was able to erase some
                    residue, at least, of suspicion from Steven's mind. This suspicion was
                    occasionally manifested in sometimes-bizarre ways. Once, when I was charg�
                    d'affaires again, he told me that an American submarine had been sighted in
                    Freetown harbor and was obviously up to no good. He wanted Washington to explain
                    it. Well, the explanation was that there wasn't a submarine within thousands of
                    miles [laughter] of Sierra Leone. It was just an idiotic idea. This was
                    nonsense, and I told him so, diplomatically of course. Another time, he summoned
                    me to his office. I walked in, and he plunked down a .45 pistol (a U.S. Colt
                    .45) on his desk, and demanded to know why U.S. arms were coming into Sierra
                    Leone. I explained that American arms cold be found all over the world, and that
                    one .45 pistol was hardly something to get exercised about. At his request I
                    asked the State Department to obtain whatever information might be obtainable
                    from pistol's serial number. This was done, and that was the end of the
                    matter.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>In late 1971, Stevens called me in to complain that embassy general services
                    officer Bernie Nolan had taken his mid-assignment leave in Sierra Leone instead
                    of going to Europe or someplace, that he was staying home a lot, and that he was
                    seen changing the license plates on his car [laughter]. Stevens somehow thought
                    this meant that Nolan was up to no good.</p>
                <p>I told him that an American employee of the embassy could take leave in the local
                    country if he or she wanted to, and that Nolan had chosen to do that. As for
                    changing his license plates, the minister of foreign affairs had instructed all
                    embassies to change their vehicles' license plates to newly issued ones, and
                    that's why Nolan was doing that.</p>
                <p>Q: So what you're describing, as I hear it, is a really sort of hyper feeling on
                    the part of the host government about really relatively minor, unimportant
                    details of international light. General Service's officers are not usually the
                    subject of observation and supervision by host governments. The whole atmosphere
                    of Freetown sounds really sort of nervous and hypertense!</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Nervous, hypertense, and unsophisticated. Stevens was not a well-
                    educated man. There was a certain insularity about him and about his government,
                    and they tended to pick up these stories and believe them without really
                    thinking them through or considering that there could be a logical explanation.
                    Their nervousness also manifested their underlying suspicion that the United
                    States was so interested in Sierra Leone that it would do just about anything to
                    skew events there in its favor. Ambassador Miner tried to make it clear to
                    Stevens and others that the United States simply did not care much at all about
                    what was going on in Sierra Leone's internal affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter] That must have been rather awkward!
                        [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Well, it had to be done. Stevens was considered to be left wing. He
                    assumed that this didn't sit well with the United States government.</p>
                <p>Q: You would presume though, that the leader of a former British colony would be
                    much more interested in and much more concerned about what was going on with the
                    British High Commission. Did you have a chance to talk with your British
                    counterpart or your French counterpart?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Oh, sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And see if they were also subject to this attention?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: No, it was focused on us. The British didn't have the problem that we
                    did. There was some antagonism towards the British, but it didn't amount to
                    much. The animosity wasn't directed against the British government, but instead
                    against British-based commercial firm: DIMINCO, a diamond mining company, and
                    the Sierra Leone's Selection trust, which was also involved in the diamond
                    business. Despite commercial agreements with those companies that had been
                    favorable to Sierra Leone, Stevens and his cronies suspected that they were
                    ripping off Sierra Leone. This was ironic because Stevens and others were
                    enriching themselves in illegal deals involving diamonds.Another example of
                    Stevens' frame of mind occurred in January 1972. I was charg� d'affaires again
                    at the time. Stevens called me in, this time to complain that Bob Luneburg, the
                    deputy director of CARE - (Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere,
                    Inc.), which was helping provide assistance to Sierra Leone - had been seen
                    outside the army barracks examining weapons and taking notes. Soldiers detained
                    him briefly. Stevens said that this behavior could not be countenanced, and he
                    was inclined to deport Luneburg.</p>
                <p>I asked him to hold off and let me talk to Luneburg, which I did. Bob told me
                    that, after a party at one of their houses, he and a group of friends went on a
                    treasure hunt. One of the requirements was to estimate the weight of the brass
                    machine gun in front of the gate at Wilberforce barracks. So Luneburg went
                    there, looked at this thing, and while he was writing down what he thought it
                    might weigh, was detained. Phil Johnston, the director of the CARE operation in
                    Sierra Leone, and I wrote a report on what had happened and delivered it to
                    Stevens. We then met with Steven's press officer, and got him to agree not to
                    publish an account that was about to be released to the media, which would have
                    made the government of Sierra Leone look silly. He (the press officer) saw this
                    and pulled back the story. Luneburg was not thrown out. Phil Johnston,
                    incidentally, become executive director of CARE USA in 1980 and its president in
                    1989, and I would see him later on in my career</p>
                <p>Despite this kind nonsense, relations between the U.S. and Sierra Leone were
                    generally improving. We gained a lot of credit and good will from our self-help
                    program. We didn't have a formal USAID program for Sierra Leone, but we had a
                    well-funded self-help program. The embassy would evaluate proposed self-help
                    projects and provide funds for those we approved. Some proposals came from Peace
                    Corps volunteers who, working with villagers, devised projects.</p>
                <p>Q: How come no AID program?</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: In those days, USAID was phasing out its operations in a number of
                    African countries in conformance with congressional legislation that limited the
                    number of countries receiving U.S. economic aid to forty worldwide. Only ten of
                    these were in Africa. Sierra Leone was one of those countries that lost out.
                    There was a residual USAID program, projects which had been started and whose
                    funding was not exhausted. The U.S. was, for example, helping the WHO (World
                    Health Organization) eradicate smallpox. A Center for Disease Control doctor was
                    attached to the embassy for this program. The last known case of smallpox in the
                    world was in Sierra Leone.</p>
                <p>One of our most successful self-help projects involved providing piped water to
                    villages. CARE had the plastic water pipes, Peace Corps volunteers in the
                    villages designed the projects, village leaders approved the design, and the
                    embassy provided money for transporting the pipes and for necessary supplies and
                    equipment. We helped villages get, for the first time, piped water. This meant
                    that the women would not have to walk, sometimes for miles, to get water from a
                    stream and carry it back to the village. Piped water revolutionized their lives,
                    and our program was immensely popular. Through the self-help program, we also
                    helped build schools and feeder roads linking a village to a main road. These
                    kinds of projects were also very popular.</p>
                <p>I enjoyed working with CARE and certainly with Peace Corps staff and volunteers.
                    Julie and I traveled a lot in Sierra Leone, often with the children. We met and
                    stayed with volunteers when we went up-country. The villages we visited in
                    connection with self-help projects received us like royalty. Often native dances
                    would be organized. Sierra Leone had some of the most exciting, vibrant dancers
                    in all of Africa. In this and in other ways, we had a very good life in Sierra
                    Leone. Freetown was on a peninsula, and on that peninsula were some of the
                    nicest beaches I've ever seen. Along the west coast of Africa, the surf
                    generally comes pounding in, making it unsafe for swimming. But because of the
                    way the peninsula was situated, there was no heavy surf along its beaches. So
                    just about every Sunday, we and friends and our respective children would go to
                    one of several different beaches and have a great day.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Miner turned 60 in the summer of 1971. That was mandatory retirement
                    age in those days, and he left Sierra Leone. It would turn out that I would be
                    in charge of the embassy for almost a year thereafter.</p>
                <p>We expected the arrival of a new ambassador, Howard Mace, the director of
                    Personnel, who had been nominated to replace Ambassador Miner. The Senate,
                    however, did not confirm Mr. Mace. At his hearing he was opposed by the widow of
                    a Foreign Service officer who had committed suicide. Charles Thomas had been
                    selected out. He was a class four officer and under 50 years of age. Because of
                    the existing policy, he did not get a pension. That is, if you were not an O-3
                    or you were not 50 years of age, if you were...</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Neither of those...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, right. Then you didn't get a pension.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you got nothing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Not until you turned 60. Thomas was despondent and committed suicide.
                    His wife, at the hearing, testified against Mace, blaming him as a head of
                    Personnel for a policy that led to the death of her husband. The Senate did not
                    reject Mace, but they never him voted him out of committee. After six months the
                    administration pulled his name back.</p>
                <p>The next nominee was Clint Olson, who'd been DCM in Nigeria when I was there. He
                    too ran into flack. At Olson's hearing, Ray Wach, who had been selected out of
                    the Foreign Service because of the very negative report he had received on his
                    performance in his last year at Lagos, testified against Olson. Roger Morris, a
                    former FSO and a writer who had been strongly critical of the embassy's actions
                    during the crisis leading up to Biafra and during the war, also testified
                    against Olson. Despite the negative testimony, the Senate, after a few months,
                    confirmed him.</p>
                <p>All this time I had to explain to Stevens why the new American ambassador didn't
                    show up. He simply could not believe that somehow it wasn't a manifestation of
                    U.S. hostility toward him. The rest of the time I was in Sierra Leone (that last
                    year), I saw Stevens grow increasingly autocratic and repressive. For example,
                    another execution took place, this one of a political opponent. It was sad to
                    see a country of promise, like Sierra Leone, be slowly but surely robbed of its
                    diamond riches by Stevens and his cronies. When I was in Sierra Leone, one of
                    the residual AID programs was aimed at improving agricultural production. The
                    university experts there from Michigan State believed that Sierra Leone had the
                    potential to become self-sufficient in rice production and, as well, an exporter
                    of rice. But this never happened because of the corruption and mismanagement
                    that just pervaded the whole government, thanks to the corruption and misrule of
                    Stevens. Under Stevens, Sierra Leone began a downward spiral that has yet to
                    end.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're what, 20, 25 years later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: It's close to 30 years now. We left in '72, twenty-ninyears ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How tragic!</hi>

                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: Let me parenthetically ask, “Why do we have an embassy in this place,
                    all this bizarre stuff going on and the country of little interest to the United
                    States?”</p>
                <p>Well, the U.S. government had adopted the policy of universality. We would be
                    represented in every country in the world. There was some American economic
                    interest. In Sierra Leone, inasmuch as a U.S. company owned the rutile mine. But
                    Sierra Leone was really not of major importance to the United States, obviously.
                    It wouldn't have made a lot of difference if we didn't have an embassy there,
                    but universality was the name of the game.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I believe this was under President John F. Kennedy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: That we started the universality?</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, I think that that was part of the Kennedy approach to foreign policy -
                    that we would go anywhere, do anything, so we should have an embassy
                    everywhere.</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: We certainly didn't have universality in the prewar years. But in the
                    post- war world, in the Cold War, it was seen as important that we be
                    represented everywhere, and we were and still are.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Except for the Comoros. We finally closed our embassy iComoros.

                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: In the spring of 1972 I got a cable from African Bureau Assistant
                    Secretary of State David Newsom asking me to accept an assignment as political
                    counselor in Pretoria. I was unsure what to do.</p>
                <p>John Hurd was the ambassador. He was a political appointee who was said to be
                    close the government of South Africa, whose apartheid policies, were, of course,
                    despised throughout the world. Hurd had gone hunting with a minister of the
                    white government on Robin Island where Nelson Mandela was among the political
                    prisoners. I was unsure how it would be to work for this ambassador. Moreover, I
                    detested apartheid and preferred not to see it at first hand. So I called or
                    cabled some friends, seeking advice. They told me to take the job. I remember
                    that Beverly Carter, an African-American USIS (United States Information Agency)
                    officer who had been a friend of mine in Nigeria and was now one of Newsome's
                    deputies in AF, a very capable guy whom I liked and admired, told me that I
                    really needed to see apartheid to understand it.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>Q: Don, had you by this time, sort of, [laughter] more or less resigned yourself
                    to being a permanent African specialist? I mean, you weren't interested in
                    broadening yourself through service in another geographic area?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: No, no. I wanted to go to Latin America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, still?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: In fact in '72, before I had gotten the call from Dave Newsom, I had
                    put in for an assignment as Peace Corps Director in Chile. Some Foreign Service
                    officers had been Peace Corps directors. What I didn't know, however, was that
                    by 1972 the Nixon administration was not going to give any of those
                    directorships to an undeserving Foreign Service officer. They were political
                    plums. I was not really in the running. I thought I was, so did Personnel, but
                    the assignment never came about. Nat Davis, the director general of the Foreign
                    Service, discovered why and let me know.</p>
                <p>Then the Newsom offer came. I really wasn't in a position to say no,even though I
                    wasn't keen on the idea.</p>
                <p>Q: You were of two minds about it?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Right, and sought advice. I think I was just looking for reassurance.
                    Once I had heard from my friends, of course I accepted the assignment.</p>
                <p>Q: South Africa is an entirely different situation than Sierra Leone. You're
                    moving from a sort of small and rather back-watered, African-ruled country into
                    a large, relatively sophisticated, white-run country. Tell us about that
                    transition.</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: You're quite right. It was an entirely different situation. It was a
                    contrast also from working in a small embassy to a relatively large one. And
                    instead of running the embassy, I would be political counselor, which meant
                    supervising the reporting coming from the embassy and coordinating the reporting
                    from the consulates in Johannesburg, Durban, and Cape Town.</p>
                <p>The assignment gave me a fine opportunity for political reporting. There was a
                    lot of interest in what was happening in South Africa. It was a very complex,
                    challenging kind of an environment. People would be paying attention to what was
                    reported. I was also told, by the way, that Ambassador Hurd did not interfere in
                    the political reporting, whatever his views might have been. I would find when I
                    got there that John Hurd was a very nice man. He might have sympathized to a
                    certain extent with the white government, but he let the professionals do their
                    job.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that he was not a career officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: No-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a political appointee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, a political appointee. He was a Californian who'd made his money
                    in Texas in oil and ranching.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, he might have believed that his job as ambassador was
                        to have cordial relations with the government in power, whatever government
                        that might be.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Well, sure. No matter who was ambassador, that would be part of his or
                    her job. But Ambassador Hurd did not exercise the best of judgment in some of
                    the things he did, such as going to Robin Island, the story of which ended up in
                    Time magazine and other publications. Still, he was a very decent guy in many
                    ways, and he was certainly easy to work for. The job of a DCM in Pretoria was
                    extremely important because the DCM had to guide the ambassador, keep him out of
                    trouble, as well as oversee the running of an embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: When I arrived, it was Robert P. Smith, Bob Smith. The ambassador, as
                    political appointee, didn't know the Foreign Service, didn't know how to run an
                    embassy necessarily. He had some skills, but he depended on his DCM to run the
                    embassy, and also, in this case, to give him guidance on the political situation
                    and oversee to it the reporting and analyses.</p>
                <p>We left Freetown in July of '72 for home leave. Once again, our children and we
                    said goodbye to our friends. It seemed to us that the kids took these moves in
                    stride. They didn't complain, they didn't weep, but years later they told us
                    that it was, in reality, far from easy for them to leave friends behind, go to a
                    new place, fit into the new culture, the new school, the new environment, and
                    then after a time, go somewhere else. They really didn't like it. When they were
                    grown up, they looked back upon it in a different light. They saw that they had
                    had a very rich experience that kids who grew up in the same town in the United
                    States would never have. So they looked back with some nostalgia, but it wasn't
                    easy for them when they were little.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>On our way back to Africa, after home leave, we stopped in Scotland, England,
                    Romania, Turkey, and Egypt. In each place, except Egypt, we visited with
                    friends. This is one of the advantages that we got from serving in Africa. As we
                    traveled to and from, we always went through Europe, except the first time when
                    we flew on Pan Am. Later, Pan Am ended its service to Africa, and there were no
                    other American airlines flying there. Consequently, we had to go through Europe.
                    And we always stopped off in some part of Europe, going or coming.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So now you're arriving, and it isn't even Cape Town-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or Johannesburg, which are the two biggest cities in

                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Pretoria, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which struck me as a bit provincial.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Well, in many ways, it was, but it was the executive capital of the
                    government of South Africa. Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State was the
                    judicial capital, and Cape Town the legislative capital. These divisions were
                    made when the two former Boer republics, the Transvaal and the Orange Free
                    State, were joined with the British colonies of Natal and the Cape to form the
                    Union of South Africa in 1910. Because Pretoria was the seat of the government,
                    the embassies were located there.</p>
                <p>We arrived there in September of...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nineteen seventy-two?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: Seventy-two. Prime Minister John Vorster, [pronounced “f�r'stur,”] and
                    his Afrikaner party, the National party, ruled South Africa, and ruled it with
                    an iron hand. In the three years that we were there, South Africa become
                    increasingly isolated in the world, and movement for reform grew, even within
                    the Afrikaner community itself. But the essential features of apartheid remained
                    in place and in force. Laws, such as the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, the
                    Immorality Act, the Terrorism Act, the Population Registration Act, the Group
                    Areas Act, the Bantu Education Act, all of these laws regimented how and where
                    blacks could live and work and kept them in a state of subjugation. They were by
                    far the majority population. South Africa's population in those days was
                    something like 30 million, of which 25 plus million were Africans. You had about
                    a million coloreds, half a million or so Asians, and the white population was
                    around three million, but the whites ruled the country and controlled the
                    economy.</p>
                <p>Living in South Africa was a major contrast to our experiences in Zanzibar,
                    Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. For one thing, the climate was temperate, not
                    tropical. Being in South Africa was like being in a western European country,
                    having all the material advantages that one could want - restaurants, theaters,
                    cinemas, bookstores, shopping centers. Juxtaposed with this bright affluence was
                    the abject living conditions of the Africans, who were prohibited from living in
                    the white areas. They would come into the white areas and work as domestics or
                    in various menial jobs for the most part, but then go back to townships (black
                    townships around the bigger cities where they lived) at the end of the working
                    day. We enjoyed the creature comforts. It would be hypocritical to say
                    otherwise. But it was not easy living in the apartheid society because of what
                    we saw on a daily basis, and what we knew what was happening.</p>
                <p>Q: I assume also, Don, that other than your international friends with other
                    embassies to the extent that you socialized with white South Africans, they were
                    always a little bit after you to agree with them and to tell them that the way
                    they were living was not that bad. There's a lot of stress in this when you're
                    trying to live with people and get along with them on the one hand, but you
                    totally disagree with their opinions and their outlook. Were Julie and you able
                    to find the modus vivendi?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. The topic of apartheid came up in every conversation. White South
                    Africans, especially the Afrikaners, wanted to explain to you, to convince you
                    that system was right. They were looking for some kind of sympathy. They thought
                    their system was right and that they could explain to you and you would accept
                    that. That wasn't the case, however. For three straight years, we heard about
                    apartheid and we observed its effects day in and day out. After the end of the
                    three years, as much as we had enjoyed many aspects of our life in South Africa,
                    we were ready to leave. We had no home leave, only local leave, during those
                    three years. South Africa was not considered a hardship post, and in
                    non-hardship posts home leave was granted only if the assignment was for four or
                    more years. We traveled a lot in South Africa and also visited Lesotho and
                    Swaziland.</p>

                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. In the political section, we followed white politics, race
                    relations, the manifestations of apartheid, and other internal matters, South
                    Africa's foreign affairs, and also political developments in the trust territory
                    of South West Africa, as Namibia was called then. We had contacts with
                    Afrikaners, people in the government, people outside the government, opponents
                    of the government, South Africans of English stock (whose main political home
                    was the United party in opposition to the government), and the ultraliberal
                    Progressive party. We had contact with blacks from various walks of life and,
                    when we were in Cape Province, with Coloreds and Asians. We reached out, as any
                    good embassy should do, to all segments of the population so that we could
                    understand what was going on and report accurately, and have a solid basis for
                    our analyses of what was going on in South Africa.</p>
                <p>South West Africa was a fascinating place. Because the United Nations and the
                    United States did not recognize South Africa's claim to administer this trust
                    territory of South West Africa, Washington did not allow embassy officers to go
                    there. However, when in 1972 there was a high-profile treason trial of several
                    Africans in Windhoek, the capital of South West Africa, an embassy officer was
                    sent there. After the trial was over, we made a decision to keep covering events
                    within the territory. Only one officer was permitted to do that, and I took that
                    portfolio (maybe a little selfishly, but I took it anyway).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it's interesting. It gives you a chance to
                        travel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. I went there several times a year, roamed around the territory,
                    talked to people, and met with, for example, leaders of the various tribal
                    components of South West Africa, including some who were outspoken critics of
                    the South African government. I met with white opposition figures as well, and
                    with government officials, journalists, and business people. I had a great time
                    and saw a lot of the fascinating territory, including the Namib Desert (which is
                    one of the few pure deserts of the world), the barren Skeleton Coast along the
                    Atlantic, the salt pans of the north, and the massive sand dunes at Swakopmund.
                    It was fascinating to be able to go there and associate with the people, and
                    report on what was occurring.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me take you back just a second. You said that on your
                        tripto Windhoek you were able to talk with people in the opposition?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or that is to say the part of the independence people, but
                        I gather not then, the main independence movement. But my question is, the
                        South Africans did not object to your doing that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: They didn't like it, but they were not in a position to object or to
                    restrict my travel. They did, however, when I first started going down there,
                    put a tail on me. Everywhere I went somebody was behind me. It was very clumsily
                    done. One day I'd gone out to the township just outside Windhoek for a meeting
                    with an important African. On the way back I saw that I was being tailed, and I
                    stopped my car and got out. The car following me stopped too, and in it was
                    sitting this guy who was intently reading a newspaper [laughter]. I went up to
                    him and said, “What are you doing? This is so ridiculous!” I told him, “I'm
                    going to tell your superiors about this!” So I did. I went to someone in the
                    South African administrative authority and told him what had happened. I said
                    that they really ought to call this whole thing off; it was silly. Well, whether
                    they did or not, whether they removed the surveillance or not, I'm not sure, but
                    I never saw anybody tailing me again. I took pains to be able to know whether
                    anybody was searching my room in the hotel, and I never found any evidence of
                    that.</p>
                <p>As I said, living in South Africa was very comfortable. In Pretoria we had a very
                    comfortable, large house in a section of town called Waterkloof. For the first
                    time in our lives, we had a swimming pool, which the kids loved, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good schools for your children?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: We put the kids into schools. They had to go to separatschools,
                    because the white schools were not coeducational.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Day school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Day school, yes. John went to a school calleWitwatersrand Preparatory
                    School and the girls went to Loreto Convent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They all had uniforms?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: They all had uniforms. We had arrived in September, and in January it
                    was time to move to Cape Town. The children had to be taken out of school, after
                    these very few months, and go down to Cape Town. Every January the government
                    moved to Cape Town, where the legislature had its six-month session.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Embassies varied in how they covered this. For some of them, only one
                    person would go, the ambassador in some cases, another officer in others. Other
                    embassies would send more personnel. For our part, the ambassador, the DCM, the
                    political section, three secretaries, and a communicator went to Cape Town every
                    year. This meant packing up, moving, getting into our new house, and getting the
                    kids into schools. It was a bit disruptive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that's tough.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: But I tell you, living in Cape Town, which is one of the most
                    beautiful cities in the world, was a definite bonus. Our house and surroundings
                    in Cape Town were even better than in Pretoria. We lived in a large old house
                    called Tembane (pronounced Timbonnie) in Claremont, a lovely suburb of the city.
                    It was than a half-hour by train into the city. I commuted by train every
                    day.</p>
                <p>The political section covered the parliamentary session and race relations in
                    Cape Province, where most of South African's Coloreds and Asians lived. The
                    children seemed happy in their new schools. We all enjoyed the magnificent
                    scenery - Table Mountain and the ocean.</p>
                <p>In June of 1973, the parliamentary session ended, and we moved back to Pretoria.
                    This time, however, we left Susan, our eldest, in boarding school in Cape Town.
                    She didn't want to leave her school. After the next move, we would leave all
                    three children in Cape Town. It was just too hard on them, moving back and
                    forth, and they liked their schools in Cape Town better than the schools in
                    Pretoria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The State Department was okay with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Oh, yes, sure. Most children, certainly the older children, did stay
                    in Cape Town - Bob Smith's kids, for example. We had an allowance to cover this.
                    It was hard for Julie and me because, unlike the British, we were not accustomed
                    to sending our children off to boarding school from time they were six, seven,
                    or eight years of age. But it turned out that the separation wasn't for six
                    months at a stretch because they could come back to Pretoria on school holidays.
                    We saw them every couple of months during the separation.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>Q: But that's interesting, you know. It must be one of the few situations in the
                    world where Foreign Service people can send their children to private boarding
                    school in the same country?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>I mentioned earlier that an important part of our work in South Africa was
                    reaching out to the African community as well as to other communities and
                    promoting black-white association. Julie and I gave dinner parties to which we
                    invited whites and non-whites. This could have been awkward, but invariably our
                    guests seemed to be fascinated rather than angered or repelled or even
                    uncomfortable. One time the wife of an Afrikaner cabinet minister told us, as
                    she was leaving the house after a dinner, that it was the first time that she
                    had ever sat down for a dinner with blacks, and she thanked us for arranging the
                    dinner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. It had been standard practice for embassy officers to visit black
                    townships. The DCM - Bob Smith - and I decided to stop getting prior permission
                    from the government. This had been SOP, standard operating procedure. But we
                    decided, “Look, we have a right to roam around the country as diplomats, just as
                    South African diplomats can roam around the country in the United States. We
                    don't need to get this permission.” So we stopped doing it. The South African
                    government may not have been happy, but they didn't interfere.</p>
                <p>One night Julie and I took the children with us when we went to the home of an
                    African family in a township outside Pretoria, Guguleatu. The husband was a
                    personnel officer of a large, white-owned company. Certainly he could be
                    considered upper middle class in many ways. Our visit gave our children a chance
                    to see what kind of living conditions a middle class black family had to accept
                    under apartheid. The house, which had hardly any space for a yard, was tiny and
                    there was no running water.</p>
                <p>Q: Wow! I would like to ask you, you know... One of the responsibilities of the
                    American embassy in South Africa at that time was to have as much contact as
                    possible with blacks. Of course, there wasn't any black opposition. There were
                    just the independence movements outside. But as political counselor, you're in
                    charge of managing these contacts. Tell us a little bit about how you did that,
                    and particularly whether it was easier to do it in Cape Town than it was in
                    Pretoria.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: No, it wasn't easier in Cape Town than in Pretoria, as I recall. As
                    far as managing the contacts, there was nothing for me to do, for we had capable
                    people in our consulates who knew what to do and how to do it. This was
                    particularly true in Johannesburg. Soweto, just outside the city, was the most
                    populous and most important black township. The consulate had a very good
                    program of mixing with blacks and reaching out to them, of having cultural and
                    social affairs to bring blacks and whites together. All three consulates and the
                    embassy did a tremendous job in this regard.</p>
                <p>Q: It's just that my image is that Pretoria is a smaller town with somewhat
                    stricter rules and customs, whereas Cape Town with the Cape colored population,
                    race relations always sort of seemed easier in Cape Town.</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: They were in a sense, but recall that not long before this time, the
                    government had forced the Cape Coloreds out of District Six, their traditional
                    living space in Cape Town, and moved them out to the sandy, barren Cape flats,
                    which was very hard on them. So the government wasn't any easier on non-whites
                    there than they were in Pretoria. There was a more liberal attitude on the part
                    of many Cape whites toward race and toward other things, and there was a lot of
                    criticism of the government. We enjoyed going to theaters where comedians would
                    lampoon the government. Some of this occurred in Pretoria and Johannesburg as
                    well, but Cape Town was a bit easier. Still the basic problem of apartheid
                    existed there, as it existed throughout the country.</p>
                <p>One of the things I remember was a tendency on the part of political pundits and
                    other observers of South Africa to predict that Armageddon was just around the
                    corner. Some people in the State Department shared this theory. We in the
                    embassy periodically shot that down. It fell on me as the political counselor to
                    articulate the reasons why Armageddon wasn't imminent. Which wasn't saying that
                    apartheid would not end some day, just that we didn't believe that it would end
                    soon and in a cataclysm of violence.</p>
                <p>We went back to Cape Town for the next session of Parliament in January 1974.
                    Because of the country's extreme gasoline shortage, we traveled on the Blue
                    Train from Pretoria down to Cape Town. The Blue Train was one of the world's
                    last luxury trains. It was a wonderful one-day trip that we were able to enjoy
                    because there was no alternative and the Department paid our way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How come a gas shortage?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: We're talking about 1974. There was the widespread OPEC-induced
                    shortage of gasoline that affected many countries, the U.S. included.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Along with the overall shortage, South Africa waparticularly hard hit
                    because oil producers were blacklisting it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: There were going to be parliamentary elections later that year, which
                    meant that the parliament would reconvene again earlier then in January of '75,
                    so we and the others from the embassy who went to Cape Town stayed there after
                    the end of the parliamentary session in June. It was nice for us, for my family,
                    for Julie and me to have the kids under our roof for most of that year.</p>
                <p>In the elections the Progressive Party - which was the party of white liberals,
                    whose only member of Parliament had been Helen Suzman - gained a significant
                    number of seats. The Afrikaners' National Party retained its heavy majority, but
                    the Progressives now had a bigger voice for speaking out against government
                    policies. By contrast, the old-line opposition United Party lost seats, which
                    foreshadowed its later demise.An event of seminal importance to South Africa
                    took place in 1974. In Portugal, the dictatorship of Antonio Salazar was
                    overthrown, and soon afterward the Portuguese territories in Africa were
                    decolonized. This removed the buffer states of Mozambique and Angola, which had
                    provided a kind of protection for the white regimes in Southern Africa, and gave
                    stimulus to black liberation movements. That year and the next, the
                    international and domestic pressures for change in South Africa increased. It
                    was becoming more isolated. Apartheid was a long ways from finished, but it was
                    unraveling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've finished up with three years in Pretoria. What
                        happennow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Well, the system of bidding on assignments was still unknown in the
                    Foreign Service. In the spring of 1975, I waited to hear what my next assignment
                    was going to be. One day I got a phone call from Winston Lord, whom I didn't
                    know. He told me he wanted me to join the Policy Planning Staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was he, at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Winston Lord was the director of the Policy Planning Staff. I knew
                    next to nothing about the Policy Planning Staff and its work. I told him that I
                    was a field hand and preferred working overseas. I indicated that I wasn't much
                    of a conceptualizer and didn't think I was the person for a job in policy
                    planning.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>Well, he disagreed with me. He said he knew about my work and he wanted me to be
                    the African specialist on the Policy Planning Staff. Had I known how prestigious
                    the Policy Planning Staff was, as I learned soon afterward, instead of being
                    nonplused, I would have been very flattered by Win's call.</p>
                <p>We left Cape Town early that summer, stopping in Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar and
                    in Europe on our way home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were going back without any ongoing
                        assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Oh, no. I was assigned to the Policy Planning Staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were? Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. Once again, I was in no position to say, “No, I won't take it.” I
                    began my job in Washington as the African specialist on the Policy Planning
                    Staff in late July. For the second time, I replaced Bill De Pree, who had been
                    my predecessor at Sierra Leone. Actually, in Policy Planning I replaced both
                    Bill De Pree and Herbert Spiro, a civilian African specialist from academia.</p>
                <p>Under Henry Kissinger, who by then was Secretary of State, the Policy Planning
                    Staff was an exciting place to work in. He used it as a think tank, as an
                    instrument for shaping foreign policies, and he drew on the people in Policy
                    Planning for policy ideas and to articulate them in his speeches. The work was
                    interesting and challenging, and after a while I enjoyed it. At first, though, I
                    was apprehensive, not at all used to an unstructured kind of job, which it was.
                    It was up to me to generate ideas for consideration. I remember sitting at my
                    desk, with nothing on it and staring at the wall [laughter] for a long, long
                    time. But I got used to the new scene, and I found it to be invigorating.
                    Particularly enjoyable was the collegiality that Win Lord encouraged.</p>
                <p>Winston had come from the outside; he was not a career Foreign Service officer.
                    He was extremely bright, extremely able, and was the buffer between the very
                    difficult Dr. Kissinger and the rest of us.</p>
                <p>I did my first paper on the Transkei, which was one of the large “Bantustans,”
                    creations of the South African government as separate enclaves for black South
                    Africans. Even those Africans who worked in the white areas and lived in
                    townships were forced to be citizens of a Bantustan, or “homeland, which the
                    South Africans were now calling them. Within the Ford administration, some
                    consideration was being given to doing something, I can't recall just what, that
                    might be construed as giving some legitimacy to the Transkei. The South Africans
                    were pushing for this. I urged Secretary Kissinger to reject any such move.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or other Bantustans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Correct. South Africans were actively promoting the idea that the
                    Bantustans would become more and more autonomous - the Ciskei, the Transkei,
                    KwaZulu, and the others. The South African government had embarked on a campaign
                    trying to win international acceptance of the Bantustan concept. They used
                    compliant African tribal leaders in South Africa to help sell the idea.</p>
                <p>Kissinger either had no intention of going in that direction in any event or he
                    agreed with my paper, for in the end, the U.S. did nothing to be of assistance
                    to the South Africans on that score. You have to remember, Kissinger's decision
                    was not all that cut and dried. This was during the Cold War and South Africa
                    was regarded as an ally. The United States government did not have an
                    antagonistic relationship with South Africa in the years of the Nixon and Ford
                    administrations. U.S. policy toward South Africa was called “communication
                    without acceptance.” Communication without acceptance was much the same as the
                    “constructive engagement” of the Reagan administration. Nevertheless, the
                    administration was wise enough to know that it was not in the interest of the
                    U.S. government to be seen as embracing the South Africans. We had to consider
                    our relations with black African countries. Furthermore, the administration had
                    to be sensitive to the feelings and opinions of African Americans, who would
                    have been angered by any action that could be taken as acquiescence in an
                    apartheid.</p>
                <p>I made a point of keeping in close touch with the African Bureau. Kissinger let
                    it be known that he didn't have confidence in the bureau. He looked to the
                    Policy Planning Staff for policy ideas rather than to the bureau. This put me in
                    a ticklish position because my home bureau was the African Bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say that Kissinger didn't have confidence in the
                        AfricaBureau, could you explain that a little bit more fully?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: It's hard for me to say, for I was not at all privy to his thinking.
                    But apparently he had concluded that the bureau was not giving him the kind of
                    judgments and thinking that he wanted, that he needed. At any rate, I was in the
                    middle and it was, as I said, an uncomfortable situation for me now and then. I
                    kept in close touch with the bureau all the time, conferred with the assistant
                    secretary, his deputies, and office directors. I attended the assistant
                    secretary's weekly staff meeting, for example.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>Writing a speech for Secretary Kissinger was an experience. He used speeches as a
                    method of articulating a new policy or modifying an old policy, so his speeches
                    were extremely important. He looked to the Policy Planning Staff to produce at
                    least the first draft containing the basic ideas for a policy speech. My first
                    attempt at writing a speech for him came that year. He ordered a draft for the
                    remarks he would give to a gathering of African ambassadors to the United
                    Nations in New York. So I sat down, wrote a draft, and gave it to Winston for
                    presentation to Kissinger. The next morning Win called me in. With him was Sam
                    Lewis, who was the principal deputy in Policy Planning. They told me that my
                    draft was a disaster. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Kissinger had panned the draft. It had marginal commentsuch as, “My
                    12-year-old son could do better!” or “This is pap!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I was taken aback. But they said I shouldn't worry about it. This was
                    standard procedure. Kissinger always, or almost always, did not accept a first
                    draft and would make nasty comments about it.</p>
                <p>I had 24 hours to come up with another draft. I remember working late into the
                    night, and it wasn't until after midnight that I completed writing the draft.
                    Sometime during the course of the day, Win and Sam told me that Kissinger had
                    liked the draft!</p>
                <p>Kissinger was a very difficult man to work for, which was too bad. He had many
                    good qualities. Here he was secretary of state, and for the first time in some
                    years, the secretary of state had clout with the President. William Rogers had
                    had none. The Department had welcomed Kissinger. He could have gotten so much
                    more out of his subordinates if he had treated them halfway decently, but that
                    wasn't his way. He seemed to delight in chewing out subordinates, and he was
                    often incredibly scathing in his criticism.</p>
                <p>Winston acted as a buffer between Policy Planning Staff members and Kissinger.
                    After approving what had been written on an issue, Win present it to Kissinger,
                    arguing, when necessary, it its favor. Win was one of three people in the
                    Department who could stand up to the Secretary, argue with him, and not be
                    bothered by his flak. Larry Eagleburger and Helmut Sonnenfeldt were the other
                    two. He respected them and needed them, and he knew it.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>I once attended a meeting in which he heaped scorn on an under secretary of state
                    and an assistant secretary of state or two. I was by far the most junior person
                    at the meeting and was sitting at the other end of the table. He yelled at them.
                    At one point he got up, threw his pencil down on the table, and stalked out of
                    the room. [Laughter]He was enormously talented, as I said, but he was not
                    beloved of his troops, and he could have been, if he had used the charm that he
                    was known for and that he turned on for presidents and prime ministers and
                    others. He would have gotten great respect and loyalty and, I believe, better
                    results from his subordinates.</p>
                <p>In 1976, as the end of his tenure drew near, Kissinger decided to go to Africa
                    for the first time. He told Winston that he did not want to make just a
                    ceremonial visit. He wanted ideas for a major foreign policy speech. Many of my
                    colleagues in the African Bureau and I had long disagreed with the Nixon-Ford
                    policy for southern Africa - a policy that kept the United States away from
                    involvement in the Rhodesian conflict, for example. I sketched out some ideas on
                    changes to the policy and worked with Winston and his two deputies at that time,
                    Nick Veliotes and Reginald Bartholomew, to figure out how-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sam Lewis had moved on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Sam had moved on. The idea was to figure out how to convince Kissinger
                    to buy the idea of changing the current policy to one that would favor eventual
                    majority rule in South Africa, independence and black majority rule in Rhodesia,
                    and a true road to independence for Namibia. The core of the argument that we
                    used, and which prevailed with Kissinger, was that attempts whites in southern
                    Africa to maintain the status quo in South Africa, Rhodesia, and Namibia, would
                    be to the benefit of the Soviet Union. I argued that the Soviets would...or we
                    argued, I should say, because Nick and Reggie worked a lot with me to produce
                    this paper. We argued that the Soviet Union would capitalize on the turmoil that
                    would come from increased armed resistance to the white regimes. Kissinger
                    agreed that this made sense, and it fell to me to draft a policy speech, which I
                    did. To my surprise, and to Win's also, Kissinger was pleased with my first
                    draft. It eventually would undergo modifications, including polishing by
                    Kissinger's principal speechwriters, but the essence of what I wrote remained in
                    the speech, which he delivered in Lusaka, Zambia in late April of 1976.As I
                    mentioned to you, the United States had viewed South Africa somewhat benignly
                    during the Nixon and Ford presidencies. And Washington neither gave support to
                    southern African liberation movements nor publicly endorsed majority rule for
                    the region. Therefore, Kissinger made quite a splash when, in Lusaka, he made a
                    ringing declaration of an unequivocal U.S. commitment to majority rule and equal
                    rights for all the people of southern Africa. He declared U.S. support for a
                    rapid, negotiated settlement leading to majority rule in Rhodesia. He outlined
                    ten steps to achieve that in two or three years and he called upon South Africa
                    to take steps to move Namibia down the road to self-determination. This was a
                    real departure from existing U.S. policy. Kissinger's speech electrified his
                    audience in Lusaka and won praise from a number of African leaders.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I was, and I got some credit for the speech among people in Washington
                    who followed African affairs. This turned out to do me no harm when the new
                    administration came in. When President Carter took office in 1977-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, just a second.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Oh, sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: May I just ask you, did you ever have any contact
                        witKissinger? Did he ever say anything to you about this speech?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I had attended a meeting or two that he chaired, but had only a couple
                    of one-on-one encounters with him. When he came back from his African trip, he
                    ran into some flak on the Capitol Hill from conservative Republicans who felt he
                    had been too hard on the Rhodesian government. Among other things that he said
                    in Lusaka, he had stated the intention of the Ford Administration to call for
                    repeal of the Byrd Amendment, which allowed the importation of chrome from
                    Rhodesia, an exception to the embargo against Rhodesian products. His prepared
                    statement for his hearing included, as I recall, an indication that he was
                    backing down from that. I was unhappy with the draft and I said so to Win Lord.
                    Win passed this on to Kissinger and, to my surprise, he summoned me to his
                    office. He showed some new draft language for his remarks and asked me how this
                    would sell in Africa.</p>
                <p>I started out by saying it would have some negative repercussions in the United
                    States. He said, “I don't want to hear from you about American politics. I want
                    to know how the Africans will react.”</p>
                <p>So I told him that it would have a very negative effect in Africa.</p>
                <p>He chewed on this for a moment, thanked me, and that was the end oit.</p>
                <p>The only other time that we spoke directly was when the Policy Planning Staff
                    gave him a farewell party when he was leaving office. All of us members were
                    there. Some of us admired Kissinger; some of us despised him. I was sort of
                    neutral, I guess. At any rate, he said goodbye to each of us individually. He
                    came up to me, and said, “And what are you going to do?” I replied, “Mr.
                    Secretary, I'm going to become a missionary in Africa.” Deadpan, he said, “That
                    would be appropriate.” [Laughter]</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>Q: [Laughter] Well, it's too bad that he didn't have any graceful words for you
                    after that speech, which I remember was really a surprise. We really made an
                    impression.</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I did get a fair amount of credit for it, and, as I started to say
                    earlier, it didn't do me any harm when the Carter people came in. Tony Lake
                    became the head of Policy Planning. This was in early 1977. He asked me to stay
                    on, which I did. The priority that Carter gave to Africa was shown in the fact
                    that the third foreign policy decision memorandum of the new administration was
                    devoted to Southern Africa. I guess it was a sign of the confidence that they
                    had in me that I was asked to draft this memorandum. The norm was that a policy
                    paper of this kind would be a joint product with input from various parties. But
                    I drafted the whole thing myself, and it stayed largely intact.</p>
                <p>Tony wanted to keep me in Policy Planning, but that spring I was asked to become
                    the director of the Office of Southern African Affairs, which was the busiest
                    office in the African Bureau, and one of the busiest in all the State
                    Department. The countries for which we had responsibility in AF/S were Botswana,
                    Lesotho, Swaziland, South Africa, Mozambique, Rhodesia, and Namibia. South
                    Africa, Rhodesia, and Namibia were all big issues, and all demanded a lot of
                    work and a lot of time. I was fortunate to have very able desk officers, people
                    like Jeffrey Davidow, who had worked in my political section in South Africa,
                    and who was an enormously - [laughter] he was an enormous guy, about six foot
                    six or so - enormously talented officer, with great personal and intellectual
                    skills. He went on to become, eventually, assistant secretary of state for Latin
                    America Affairs, and he is now ambassador to Mexico. My deputy was Dennis Keogh,
                    who also was very able and who later would be killed in a terrorist bombing in
                    Namibia.</p>
                <p>The Carter administration took up on South Africa, Rhodesia, and Namibia where
                    Kissinger had left off. But it took a more aggressive stance toward South
                    Africa. That year, 1977, Vice President Mondale went to South Africa to talk to
                    John Vorster. I spent some time with the Vice President, briefing him. While he
                    was in South Africa, he was asked by a reporter whether he supported the idea of
                    “one man, one vote.” He had not gone to South Africa intending to talk about
                    “one man, one vote” explicitly, for that would have made it impossible for him
                    to have any kind of useful interaction with the South Africans. He had, of
                    course, expressed the American policy of support for majority rule. “One man,
                    one vote” was a dirty phrase to white South Africans, and it even turned off
                    some liberals. But Mondale, faced directly with the question, answered
                    forthrightly. “Yes, we support 'one man, one vote'.” U.S. relations with South
                    Africa remained pretty frosty throughout the years of the Carter administration,
                    not because of the Mondale response, but because of the administration's strong
                    position against apartheid. Aspects of that position were initially framed in
                    AF/S, which gave me and others in the office considerable scope for working on
                    policy issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>The administration actively pursued and negotiated settlements for Rhodesia and
                    Namibia. I became closely associated with Assistant Secretary of State Richard
                    Moose. He had started out in the administration as under secretary for
                    management, but moved over to take the African portfolio. Wayne Fredericks, who
                    had been a deputy assistant secretary in the African bureau during the Kennedy
                    administration and had worked in Africa for the Ford Foundation, had been
                    offered the position. But he was hit by a car while crossing a street in London.
                    In the hospital, he felt too incapacitated to accept the assistant secretary
                    job. He later regretted his decision because he fully recovered.</p>
                <p>Q: I was a desk officer in the African Bureau several years before, when Soapy
                    Williams was Assistant Secretary, and Wayne Fredericks was his principal
                    Deputy-</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. Wayne was a very able person. Because of the immediacy and
                    prominence of African issues, especially southern African issues, the
                    administration wanted a replacement for Fredericks right away, and Dick Moose
                    was chosen.</p>
                <p>Moose and I traveled to London a number of times for talks with British Foreign
                    Secretary David Owen on the Rhodesia question. I also traveled a great deal
                    withAmbassador Donald McHenry. The United States and the other Western members
                    of the UN Security Council, which then were West Germany, Britain, France, and
                    Canada, joined together in an effort to negotiate with South Africa for
                    Namibia's independence. Don McHenry, who was the deputy U.S. permanent
                    representative to the United Nations, was another extraordinarily capable person
                    from whom I learned a lot. He was a superb negotiator. We traveled together
                    several times to Africa, participating in talks in various eastern and southern
                    African capitals, talking to government leaders, getting ideas, enlisting
                    support for the efforts of the “Gang of Five” (as the Security Council
                    negotiating team was called). Because McHenry was so able, and hard working as
                    well, by tacit agreement of the other members of the Gang of Five (who
                    recognized his abilities), he was our lead negotiator. It was interesting to see
                    him in talks with John Vorster, the very gruff Afrikaner prime minister.
                    Strangely enough, the two learned to appreciate each other. It was obvious that
                    Vorster came to admire McHenry. And Don told me one day, “You know, I kind of
                    like the old son of a bitch!” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>Q: I think we ought to interject, just for those who are not that familiar with
                    foreign affairs, that Don McHenry was black. Meetings between Vorster and him
                    had these racial undertones, right?</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, and it's again a measure of McHenry's abilities that he won the
                    respect of, not only the prime minister, but also the foreign minister and
                    everyone else he came in contact with, even though they didn't like what he
                    said. He was a tough negotiator, and they respected him. I believe, and so do
                    some others who were involved in those negotiations, that the effort of the Gang
                    of Five would have produced an agreement for Namibian independence. But near the
                    end of the Carter administration, the South Africans stalled, waiting to see
                    what the outcome of the American election would be, figuring that they could get
                    a better deal from a Republican administration. And so Namibia did not move to
                    independence before the end of the Carter administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The opportunity passed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: It took several years for Chester Crocker, who became the assistant
                    secretary of state for African affairs in the Reagan years, to accomplish it. He
                    finally won the kind of independence that the Namibians and the rest of the
                    world were seeking for South West Africa.</p>
                <p>In 1978, Dick Moose asked me to replace Bill Edmondson, one of the Africa
                    Bureau's deputy assistant secretaries of state. Bill had been named ambassador
                    to South Africa. So it was that I was elevated from AF/S to become a deputy
                    assistant secretary. Much of my time in that job was still taken up with the
                    southern African issues, which were so paramount in the foreign policy
                    priorities of the Carter administration in those years. I had been a DAS (deputy
                    assistant secretary) for only a short time when, for family reasons, it became
                    important to Julie and me to try to go back overseas. One day while flying to
                    London with Dick Moose, I talked to him about this. He readily agreed that
                    family came first, and we talked about possible overseas jobs. By that time I
                    had been immersed in southern African affairs for six years, and I wanted a
                    change. When Dick noted that our ambassador to Somalia would soon be ending his
                    assignment and said that might be a possibility, I said that I would definitely
                    be interested. When we returned to Washington, he talked to Secretary Vance, and
                    my candidacy for the ambassadorship to Somalia was launched.</p>
                <p>Let me say that Mr. Vance was a breath of fresh air after the prickliness of
                    Henry Kissinger. Not only was Cyrus Vance an extremely able man, but also he was
                    someone who treated others with decency and respect, and who listened to the
                    views of his subordinates. He was very accessible. I was enormously pleased to
                    get to know him and to be associated with him, to travel with him on one or two
                    occasions. Those of us who worked for Cy Vance were totally loyal to him.</p>
                <p>My nomination to become ambassador to Somalia did not have clear sailing. First,
                    Senators Hayakawa of California, Garn and Hatch of Utah, and Jesse Helms of
                    North Carolina held it up in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hayakawa? I mean California's your home state! PETTERSON:
                        Right! [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's going on here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: The senators and other conservatives were displeased that the
                    administration was not keen to issue a visa to Ian Smith, who was the white
                    prime minister of Rhodesia and who wanted to visit the United States at that
                    time. So the four senators put a hold on my nomination and that of two other
                    Foreign Service officers who were waiting to get confirmed. However, before
                    long, the administration decided to give Smith a visa, not because of this
                    holdup on the nominations, but for other reasons. Hayakawa, Garn, and Hatch
                    lifted their holds on all three nominations, but Jesse Helms kept his hold on
                    mine. It seems that he and his staff had concluded that I was the architect of
                    the Carter administration's southern African policy, which they did not like. So
                    I went up on the Hill to meet with Helms' staff aides and try to disabuse them,
                    and through them Helms, of that notion. During our talk, Helms' principal
                    staffer on the committee, John Carbo, he said that I seemed like a nice guy,
                    that he was sure I had a nice family, that I had a nice suit on, but [laughter]
                    they didn't like the southern African policy, and I was the guy who had made
                    that policy.</p>
                <p>I said, “Wait a minute!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I said, “What about Secretary Vance? What about Andy Young, (who was
                    then UN ambassador and who very much was involved in policy making)?” I said,
                    “What about Don McHenry? Tony Lake? Dick Moose?”</p>
                <p>Their response was, “Nope, you.”</p>
                <p>So I left the Hill with a hold still on my nomination, very upset. My parents
                    were coming out from California, and Julie and I had begun to make arrangements
                    for the move to Somalia, and there I was, stuck!</p>
                <p>Well, fortunately for me, Vice President Mondale, with whom I had worked with a
                    bit and who seemed to like me, and Secretary Vance came to my rescue and managed
                    to get Helms to back off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you call Mondale?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: No. I went back and talked to Moose, and we talked tSecretary
                    Vance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Both Mondale and Vance were angered by what Helms was doing. I don't
                    know what they did, but they got Helms to back off! [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Vance talked with Mondale about your nomination?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. And Jesse Helms backed off?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: And I was confirmed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it all remains a mystery? [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: You mean how they got him to back off?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, or what-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, I never knew exactly what they did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because, I mean, Senator Jesse Helms has later on put
                        holds oambassadorial nominations that lasted for months and months and
                        months.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, right, and he killed some of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Well, anyway, I now belonged to the list of distinguishepeople whose
                    nominations were held up by Jesse Helms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: In November 1978 Julie, John and I left for Mogadishu. Because the
                    international school there only went through the eighth grade, Susan and
                    Julianne went to boarding schools in New England.</p>
                <p>I presented my credentials to Somali President Mohamed Siad Barre a week after
                    our arrival. Siad had ruled Somalia since he seized power in a military coup in
                    1969. He had aligned Somalia closely with the Soviet Union. Life for American
                    diplomats in Sudan in the ensuing years was not easy, given the often hostile
                    environment set by Siad and his government. The Soviets poured in massive
                    military aid, and the Somali army became one of the largest and best equipped in
                    all of Africa.</p>
                <p>Somalia had always claimed that the Ogaden region of eastern Ethiopia was Somali
                    territory. In 1977, Ethiopia had become very much weakened by internal political
                    upheaval. Siad saw this as an opportunity and he invaded the Ogaden. The Soviets
                    were not happy. They had been angling for closer ties with the Marxist military
                    regime in Addis Ababa. They saw that Ethiopia was more important in Africa than
                    Somalia. So Siad and they had a falling out, and he threw out the Soviet
                    military advisory team and did other things to make life a bit tough for the
                    Soviets. Their embassy staff was scaled back considerably.</p>
                <p>Soon the Ethiopian military got the upper hand. The Soviets had, by then, been
                    providing the Ethiopians with military equipment. The Cubans intervened
                    militarily and actually had people on the ground helping the Ethiopian army
                    fight the Somalis. All this turned the tide against the Somali army. It was
                    defeated and withdrew most of its forces from the Ogaden in early 1978. Later
                    that year, President Carter agreed in principle to forge closer ties with
                    Somalia, if Siad Barre would get the rest of his army of the Ogaden. With the
                    Soviets firmly ensconced in Ethiopia, the Carter administration wanted to
                    prevent them from extending their influence further in the Horn of Africa. The
                    administration was wary of the duplicitous Siad Barre, but the enemy of my enemy
                    is my friend.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: The United States had no economic stake in Somalia. This was, after
                    all, a country mainly of herdsmen and whose major export was live animalcamels,
                    goats, and sheep. It had no mineral wealth and no commercial ties of any
                    significance with the United States. Its importance, or perceived importance,
                    stemmed entirely from a Cold War context, the concern about Soviet designs for
                    the Horn. In 1979, Soviet aggression in Afghanistan gave rise to fears that it
                    would expand its military presence into the northwest Indian Ocean area. As a
                    result, Somalia took on additional importance because of the American need for
                    Middle Eastern oil and Somalia's position at the entrance of the Red Sea and
                    along the two sea-lanes to the Persian Gulf.When I got to Mogadishu, the years
                    of Somalis' distrust of and hostility toward the United States had given way to
                    friendly relations. However, as I have said, Washington was wary of Siad, who
                    had shown time and again that he was not a man to be trusted. The administration
                    agreed to give him a modest amount of non-lethal military aid if he would
                    withdraw all of his forces from the Ogaden. He said he would do it. Well, for
                    almost the next three years, the leitmotif of my talks with Siad was U.S.
                    insistence that the Somalis had to get out of the Ogaden and Siad's insistence
                    that they had nobody there. So it was a standoff, and we did not provide him
                    with the military assistance he wanted or, for that matter, any military
                    assistance at all for some time.</p>
                <p>Q: I would suppose that from overhead photography and intelligence we had a
                    fairly good idea of whether Siad had any assets there or not. When you pointed
                    out to him that he had assets there, and we knew that he did, what did he say?
                    [Laughter]</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Well, that is precisely it. We had intelligence from overhead imagery
                    and from other means to know that there were Somali army personnel fighting with
                    the Western Somali Liberation Front in the Ogaden, no question about it. So I
                    would say, “Mr. President, you must get out of the Ogaden.”</p>
                <p>He would say, “I'm not in the Ogaden.”</p>

                <p>“How do you know?”</p>
                <p>“I can't tell you that, but we know you're in the Ogaden.”</p>

                <p>PETTERSON: And so it went. He would invariably deny our allegation and ask for
                    proof. Since proof was based on sensitive intelligence information, we never
                    gave it to him.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: He wasn't getting the aid he wanted. Siad was very accessible, and I
                    met with him a lot. He liked to meet with ambassadors, certainly with the
                    American ambassador. He was a night owl, so our meetings would generally take
                    place late at night. I never quite got used to the way my car would be greeted
                    at the gate of Siad's quarters. Armed soldiers would, as the car approached the
                    gate to the compound where Siad worked, suddenly leap forward out of the
                    darkness and level their weapons in our direction, yelling the Somali equivalent
                    of “Halt!” Once, I took some American journalists to see him about midnight. I
                    knew what was going to happen, but they didn't. When the guards pulled their
                    usual routine, the journalists in my car literally almost hit the roof.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I mean, they [laughter] were really shocked. My meetings with Siad
                    were just about always very informal. We often would sit in a gazebo during the
                    warm nights and drink lemonade or beer and talk for hours. This was clearly
                    designed to woo me to his side, and I took great pains not to develop a case of
                    “clientitis,” as can happen to an ambassador. And I was always candid with him.
                    One night he asked me why Washington didn't like him.</p>
                <p>I said, “Mr. President, do you really want to know?”</p>
                <p>“Yes, he replied.” “Well,” I said, “It's because you lie so much to us.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long would these sessions last?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Oh, sometimes two or three hours.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: There were times when, after a conversation, I would come home at two
                    or three o'clock in the morning. I would sit down while everything was fresh in
                    my mind and write my cable. I'd finish it maybe at the break of day or maybe it
                    was still dark, go out for a run, and then come back [laughter], have a shower,
                    eat breakfast, and go to work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter] Hwooh!</hi>

                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: I remember one night I went out for a run. Incidentally, I had no
                    security guards in Somalia. I wasn't a fanatic about running, not by any means,
                    but I had begun to run a fair amount. That night, I ran from my house, through
                    town, out to the Marine house and back again. I think the whole thing was maybe
                    six miles. At any rate, I was chugging along and went past the army air force
                    barracks, which is right near the international airport. It's pitch dark, I'm
                    running by, and I hear a voice. “Good evening, Mr. Ambassador.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: So they knew what I was doing. Maybe that was good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't Siad driving alongside you? PETTERSON: No!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Siad warned that if we didn't give him help, the Ethiopians might overrun his
                    country. He was always telling me about this or that air raid in northern
                    Somalia. He would claim that the Ethiopians were on the verge of attacking, and
                    admonished Washington for not helping him. He also played the Soviet card,
                    stating that we had to help him in the effort to withstand Soviet
                    expansionism.</p>
                <p>But Washington held firm to the demand that he get out of the Ogaden. Siad's
                    untrustworthiness and his unwillingness to get his military out of the Ogaden
                    did not, however, preclude an expansion of U.S. economic assistance and
                    humanitarian assistance to Somalia. One of my major efforts there was to keep
                    the proliferating U.S. presence from getting too large. We'd had enough examples
                    of too large an American presence and how it could redound to our detriment.
                    Iran, for example.</p>

                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: No, no. We had a growing USAID presence, with an AID staff and
                    American contractors for the various AID projects. The embassy staff wasn't all
                    that large, but it was expanding too. The mission had, as well, a USIS office
                    and a CIA station. And later, after a military aid agreement had been concluded,
                    we would have a military assistance team. But it was the AID component that was
                    the biggest element of the U.S. mission. Somalia became for a time the largest
                    recipient of U.S. aid in sub-Saharan Africa. Most of this was humanitarian aid
                    because of a huge refugee problem and drought. But our economic aid was growing
                    year by year. I tried to keep our AID mission focused on the core of our
                    program, which was in agriculture and primary health care. But AID had a
                    tendency to want to get into new things and to need more people to do those new
                    things. I opposed this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a good AID director?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: He seemed to be a good AID director, I thought. He knew his business.
                    But he and I disagreed about the scope of the AID program. That was a
                    professional disagreement, and it wasn't serious.</p>
                <p>Another disagreement I with him and with AID in Washington was over the formation
                    of a Joint Administrative Operation, called a JAO. The African Bureau, certainly
                    Dick Moose, was championing the idea of Joint Administrative Operations, which
                    would be more cost effective, require fewer personnel, and make sense from a
                    management standpoint. AID/Washington was dead set against it. They wanted to
                    continue to administer their own administration, to manage their own programs.
                    We're not talking about the AID projects. We're talking about the administration
                    of the entire U.S. mission program, of providing administrative
                    suppormaintenance, repairs, equipment, vehicles, supplies, all the
                    administrative needs. Having two separate administrative systems, one for AID
                    and another for the rest of the mission, was wasteful. I took up the cudgels on
                    this and fought the battle, which eventually was lost in Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>My differences with the USAID director regarding the JAO question and the growth
                    of the AID program were not a matter of serious discord between us. The problem
                    arose when he began openly voicing to Somalis harsh criticism of the U.S. policy
                    of not providing any military assistance as long as the Somali military were
                    still in the Ogaden. He sympathized with Somalis' viewpoint. Fair enough. But it
                    was not his place to tell the Somalis that American policy was ridiculous and to
                    make ad hominem remarks about Assistant Secretary Moose and Secretary Vance.
                    When I learned of this, I advised him to stop. He persisted. So, after a time I
                    had no choice, in my mind, but to have him removed from the country. If there
                    was a set bureaucratic procedure for doing this, I did not know it. I believed
                    that I was properly exercising my authority as ambassador. Before I informed the
                    AID director, I let the African bureau leadership know what I intended to do.
                    They voiced no objection. I called the AID director in, told him he had to
                    leave, notified Washington in a cable to State and to AID, and it was done.
                    AID/Washington was not happy. Perhaps I should have done it differently, but the
                    situation was intolerable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know, but my experience has been that the

                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: That's true.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he can send home anybody he wants.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, but in this day and age of grievances and lawsuits, I believe the
                    authority of the ambassador has been reduced. Today it might not possible for an
                    ambassador to do what I did.</p>
                <p>AID was furious, and they sent out an emissary, Roy Stacy, to deal with me on
                    this. Roy was a well regarded officer who later became a deputy assistant
                    secretary of state in the African Bureau. In the course of our conversation,
                    referring to the AID director, Roy told me, “You know, Don, this happened to him
                    once before in a southern African post, and he got bounced out.”</p>
                <p>I was incredulous. AID had known that and yet had made him a director again. They
                    had done so because he was part of the AID “old boy net.” Then, when he pulled
                    the same thing again, they got on their high horse when I expelled him. Well, in
                    any event, my decision stuck. I got a new AID director, Mike Adler, one of AID's
                    best officers, who had been AID director in Nigeria and elsewhere. Mike was a
                    wonderful man, and we quickly developed an excellent, cooperative working
                    relationship.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>So, 1979...impelled by the crises in Afghanistan Iran, in December the Carter
                    administration decided to seek military access to Somali, Kenyan, and Omani
                    ports and airfields. In Somalia, the Soviet-built airfield at Berbera, in the
                    northern part of the country along the Red Sea, was the longest and best landing
                    strip in the region. Washington believed it would be desirable to have access to
                    it, and negotiations ensued.</p>
                <p>They turned out to be protracted. We got what we wanted from the Kenyans and the
                    Omanis relatively quickly, but for two reasons it took longer in Somalia. First,
                    during the negotiations, it became clear again that Siad was still mucking
                    around in the Ogaden. That held things up. Then negotiations almost broke down
                    completely when Siad began making outlandish demands for billions of dollars of
                    offensive American military weaponry. When the cooling of U.S. ardor for an
                    agreement became apparent to Siad through his talks with me, he dropped his
                    demands and accepted the U.S. proposal for a modest amount of Foreign Military
                    Sales credits and economic support funds.</p>
                <p>In August 1980 an agreement was signed. But then we detected that the Somalis
                    were back in the Ogaden. The deal was off until a definitive Somali withdrawal
                    from the Ogaden, which finally was verified at the end of the year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is all before Diego Garcia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: No, about the same time.</p>
                <p>Siad would never get the amount or the kind of military aid that hwanted from
                    us.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, we never got what we were hoping for. We tried to talk him
                    into reforming Somalia's state-run economy, which featured large, corrupt,
                    inefficient state corporations. I tried to convince Siad to move toward a more
                    market-oriented economy. But he was married to the old ideas, and he didn't do
                    it, even though many of his advisors were urging him to do so. Those who urged
                    too much found themselves in trouble, and some left the country. I was naive to
                    think that we could convince Siad to do good things for the economic health of
                    Somalia. I was even more naive to think that he would begin to open his country
                    to a more democratic system. I thought we could convince him to do the right
                    thing, but he remained a dictator and persisted in squelching the rise of
                    democratic freedoms.</p>
                <p>In the cold war ethos of those days, however, those kinds of sins did not
                    override what Washington regarded as the need for an anti-Soviet friend. The
                    relationship was never that close, never what Siad wanted, and we never achieved
                    what we wanted, but we had reasonably good relationship for some years. The
                    bloom began to be off the rose in U.S.-Somali relations by the time I left, as
                    the initial enthusiasm on both sides had begun to pall.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>The fighting in the Ogaden and a severe drought in 1979 and 1980 produced a
                    massive refugee population, as tens of thousands of people flocked into camps in
                    northern Somalia. For a time, Somalia had the largest refugee population in the
                    world. The U.S. humanitarian aid program grew, and we were the largest single
                    donor to the substantial international aid effort. In 1981 the problem was made
                    even worse by massive flooding. Rains broke the drought but were so heavy that
                    they swelled the Shabeellee River to the point that thousands of people were
                    isolated and rendered homeless by the flooding.</p>
                <p>I spent a lot of my time on the AID problem and traveled to the refugee areas on
                    a number of occasions. A major difficulty arose when Somali officials tried to
                    dictate to the donors how the food aid would be delivered. If we had done what
                    they wanted, a lot of the food and other humanitarian supplies would have been
                    diverted. We wanted a system that would both relieve the growing congestion at
                    the port and expedite the delivery of food. We also wanted monitors in place at
                    the port, along the distribution route, and at the refugee camps. The Somalis
                    fought against this. Phil Johnston, my friend from Sierra Leone who was now the
                    executive director of CARE USA, came to Mogadishu to participate in talks. At
                    one point, with the talks going nowhere, he was on the verge of leaving the
                    country without an agreement. But we finally got the Somalis to agree that CARE
                    would be the NGO that would provide the expertise needed both for the port
                    operations and for delivery of the food supplies up-country. We also won the
                    battle for sufficient monitoring. We regarded this as a major accomplishment.
                    The new system wasn't perfect in its implementation, but it went a long way to
                    improve the situation a great deal.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Long time, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Three of our children were born there!</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were used to warm weather. I understand it's really
                        very hot in Somalia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Very hot, but not so bad along the coast. Mogadishu had coastal
                    breezes that cooled the temperature. Sometimes the winds were a problem.
                    Mogadishu is built on sand, and when the winds were strong, the sand was blown
                    everywhere. But, again, we liked our life in Somalia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do for fun out there? Are you a golfer or a
                        tenniplayer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Tennis. I played tennis and I ran. In Mogadishu I ran for the first
                    time with a group called the Hash House Harriers, which is internationally
                    known. There are Hash groups in places as disparate as Somalia and Washington
                    D.C. Hashing is less about serious running than it is about having a good time.
                    A trail is laid, you run the trail, you're given misleading signals, and you
                    circle back until you find the right trail again. In this way, the slowest
                    runners or those who choose to walk will catch up with the people who are
                    running hard. The idea is for everyone to finish the course at about the same
                    time. When you finish this nonsense, you have some food, drink beer if you're in
                    a country where beer is available, and sing silly songs. It was good harmless
                    fun and a welcome diversion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter] Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Because Mogadishu lacked the amenities and diversions of a prosperous
                    city, entertaining at home and being entertained by friends was the primary
                    social outlet for the diplomats there. Our Western community, as we styled it,
                    included ourselves, the British, French, Yugoslavs, and the [laughter] Chinese.
                    By then, as you know, our relationship with China had changed enormously. My
                    colleagues and I and our wives loved going to the Chinese because they served
                    great Chinese food!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: There were no restaurants that we could go to in town.</p>
                <p>Q: My image of Somalia is of a place sort of where opportunities for travel are
                    not too good and opportunities for cultural diversion are not too good-</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: That's true. You didn't travel for fun in Somalia. There were no
                    accommodations to speak of, or they were very rudimentary. The roads were bad.
                    The weather was bad. But my work dictated that I travel a lot, and I did by car
                    and sometimes by air. It was never a pleasure.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>But let me say again that we enjoyed being in Somalia. We had our friends and we
                    had such things as tennis, the Hash, taking the children to the beach - to a
                    beach that was safe. We couldn't go to the Lido beach in Mogadishu, right by our
                    house, because the sharks posed an extreme danger. People were killed by sharks
                    along Lido beach several times while we were there.</p>
                <p>Occasionally we would go to Nairobi, where we would stay with our friends Bill
                    and Ann Harrop. Bill was ambassador to Kenya at the time. Julie and I-</p>
                <p>Oh, I didn't mention that in July 1979, Julie gave birth to oufourth child, who

                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Well, no. She wanted to have the baby in Mogadishu, but her doctor
                    there said, “Don't do it, because if you have any problems, there are no
                    facilities here.” Which was true. The hospital was in deplorable shape. So she
                    went to Nairobi and had our fourth child, Brian, there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wow!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: And then they came back, and Brian began his life iSomalia. He was the
                    apple of everybody's eye, this little boy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a little younger than your three others, also.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: He was 14 years younger than the youngest of my others,14 years
                    younger than John.</p>
                <p>Julie was teaching in the American school, teaching kindergarten. She would take
                    Brian in a basket or in a carry-cot to school and do her teaching, which she
                    loved.</p>
                <p>By the end of 1982 it was time to move on.</p>

                        before wgo on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>Q: My impression is that the Somalis are a charming people, very attractive, very
                    good looking, and probably lots of fun to get to know. But, you know, 10 years
                    after you left, the United States is going in there because there's a really
                    chaotic situation. Why is it that these people are so bad at governing
                    themselves?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Let me explain why Somalia fell apart. First of all, there is a tribal
                    problem in Somalia. They don't call the tribes “tribes.” They call them “clans,”
                    but it's the same thing. Somalis have a common ancestry, speak the same
                    language, and have the same culture. But they were divided into clans, just as
                    the Scots were centuries ago, and fought each other for water rights, for
                    example. When Siad came to power, he played the clans off against each other to
                    keep them divided and help maintain himself in power. By exacerbating clan
                    rivalries, raising discontent by his autocratic ways, mishandling the economy,
                    giving no outlet for political expression, and holding on to power long after he
                    should have left, Siad laid the foundation for the chaos that came later. When
                    he was finally ousted, there ensued a battle for supremacy among these various
                    groups, all well armed and headed by men whose major aim was to seize power. All
                    this in a country where drought could strike at any time and cause more disaster
                    for the people. The fighting went on and on, as none of the warlords was able to
                    gain absolute ascendancy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: When the drought of the early 1990s came, international aid poured in,
                    but the fighting continue to rage. Eventually, as you know, the United States
                    intervened militarily, initially to help keep people alive, to stop the
                    appalling starvation.</p>
                <p>I had been told that I had done a good job in Somalia, and when we left there, I
                    was hoping to get another ambassadorship. But when I got back to Washington, I
                    found that I really no such prospect. With the change of administration and
                    consequent changes in the higher levels of the State Department, I was an
                    unknown quantity. To become an ambassador you need the blessing of the people
                    who comprise the “D Committee,” which is the deputy secretary's committee that
                    selects candidates for ambassadorships. If you've been overseas, as I had been,
                    or for any other reason are not personally known to any of the people who are on
                    the D Committee, and if you don't have the strong backing of your home bureau,
                    your prospects are not good. And I also found that the leading lights in
                    Personnel at that time couldn't have cared less about making me an ambassador
                    again. They had many other people, as well as their own careers, to worry about.
                    No one had even gone to the trouble to work on an alternative assignment for me.
                    I was in limbo.</p>
                <p>Q: And you didn't know the Reagan nominees to the D Committee?</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: No, I didn't know the secretary of state, who was not on the D
                    Committee, but who approved their recommendations or turned them down. I didn't
                    know the deputy secretary, the under secretary for management, the under
                    secretary for political affairs, or any other member of the committee. Nor was I
                    close to the assistant secretary for African affairs. So, again, when I got back
                    to Washington, I found there was nothing for me. The director of personnel told
                    me, “Well, if you can arrange something with a university, why don't you do
                    that!”</p>
                <p>So, I did. I called a friend, Michael Lochie, a professor at UCLA who was head of
                    the African studies program there. He said he would be delighted if I could come
                    out there. The Department paid my family's and my way to California and paid my
                    salary while I was there. I was a “visiting distinguished scholar” at UCLA. I
                    told people, “Well, at least the first adjective is correct.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: It turned out to be a good year. I lectured a bit, but not much. There
                    was no place for me in the political science department for lecturing that year.
                    I did a lot of research at UCLA's wonderful library.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: On African affairs. I wrote an article, which was published by an
                    international journal, on U.S. policy toward Ethiopia during the change from
                    Haile Selassie to Mengistu. I wrote a chapter for a book, African Crisis Areas
                    and U.S. Foreign Policy. So I did research, wrote, gave a few lectures, and
                    counseled students from time to time.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you working mostly, Don, with undergraduates or with graduate
                    students?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Both, but not a lot of students. It didn't take a lot of my time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't have large lecture courses?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: No. I lectured to a class that was studying African agriculture and
                    food scarcity problems. I drew on my experiences for that lecture and, in part,
                    for two lectures I gave to another class, which was looking at Africa in
                    general. But I spent the bulk of my time at UCLA doing research and writing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: I also trained for a marathon and ran in the 1983 SaFrancisco
                    marathon, which was-</p>

                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I was 52.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 52? And you're running marathons?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. Why not? [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good for you!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: It was something that's not everybody's cup of tea, but it was one of
                    those things that, once you do it, gives you a feeling of accomplishment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: True.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: It turned out to be a lot of fun because I ran with my cousin, her
                    husband, and my daughter Julianne. I didn't run with them precisely, because I
                    was in better shape than they were and ran ahead of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Julie, Brian, and I had arrived at UCLA in March 1983. Part of the
                    enjoyment of being there was that Julianne and Susan both spent a good amount of
                    time with us. Our son John was in school in Texas. When he finished the eighth
                    grade while we were in Somalia, John had to go to boarding school. He chose the
                    Marine Military Academy in Harlingen, Texas, and he was now finishing his junior
                    year there. We were to leave UCLA in June 1984. I had a call from Bill De Pree,
                    who asked me to be his deputy in State's Office of Management Operations, which
                    was sort of a management think tank for the Under Secretary of Management,
                    Ambassador Ron Spiers, a career FSO. I held that job until 1986.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>By that time, I had become a known commodity again and had backing for an
                    ambassadorship by Ron Spiers, the African Bureau, and the undersecretary for
                    political affairs, Mike Armacost. I became the State Department's candidate for
                    an opening in Tanzania. Ron Spiers, as under secretary for management, went to
                    the White House to negotiate with the White House Personnel Office for filling
                    upcoming ambassadorial vacancies. The White House had a candidate for Tanzania,
                    a state Senator from Ohio, but evidently he didn't have much clout because Ron
                    Spiers was able to prevail. Perhaps White House bought the argument that I had
                    served in Tanzania before, I spoke Swahili, I had been an ambassador, and I had
                    extensive service in Africa.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: [Laughter] Well, you never know. Luckily for me, hdidn't have high-
                    powered political backing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The state Senator from Ohio?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. I presented my credentials to the president of Tanzania, Ali
                    Hassan Mwinyi, in December 1986. Julius Nyerere, who had been the president of
                    that country for many years, had stepped down voluntarily when his term of
                    office was over, and Mwinyi had been elected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Am I mistaken, or is Ali Hassan Mwinyi Zanzibari?</hi>
                </p>

                    civil servant in the ministry of education. I knew him, although not as well as
                    I knew some other Zanzibaris. When I-</p>

                <p>PETTERSON: I suppose it did. And it didn't hurt that I was thfirst American

                <p>When I said, “Mwinyi was elected,” it was an in open, honest election. But there
                    was only one party. Tanzania was still living the fiction that a one-party state
                    could be democratic. This is what Nyerere believed, but he was wrong. Not only
                    was it undemocratic, it led to a great deal of corruption, as the party ossified
                    over the years. Nyerere's economic vision for Tanzania included a heavy dose of
                    state controls, which inevitably had led to an economic decline. The country was
                    an economic basket case by the time I got there. It was beginning to climb out
                    of the deep pit it had fallen into by late 1986, but it had a long way to
                    go.</p>
                <p>That year the United States and some other Western countries, the World Bank, and
                    the IMF (International Monetary Fund) were urging the Tanzanians to change from
                    the state run economy to a free-market oriented system. A lot of work that I did
                    in Tanzania centered on assisting the government to make that change. We also
                    helped facilitate American investment. In addition, I spent considerable time on
                    our economic and humanitarian AID programs. One project involved providing
                    locomotives, made by General Motors, to help in the rehabilitation of the TanZam
                    Railroad.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which had been built by the Chinese.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. This was somewhat ironic because in the 1960s the United States
                    had refused to build the railroad and then strongly opposed the Tanzanian
                    decision to accept the Chinese offer to do the job. So there I was meeting with
                    the Chinese and the Tanzanians, toasting each other, and hoping to get that
                    railroad back on track. Pardon the pun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Julie, Brian, and I traveled up-country whenever we could. Our
                    daughter Susan had finished college while we were in Tanzania, and she came out
                    and lived with us for our last year there. Tanzania's game areas were some of
                    the most spectacular in the world. We visited as many of them as we could in the
                    three years we were there. It was sad to see how much they had deteriorated -
                    that is, the infrastructure, the roads leading to them, the lodges at them, and
                    so forth. But they still were well worth seeing, and we didn't mind the
                    sometimes-rudimentary accommodations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some of the resort lodges were terrific.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: They had been, but they had fallen into disrepair. Yohad to bring your
                    own light bulbs, your own toilet paper.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really? How come?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: The country was economically ruined and was strapped for foreign
                    exchange. Imported items, and that meant things like light bulbs, were hard to
                    find and very expensive. The lodges had been taken over by the Tanzanian
                    government, which devoted next to no resources to their upkeep. In their current
                    rundown condition, the lodges did not attract tourists, and tourism had gone way
                    down in Tanzania.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. People preferred to go to Kenya, where there wergood lodges and
                    no shortage of amenities, as there was in Tanzania.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this is a big change from when you were in
                        Zanzibar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. We also traveled for other reasons, besides going to the game
                    areas. For example, the first trip that Julie, Brian, and I made was to Bukoba.
                    We drove to Mwanza and took a night steamer across Lake Victoria to Bukoba,
                    which was ravaged by AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) even then. It
                    got much worse later on. We went there to see the coffee production, to meet
                    with American citizens, missionaries who lived in the area. We did this sort of
                    travel to other parts of Tanzania too, during our tour. Julie and I became good
                    friends of Jane Goodall, who lived near us in Dar es Salaam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Julie organized some events to raise money for Jane's work. One
                    highlight of our time in Tanzania was a trip to visit Jane at Gombe Stream on
                    Lake Tanganyika, the site where he did her work with the chimpanzees. We stayed
                    in tents in her camp on the shore of Lake Tanganyika, a place of striking
                    beauty. On the second day we were there, Julie, Brian, and I had the great good
                    fortune to be with Jane when we encountered in a forest clearing some of the
                    chimps she had been working with for years. It was incredible to watch them
                    interact with her, a wonderful experience for the three of us.</p>
                <p>Julie and I traveled to Zanzibar as often as we could. It was and,and remains,
                    her favorite place in the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really? [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. [Laughter] It was our first assignment in Africa, two of our
                    children were born while we were there, and we had an adventure and many good
                    times. It wasn't just the memories. It was the Zanzibaris themselves. It was the
                    setting. Everything about Zanzibar made it her favorite place.</p>
                <p>With the end of my tour of duty, at the end of 1989, once again found myself with
                    no onward assignment.</p>
                <p>Q: Before you quite get to there, I'd like to ask you, you were in Tanzania for
                    three years when the country had been going down quite badly economically.</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, it had reached its lowest point just before we gothere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The “Ujamaa” (program of rural development that involved
                        thcreation of cooperative farm villages) movement was over.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. It had failed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you and the United States government doing to
                        try twork with Tanzania during the time you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: We, as you would expect, endeavored to get the Tanzanians to agree
                    with us on international issues. I remember talking with Foreign Minister Ben
                    Mkapa a lot about southern Africa. At that time the new prime minister of South
                    Africa was F. W. de Klerk. I knew him from my South African days, and I knew
                    that he was, in South African terms, a “verligte” or moderate Afrikaner, instead
                    of a “verkramte,” a conservative hard-liner on apartheid. I believed he was
                    sincere in what he was doing to eliminate apartheid. Mkapa was skeptical, but I
                    was right, as history has shown. But you have to remember that the Tanzanians
                    were distinctly suspicious of South Africa, which, after all, had mounted
                    intelligence operations within Tanzania. They had assassinated...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Eduardo Mondlane.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: ...Eduardo Mondlane in Dar es Salaam. So the Tanzanians had no reason
                    to trust the white South Africans. But change was taking place in South Africa,
                    and De Klerk was playing a very important role in that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. So now you've been lucky enough to be ambassador
                        twice,and you're still in the game here sir!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, and I was still learning the business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I think it's a mistake to train Foreign Service officers, raise them
                    to leadership positions, make them ambassadors, get them into policy
                    formulation, and then not continue to move them up, or at least sideways,
                    instead of sidelining them, which happens so often.</p>
                <p>At the end of my tour of my duty in 1989, I once again found that I had no onward
                    assignment. Once again, I had no friends in high places. When I got back to
                    Washington and surveyed the dismal dregs of jobs that were available then, I
                    decided that I might as well retire. I took the Department's retirement course,
                    which turned out to be very good. Those who gave the course did a fine job of
                    teaching Foreign Service personnel who were retiring how to find a job. The
                    course was highly lauded by private sector industry representatives who knew
                    about it. In addition, the Department gave those who did retire assistance in
                    finding jobs by letting them use facilities to send their resumes out, do
                    research on jobs, and so forth. It was very beneficial program.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, I took that course myself in 1980. It was being conducted by a retired
                    Foreign Service officer who had been in Personnel, Art somebody. It helped me a
                    great deal.</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: While I was in the course, the new assistant secretary of the African
                    Bureau, Hank Cohen, asked me to become a DAS temporarily, until a political
                    appointee could be brought on board. I agreed. While I in that job, Liberia
                    exploded and an interagency task force was formed to handle such problems as the
                    evacuation of hundreds of American citizens. The American military went to
                    Liberia to protect our embassy and to help out in the evacuation. In July of
                    that year, 1990, the head of the task force, deputy assistant secretary Jim
                    Bishop, left to become ambassador to Somalia, and I took his place. With crisis
                    following crisis in Liberia that summer, I could spend little time at home. The
                    task force job turned out to be long hours, seven days a week, but it was
                    certainly fascinating.</p>
                <p>In October I was sent to West Africa to try to arrange for a cease-fire in
                    Liberia. I traveled to Guinea, Sierra Leone, Gambia, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast,
                    and Liberia. I met with heads of state, trying to get their support for a
                    cease-fire. I went into northern Liberia where I met with Charles Taylor, who
                    was the leader of the rebel forces, and turned out to be a thoroughly,
                    disagreeable person, as I would find again eight years later.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Taylor and the other warlords who had emerged during the long civil
                    war in Liberia were interested only in power and not in the slightest in the
                    well being of the people. They engaged in very brutal acts of war, killed many,
                    many civilians. The cease-fire did not occur, even though I got the backing of
                    President Houphou�t-Boigny of Ivory Coast, who called a meeting of the regional
                    heads of states, which, in the event, didn't take place.</p>
                <p>When I returned to Washington, Hank Cohen asked me if I would go to Zimbabwe. The
                    American ambassador in Harare, a political appointee, had had to leave there
                    abruptly. Because of the nature of his personal problem...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter] We'll have to go into this a little bit
                        more.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I really can't-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Wasn't Carlos Baker, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: No. This man's name was, of all things, Rhodes. He was an African-
                    American lawyer from California who, because of the nature of his personal
                    difficulty, was recalled by the State Department and had to go back to private
                    life.</p>
                <p>The embassy had gotten used to this flamboyant character, and suddenly he left,
                    and nobody was told why, which left some perplexed and others irate. The DCM,
                    who took over, did not have good leadership qualities. Embassy morale was very
                    low. The president of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, believed that the ambassador had
                    been removed because he was too well disposed toward the Zimbabwean government.
                    I was asked to go to Harare to restore morale in the embassy and do what I could
                    to repair the relationship with Mugabe. The assignment was for an unspecified
                    time but, I was told, could be as long as a year, until the Foreign Service
                    officer who was in the pipeline to become ambassador could complete the
                    nomination and confirmation process and get out there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Julie go with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Oh, yes. She and Brian went with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. So this is Zimbabwe in 1990-</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: November 1990, and we stayed there until the late summeof '91.</p>
                <p>Q: Ninety-one. Well, there's two aspects to this. One is the internal aspect of
                    getting the embassy back on an even keel, and the other one is establishing a
                    more correct relationship with Mugabe?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. It turned out to be easy to achieve both objectives. First, all
                    that the embassy needed was an experienced officer to give them leadership,
                    which I was able to do. I made it a point to meet everyone individually. And I
                    brought them together as a group to tell them as much as I could, without
                    revealing the exact circumstances, about why the ambassador had left. This
                    seemed to work. I formed a close association with the AID director and worked
                    very cooperatively with him on the large AID program, doing what I could to
                    avoid the kind of “we, they” situation that sometimes exists between AID
                    missions and the embassy. I just did the things that anybody with common sense
                    would do. I believed it important to show people that you appreciate what
                    they're doing and that you care about their welfare. Anyway, morale, by all
                    accounts I was told, improved, and-</p>
                <p>Q: Don, it's kind of a funny situation because you don't think of Zimbabwe as a
                    place for a political appointee, particularly. In the second place, normally
                    when you send out a political appointee to a fairly small, remote country, you
                    usually also have there a DCM who really is a strong officer.</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I can't account for what happened. Incidentally, Zimbabwe was a plum
                    assignment. Most FSO Africanists would give their right arm to be ambassador to
                    Zimbabwe. Or at least they would have in the days before the current mess got so
                    bad. Harare has one of the most delightful climates in the world. It is a modern
                    city with good infrastructure and all the things that make up good city life. It
                    was an African post that was attractive to political appointees, and in 1991,
                    three of the four American ambassadors to Zimbabwe since it became independent
                    in 1980 had been political appointees.</p>
                <p>I met with Mugabe and gave him a letter from President Bush, explained as much as
                    I could about what had happened, and assured him that the ambassador's departure
                    had no political motivation.</p>
                <p>Q: Or U.S. relations with Zimbabwe?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, and he accepted that. Coincidentally, at about this time, the
                    Gulf crisis was in full flower and the war was soon to start. Mugabe was one
                    Africa leader who agreed with us enthusiastically, without reservation, that
                    something had to be done to stop Saddam Hussein. In a meeting I had with Mugabe,
                    he commented to me that Saddam was, in his view, insane.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>So, things were going well, and it was a pleasant assignment. Before the nine
                    months or so that we were in Zimbabwe ended, I had a phone call for deputy
                    assistant secretary Jeff Davidow of the African Bureau. He asked me if I would
                    like to have my name placed on the list of candidates for ambassador to
                    Sudan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, before we get to that-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes?</p>
                <p>Q: I'd like to ask you a question. Zimbabwe now, what, 10 years later, is going
                    through some extremely difficult times. Mugabe, for reasons that you're going to
                    explain to us, has allowed this movement of, sort of, African veterans taking
                    over the white farms. There's a great deal of tension and strain.</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did all that happen? Is this Mugabe clinging to
                        power?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. There was a lot of hope for Zimbabwe. Many whites had stayed on.
                    They were a distinct minority in the country, but they had a lot of economic
                    power, and some of them were in the political system. Zimbabwe's multiraciality
                    was far from perfect, but in many ways it was working. There were, though,
                    underlying tensions. One problem was that there was rapidly growing African
                    population, comprised mainly of subsistence farmers, and not enough good land to
                    go around. The best farms in the country were in the hands of whites, who had
                    created them and made them into the most productive farms perhaps in all of
                    Africa, certainly in most of Africa. With growing pressures for land
                    redistribution, while I was there the some people in the parliament and in the
                    government began agitating for expropriating whites' farms, taking them away
                    without providing adequate, if any, compensation. At that time, though, Mugabe
                    didn't want to move too fast because he knew that this would have a devastating
                    effect on the economy. So the call for seizing the lands was not heeded at that
                    time, but the beginning of a growing movement for that was definitely underway.
                    Mugabe now has given in to the extremists of this effort, has allowed the
                    veterans, so-called, to seize farms, has allowed white farmers to be murdered,
                    and not punished the murderers. Why? He wants to stay in power. His grip on
                    power has been weakened by corruption in the government, by his dictatorial
                    ways, by the growing poverty arising in part from his disastrous economic
                    policies, and by the desire of many Zimbabweans for a true democracy and
                    consequent growth of a strong political opposition to him. He's using demagogic
                    tactics land strong-arm measures to stay in power, pure and simple. It's a
                    shame.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, thank you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>So now we're at the end of 1991?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. I had this offer to go to Sudan. Julie and I talked it over.
                    Khartoum was not a place that one would call an ideal assignment. I remember I
                    went to Khartoum on a trip in 1977 with Andy Young. After a day or so there, I
                    said, to myself, “This is one place I would not like to serve in!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's also a place where a previous American ambassador had
                        beeassassinated!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: In 1973 Cleo Noel, our ambassador, and George Curtis Moore, the DCM,
                    and Guy Eid, a Belgian diplomat, were assassinated. They were seized by
                    terrorists at a party given by the Saudi ambassador, and, the next day, they
                    were murdered. In 1985 one of the embassy's American employees was shot by a
                    terrorist and severely wounded. Also in the '80s, a British couple and their
                    children were killed in a terrorist bombing in a Khartoum hotel where foreigners
                    congregated.</p>
                <p>Living conditions in Khartoum were far from ideal. It was a hot, dusty place and
                    lacked many amenities. But this didn't really bother us because we'd lived in
                    tough places before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying that Julie and you-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: We weighed the pros and cons of the assignment. We weren't ready to
                    leave the Service, and we were hoping to go back to Africa. Sudan had a
                    fascinating history. Khartoum, situated at the confluence of the Blue and White
                    Nile rivers, was rich in history and culturally extremely interesting. So we
                    decided we wanted to go, but we wouldn't accept the offer unless there was a
                    good school for our son Brian, who by this time was twelve years old. Well, we
                    learned that there was an international school there, called the American
                    School, although there weren't many American kids attending it. I called Jeff
                    and said, “Sure, put my name in the hopper.” Strangely enough, there were no
                    White House candidates [laughter] for the job.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not surprised.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: My name went forward, and the slow process of getting nominated and
                    confirmed began. We were back in Washington from Zimbabwe by the fall of 1991. I
                    took an FSI area studies course on the Middle East, had meetings in the
                    Department on Sudan, delved into Sudan's history and culture, and began to study
                    Arabic. I had a reasonably good aptitude for languages and had learned to speak
                    Swahili and Spanish with some fluency. But Arabic is a very difficult language
                    to learn, and the several months that I was able to study it were not nearly
                    enough to give me a good working knowledge of it. But at least I gained some
                    familiarity with Arabic, which was somewhat useful to me when I got to
                    Khartoum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is while you're in the nomination process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, I'm waiting. The wait came to an end in the summer of 1992. After
                    I was sworn in, Julie, Brian and I flew to Khartoum. This was not a happy land
                    we were coming to. The country was riven by a civil war that had started in
                    1956, ended in 1972, resumed in 1983, and was still being waged. In the nineteen
                    years since 1983, almost two million people had died as a result of the
                    conflict.</p>
                <p>Q: Before you get into talking about U.S.-Sudanese relations, as opposed to the
                    embassies in Tanzania and Zimbabwe, what was the American embassy in Khartoum
                    like? How big? What kinds of things going on? What were your marching orders
                    from Washington?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Before I get into that, let me give some more background on the
                    situation in Sudan. Since becoming independent, Sudan had fluctuated between
                    democratically elected governments and dictatorships. The military seized power
                    in 1958, civilian government was restored in 1965, a military dictatorship under
                    General Gaafar al-Nimeiri was in control from 1969 until 1985. In 1986, after
                    democratic elections, a new civilian government took office. It was overthrown
                    in 1989. Political instability arose from the fact that Sudan's largest
                    political parties were religiously based, and none was able to win a majority of
                    votes, so coalition governments were formed. The coalitions spent much of their
                    energy trying to survive politically and were unable to deal effectively with
                    Sudan's major national economic and social problems. Added to this weakness of
                    the political system, the war in southern Sudan was a constant drain on the
                    resources of the country and a factor of political disunity.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>All the governments of Sudan, military as well as civilian, had had an Islamic
                    flavor. From the outset of independence, the two largest political parties
                    advocated a central role for Islam in Sudan's governing process. They favored
                    eventual establishment of an Islamic republic with the sharia, or Islamic law,
                    as the basis of legislation. But it took a military dictator, Nimeiri, to
                    actually impose the sharia as state law, as he did in September 1983. Later,
                    when heading the coalition government that began ruling in 1986, Prime Minister
                    Sadiq al-Mahdi did not believe that he had an option to overturn the sharia
                    laws. However, Sadiq promised to introduce new, less stringent, Islamic laws or
                    revise them in a manner to protect Sudan's non-Muslim minority. His government
                    was overthrown before any changes were instituted.</p>
                <p>The National Islamic Front, an Islamist political party, was formed in 1985. It
                    was headed by Sadiq al-Mahdi's brother-in-law and political opponent, Hassan
                    al-Turabi, an Islamic scholar and consummate politician. Turabi and his NIF
                    opposed the negotiating path that the Sadiq government was finally taking to end
                    the war. Working together, the NIF and Islamist military officers led by
                    Brigadier General Omar al-Bashir overthrew the government in June 1989. Since
                    then, the Islamists have done everything necessary to remain in power.</p>
                <p>The Bashir government wasted no time in moving against possible opponents.
                    Hundreds of people were detained and many were tortured. In early 1990
                    twenty-eight army officers were summarily executed. A purge of the civil
                    service, military, police, and judiciary was carried out. Over the years, the
                    Bashir government systematically did away with democratic institutions and civil
                    rights.</p>
                <p>As prescribed by U.S. law, in 1989 Washington suspended all but humanitarian aid
                    to Sudan because a democratically elected government had been forcibly
                    overthrown. The U.S. condemned the summary execution of the military officers.
                    It deplored the detentions of hundreds of people and other gross violations of
                    human rights. Sudan's harboring of international terrorists was another bone of
                    contention. . Sudan had become a haven for Islamic terrorist organizations. In
                    1991, the United States warned the Sudanese that there would be consequences if
                    they did not stop abetting terrorism. The Sudanese said our accusations were
                    baseless. To add to the problem in the relationship, Sudan had supported Iraq
                    during the Gulf War.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>In 1992, when I arrived, the continued detention of political prisoners and their
                    mistreatment, including torture, and other gross violations of human right
                    remained as obstacles to any improvement in U.S.-Sudanese relations. The
                    prosecution of the war in southern Sudan and the excessive use of force against
                    civilians in the course of that war were another serious problem. So too was the
                    Sudanese government's interference with the delivery of humanitarian aid to some
                    places in southern Sudan. Another issue that accounted for the differences that
                    the United States had with Sudan was the Sudanese government's treatment of tens
                    of thousands of southern Sudanese who had come from the south to Khartoum and
                    were living in the city. They were forcibly removed to outlying areas that were
                    barren and lacking basic facilities. There was no water, inadequate shelter, and
                    so forth. These people became totally dependent on international assistance to
                    stay alive.</p>
                <p>So we had a number of quarrels about the Sudanese.</p>
                <p>When people found out I was going to be ambassador to Sudan, thedidn't know
                    whether to congratulate me [laughter] or to console me.</p>
                <p>The Sudanese government regarded my arrival in Sudan in the summer of 1992 as an
                    opening for improved relations. In the months and years ahead I would find that
                    the Bashir government tended to misread certain eventlike my arrival, or a visit
                    by an official from Washington, or the election of a new U.S. presidento misread
                    these as signs that relations between Sudan and the United States were on the
                    verge of an upswing. On such occasions, I made it a point to caution Bashir,
                    Turabi and others that although Washington did want better relations with Sudan,
                    unless Sudan began to take steps to meet U.S. concerns, relations would not
                    improve.</p>
                <p>When I presented my credentials to Bashir, after an exchange of formal remarks,
                    we sat down and had a frank talk. In it, I told him that relations were poor and
                    would not get any better unless his government improved its human rights record,
                    eased restrictions on the delivery of humanitarian aid, and stopped harboring
                    terrorists. Bashir pretty much dismissed those concerns as baseless but
                    indicated that he believed relations could be improved.</p>
                <p>The chief of protocol was ecstatic afterwards, saying to me that Bashir had not
                    before given so much time to talk to a new ambassador at a credentials
                    presentation ceremony. I told Washington that this was well and good but that
                    the talk with Bashir had broken no new ground. I said it indicated that the
                    Sudanese government did not understand the depth of our differences and that
                    they were not prepared to do anything to meet our concerns.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>I made my rounds, meeting with Sudanese leaders and others, spreading the gospel,
                    so to speak, of what was needed if relations were to improve. I said that Sudan
                    had to stop providing refuge and support to terrorists, it had to move toward a
                    restoration of democracy, it had to improve its abysmal human rights record, it
                    had to stop impeding the flow of humanitarian aid to those who needed it, and it
                    had to make a good faith effort to end the war. Despite a real desire on the
                    part of at least some of the government's leaders for closer ties with
                    Washington, they were not willing to admit to any faults, much less change their
                    policies and practices. To do so, they must have believed, would be to
                    jeopardize their hold on political power.</p>
                <p>Still, at that time perhaps we could have made some progress in bettering
                    relations had there not been an incident that made things even worse.</p>
                <p>Shortly before I arrived in Sudan, Sudanese security forces in Juba, a large city
                    in the far south of the country, entered the USAID compound there and detained
                    the thirteen Africans who were working there. AID had ended its operations in
                    the South, but it had kept the compound open under the care of these thirteen
                    employees to symbolize to the southern Sudanese that we cared about them and to
                    indicate that we hoped to come back. At least that seemed to be the rational. I
                    never saw it in writing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it doing anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: No.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: No. The employees were simply acting as caretakers. The regular radio
                    transmissions from the Juba compound to Khartoum had stopped. Our AID director,
                    Carol Becker, told me that she was deeply concerned. I took the matter up with,
                    first, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, asking them to look into it. Nothing
                    came of this. I went to see Nafi Ali Nafi. Nafi, who had a Ph.D. in botany from
                    the University of California at Riverside, was a top official in the
                    government's security apparatus and a member of the Bashir-Turabi inner circle.
                    He said that Andrew Tombe, the senior employee at the USAID compound, had been
                    conspiring with the rebels and was going to be tried for treason. Worried about
                    that, I went to other officials. I talked to a man named Ghazi Salaheddine
                    Atabani, who was a junior minister and very influential. A few days after we
                    met, Ghazi told me that the employees were unharmed. Actually, as I would find
                    out later, Andrew Tombe and three others were already dead, having been
                    executed. We didn't know this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Ghazi know it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: I don't know. After I left had Ghazi's office, I wrote a letter to the
                    president saying I was very concerned that about Tombe and asking Bashir to
                    exercise leniency if Tombe had been tried.</p>
                <p>On September 18, Julie, Brian, and I were at the embassy commissary helping
                    others to clean up after a fire there, when I was told I should go to the
                    embassy. Once there, I learned that Bashir had responded to my letter orally
                    through an army officer. Bashir's message was that it had been too late for him
                    to do anything, for the sentence had already been carried out. Tombe had been
                    executed. A few days later, we learned that another USAID employee had been
                    executed. Much later, we deduced that two others had also been executed. None of
                    this came directly from the government. And of course we were never notified
                    that all thirteen men in the compound had been detained and tortured. All this
                    came to light when, in late October, I went to Juba. It took me that long to get
                    there because the government kept delaying permission for a trip to Juba in a UN
                    aircraft, the only way I could get there. Finally, after I threatened to close
                    the embassy's consular section, the necessary permission was granted.</p>
                <p>The charge that Tombe was using the USAID radio to communicate with the rebels
                    was utter nonsense. Tombe knew that the radio was being monitored. In fact,
                    sometimes when he made a radio broadcast, he had security people with him. It
                    would have been suicidal for him to have used the radio to talk to rebels.
                    Confronting the head security officer in Juba, I said I did not believe the
                    charges against Tombe. In response, he made the incredible assertion that Tombe
                    had gone to a market with the radio and, accompanied by a UN African employee
                    (who also was executed), began broadcasting, in full view of people there. This
                    was so ludicrous that it just underlined the falsity of all the charges.</p>
                <p>When the AID employees in Juba had been detained, the Sudan People's Liberation
                    Army, the main rebel force, had advanced close to the town. Suspecting that
                    townspeople were in league with the SPLA, the security forces there embarked on
                    a campaign of terror. There were widespread arrests, and many people were
                    murdered, as was testified to by priests and other witnesses who were in Juba at
                    the time. What happened to the USAID employees was a part of the hysteria of the
                    security forces.</p>
                <p>Washington was outraged. The State Department issued a statement condemning the
                    execution of Tombe (the only one we knew of at that time) and noting that there
                    had been credible reports of widespread killing of civilians in Juba by
                    government security forces. Khartoum made an angry response. Relations, already
                    sour, got much worse.</p>
                <p>So, this was our introduction to Sudan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wow! How many people were there in the embassy? What
                        agenciewere represented?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: Well before the Bashir government came to power, the U.S. mission in
                    Sudan was one of our largest in Africa. For a time, beginning in 1982, Sudan was
                    the largest recipient of U.S. economic and military aid in all of sub-Saharan
                    Africa. We had a military assistance group, a huge AID program, a large embassy
                    staff, a USIS office, agriculture attach� office, and, of course, CIA station.
                    All this changed, especially after the suspension of economic and military
                    assistance in 1982. By the time I arrived in 1992, the total number of U.S.
                    mission employees had been reduced to 53.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That still is substantial!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, but the number would diminish even more. In 1992, the embassy had
                    a political section, economic section, administrative staff, security office,
                    USIS office, and CIA station. For the first time in my career, I had a full-time
                    security detail. Whenever I traveled anywhere, to work, around town, or out of
                    town, I was accompanied by armed security people. The bulk of these were
                    Sudanese ex-policemen who were armed with automatic weapons. I had an armored
                    van, and an American security officer traveled in the car with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure Julie loved this!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Both of us had to get used to it, and of course one can get accustomed
                    to just about anything. I really didn't like it, and thought about asking
                    Washington to do away with the security detail. They would not have agreed, of
                    course. I remember once telling a Sudanese friend that I would prefer not to
                    have the detail. He replied, “Look, this place being what it is, that would be
                    madness!”</p>
                <p>I kicked over the traces twice. We had brought a Honda Accord with us. It sat,
                    unused, inside the wall of the residence. Twice, on weekends, when my security
                    people were off...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No security on the weekends! [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: They didn't stay at the residence when I had no travel plans. Of
                    course, there was plenty of security at the house, not only our security guards,
                    but also Sudanese police - the British embassy was just down the street from our
                    residence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, okay. So you zoomed out of residence in your car and
                        went jogging.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I said, “Open the gate. I'm going-” [Laughter]</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>No, I didn't go jogging. I just drove the car around town for a few minutes, came
                    back, parked the car, didn't tell anybody. The second time I did that, the
                    security guys heard about it, and they said, “Mr. Ambassador, please.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: It was unfair to them, I know, and I didn't do it again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I ran fairly often and played tennis occasionally. In Khartoum, you
                    ran early in the morning because it would be too hot otherwise. I remember
                    running some afternoons when, even late in the day, the temperature was well
                    over 100 degrees. I had joined with a group of serious runners, who did a six or
                    seven mile run at a location outside Khartoum. In trying to keep up with them in
                    that heat, I found that it was no fun at all - my pulse rate went up much too
                    high - and I gave that up. What was fun, though, was participating once again
                    with Hash House Harriers. We ran once a week. Whenever I hosted the after-run
                    festivities, the attendance was very good. The government banned the use of
                    alcoholic beverages, but diplomats could serve them on diplomatic property. So,
                    I had beer for the hashers, most of whom did not have diplomatic privileges, and
                    they were very appreciative.</p>
                <p>But, again, except for the Hash runs, I generally did my running ithe early
                    morning, when it was cooler.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A balmy 85!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I would go out with a car in front and a car behind and run for 45
                    minutes, an hour, hour and a half, sometimes, on a weekend, longer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anybody else in the embassy go with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: When I arrived in Khartoum, my security bodyguards were Delta Force
                    members. These guys were really fit, and they ran with me. They were so tough. I
                    remember running down Nile Road one morning. It was early, as usual, and the
                    traffic was light. But a car coming toward us looked as if it would pass
                    somewhat close. The Delta Force guy who was running alongside me ran directly at
                    that car [laughter], by his action saying, “Get out of the way!” It veered off.
                    The State Department security officers who succeeded them as my bodyguards were
                    not nearly as fit. Some of them ran once or twice and gave it up. But others did
                    well. One was a marathoner, and he delighted in going out with me. The marines
                    would come over sometimes in the morning, and occasionally someone else who was
                    into running joined me. My running was, of course, was well known to the
                    Sudanese security and to the Sudanese government. Hassan al-Turabi used to make
                    fun of me. “If Sudan is such a place of terrorism and danger and you have to
                    have all those security guards, why are you out running around in the
                    morning?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You could say, “Well, you'll notice that I have cars in
                        front anbehind me.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Aside from the heavy security, our personal life in Khartoum was
                    similar to our life at other African posts. We had friends from among the
                    Americans, the diplomatic community, and the local community. But many Sudanese
                    felt they could not come to our house. They were fearful of what the government
                    might do to them. Our next door neighbors, for example, never came to see us. I
                    made it a point of regularly inviting to dinner NGO representatives, with whom
                    we worked on the humanitarian assistance program..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a USIS operation there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: We did at the beginning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes you can get people to come for dinner and a
                        film.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Sure, and we did this. There were times, especially later in my
                    assignment, when Americans could with justification feel a bit beleaguered in
                    Khartoum, as relations with the government spiraled further downward. But we had
                    an active social life and were enjoying our existence there.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>In early 1993, I began travels to the south. Outside of a few ambassadors who had
                    gone to Juba under government auspices, I was the first ambassador since the
                    Bashir government came to power to travel into southern Sudan. I don't know why
                    others hadn't done this, but I regarded the entire country as my parish, so to
                    speak. I was ambassador to all of Sudan, south as well as north. I went to the
                    foreign ministry and said that I was going on such and such a date. They told
                    me, “We will get back to you.”</p>
                <p>But they did not, so off I went. I flew to Nairobi. From Nairobi I went by UN
                    aircraft to Lokichokkio, which is in the area where the extreme tip of
                    northwestern Kenya juts into southeastern Sudan. The base camp of the
                    international humanitarian relief program for southern Sudan is located at
                    Lokichokkio. From there I would fly into the south of-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To Juba?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Not to Juba, no. I had already gone to Juba from the north. In all I
                    made about ten trips into southern Sudan displaced persons camps and many towns
                    and villages in Eastern Equatoria, Western Equatoria, Upper Nile, and Bahr
                    el-Ghazal over the course of the next two and a half years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these by yourself, or did you take NGO people with
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I often flew with somebody from the United Nations. I had become very
                    closely professionally associated with Phillip O'Brien, an Irishman who headed
                    UNICEF's office in Nairobi and also the Operation Lifeline Sudan humanitarian
                    assistance program. Someone from our AID mission in Nairobi who had
                    responsibility for southern Africa would frequently go with me. Sometimes an
                    official of the humanitarian relief organization of the rebel movement
                    accompanied us, because we were going into their territory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The foreign ministry never really gave you a hard time
                        about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: On occasion, after I got back to Khartoum. But, as much as they were
                    unhappy about my trips into the south, they didn't try to prevent me from
                    going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were going into rebel held areas?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes, but not exclusively. At times we tried to give balance to the
                    trips by going to government-held areas too. I made the trips into southern
                    Sudan to see what the situation was in the areas were displaced people were
                    congregated, to see what their needs were, to see what could be done to improve
                    the flow of relief supplies. In the bush, NGO and UN personnel would take us
                    around, and we would stay with them at their camps. I was always impressed by
                    the selflessness of relief workers, most of whom worked in very difficult
                    conditions. In either Nairobi or when I got back to Khartoum, I reported to
                    Washington on what I had observed and heard regarding the relief situation and
                    the war. We got very close to the war zone on more than one occasion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: To fly we needed to have clearance from the authorities, both the
                    southern Sudanese and the northern Sudanese, which we managed to get. If there
                    were fighting in an area or it was getting close, the UN security officer in
                    Lokichokkio might say, “We can't chance it.” Once or twice, after we got into
                    the south, a trip to a specific location was scrubbed.</p>
                <p>We generally flew in Twin Otters or one or another variety of Cessna, often a
                    Cessna Caravan. The Otters had a pilot and co-pilot, but the other aircraft had
                    only one pilot. In those, I would usually sit up in the cockpit with the pilot.
                    It was more fun to do it that way, and occasionally the pilot would let me take
                    the controls, much to the excitement of the passengers in back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I remember talking to the pilots one day during a trip.I asked, “How
                    high do we have to be to not be hit by a missile?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To be out of range! [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. Both sides had hand-held Stinger missiles. And he said, “Well,
                    12,000 feet should be okay.” So, seeing that the altimeter read 12,000 feet, I
                    was reassured. [Laughter]Q: [Laughter]</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: When we would get to a place where we were going and where at that
                    time enemy troops were close by, the pilot would very quickly spiral down and
                    land in a hurry on the airstrip.</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>What I saw at some of the places that I visited remains indelibly imprinted in my
                    mind. Extreme suffering, of the kind that I saw in Somalia, but even worse. Men,
                    women, and children starving, some of them dying right at our feet. I remember
                    once, when I was talking to a rebel commander in a clearing, we were ringed by
                    emaciated, desperate people. Several of them, carrying something, were edging
                    forward. As they got closer, I saw that their bundle was a body. They held it
                    up, in mute supplication, showing us how bad things were.</p>
                <p>When I started flying into the south, almost all of the fighting was taking place
                    between to two major rebel factions, not between the government forces and the
                    rebels. One faction, then called the Sudan People's Liberation Army/Mainstream,
                    was led by John Garang, a former Sudanese army officer who had been educated,
                    got a Ph.D., at Iowa State University. The other, the Sudan People's Liberation
                    Army/United, was headed by a former lieutenant of Garang, Riek Machar. The worst
                    effect of the fighting was that relief operations were interrupted, and
                    thousands of people were at risk of starvation. The death toll was high and
                    rising. After visiting the area in March and April, in May I met in Nairobi with
                    representatives of the two rebel factions and after a couple of days of
                    difficult negotiations, got them to agree to a cease-fire in the area that had
                    come to be called, “the starvation triangle.” Garang gave his okay, but I had to
                    go up-country to see Riek Machar to get his approval, which I did. The
                    cease-fire held only for a short time. It failed because there was no way to
                    enforce it through international monitoring. No government, nor the UN, would
                    provide the necessary monitors. But at least during the days that the cease-fire
                    held, relief operations went forward and some lives were saved. My reporting
                    cables after a trip sometimes pointed to the need for more food supplies or for
                    other needed improvements to the relief operations. Often, the number of
                    aircraft for delivering the supplies was inadequate. In one cable I sent
                    regarding the need to add to the airlift capability of the Operation Lifeline
                    Sudan, I put it in pretty stark terms. I said, “Either we get more transport, or
                    a lot of people will die.” By and large when I asked for something, I got it
                    because there was a great amount of sympathy for the suffering people of
                    southern Sudanese.</p>
                <p>When I would come out of the south and fly from Lokichokkio to Nairobi en route
                    to Khartoum, I frequently met with journalists and told them what I had
                    encountered during the trip. I did this to try to draw attention to the terrible
                    plight of the southern Sudanese. I had little success, for the media, certainly
                    the U.S. media, were not much interested in Sudan. But occasionally there was
                    some coverage. The BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) always did an
                    interview and broadcast it. This was good, in that it called some attention to
                    the southern Sudan issue, but it also got me in trouble with Khartoum. On at
                    least on two occasions when I got back, I was in hot water for having said
                    things that the Sudanese government did not like to hear.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: But when I met with government officials, described my trip, and
                    explained what I had actually said, which was not the same as the BBC reported
                    it, the Sudanese seemed mollified, and took no action against me, which some
                    were advocating. There were some front-page articles in newspapers saying that I
                    had committed unfriendly acts and should be thrown out of the country. But,
                    again, nothing came of all this.</p>
                <p>I don't want to give a picture that I was locked into acrimonious exchanges with
                    the Sudanese officials. Although I paint a picture of a ruthless government,
                    which it was, its members were typically Sudanese. The Sudanese are well known
                    to be among the warmest, nicest people in Africa. I had cordial relationships,
                    by and large, even with those with whom I had sometimes-sharp disagreements. On
                    a personal level, for example, I always got along well with Bashir.</p>
                <p>My relationship with Turabi was different. He was an intellectual who liked to
                    joust with anybody who came to see him, who liked to show how smart he was, who
                    held many, and I'm sure I was included among them, in contempt. Turabi was a
                    very interesting man. He was a lawyer and a world-renowned Islamic scholar. He
                    saw himself at the center of an Islamic revival that would make profound changes
                    throughout the Muslim world. Some believed that he was not the man he used to
                    be. In May 1992, just before I went to Sudan, he was on a tour of the United
                    Nations and Canada. While he was in Canada at an airport, a Sudanese attacked
                    him, beat him, and almost killed him. He had a severe head injury, and he was in
                    a coma for a while. People who saw him later saidthat he was mentally impaired.
                    Be that as it may, I found him to be formidable and quite incisive
                    generally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was he? Was he the foreign minister?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: No. He did not have a government position at this time. He was the
                    head of the National Islamic Front, the Islamist political party that he had
                    founded in 1985. Turabi was the power behind the throne, the architect of
                    Sudanese policy. He had many followers. His disciples were in key places in the
                    government and the security apparatus.</p>
                <p>My talks with Turabi brought out very clearly in the remarks he'd made - which I
                    transcribed (I took notes) and which I reported to Washington - how deep his
                    anti- Semitism was, how ignorant he was of the United States, although he
                    professed to know more about the United States than I did. He was a supremely
                    arrogant, fascinating, complex man whose aim was not only to control the
                    government and to spread Islam in Sudan, but also to be in the vanguard of an
                    Islamic movement that would sweep the world. Many believed that he aimed to
                    displace Bashir one day and become the head of government. But later on, in
                    1999, he overreached himself, alienated some his followers who had become high
                    officials in the government, and lost a struggle with Bashir, who turned out to
                    be tougher and more astute than many had given him credit for.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>In Khartoum, we in the embassy met with people from the government, with
                    southerners living in the city, with businessmen and professional people,
                    educators, clergymen, with people from many walks of life to keep abreast of
                    what was going on. I had an exceptionally capable political counselor, Lucien
                    Vandenbroudke. I was fortunate, too, to have a good DCM, Larry Benedict. In
                    fact, the staff of the American mission was composed by and large of highly able
                    people. Unfortunately, that staff would soon be cut way back.</p>
                <p>Julie, Brian, and I went on home leave in the summer of 1993. When we passed
                    through Washington on our way back to Khartoum, I was told by the State
                    Department that the U.S. government was on the verge of putting Sudan on the
                    American list of state sponsors of terrorism. The Secretary of State would
                    announce his decision imminently. I asked that this not be done until I got back
                    to Sudan. I thought it would be unfair to have my deputy take that message to
                    the government. I felt it was my job to do that and take the flak that would
                    ensue. The State Department agreed, and back to Khartoum we went. On August 15,
                    the cable with the message came in. The Sudanese got wind of what was about to
                    happen - ABC television news had the story - and I was not given an appointment
                    to see President Bashir. Instead, I delivered the message to Omar Berido, the
                    foreign ministry's first under secretary. Putting a country on the list of state
                    sponsors of terrorism invokes certain sanctions, but it meant little to Sudan
                    because American sanctions were already in force. So it really didn't make much
                    difference in terms of putting screws on Sudan, but it was psychologically and
                    politically damaging to the Sudanese, to their international reputation, if
                    nothing else. They reacted furiously. The government organized some
                    demonstrations, the first of which took place at the residence, the others at
                    the embassy. They were nothing to worry abouI was sure that the government
                    wouldn't let them get out of hand. But a problem arose when we received
                    intelligence information that the government was planning to engineer an
                    assassination of embassy people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good grief!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Washington reacted to this message in the belief that the CIA source
                    was legitimate. He had provided some good intelligence before. This latest
                    information was evaluated and found credible. The Department instructed me to
                    evacuate dependents and to reduce staff. Well, I wasn't so sure about the
                    validity of the information, but I had my marching orders. There was nothing I
                    could do. I broke the news to the embassy and, of course, to Julie and Brian.
                    Julie was very upset. She saw no reason for this. She didn't want to go, but, of
                    course, she had to. There was a lot of similar sentiment within the embassy. My
                    DCM, Larry Benedict, had the unenviable job of preparing for me a list of those
                    employees who would go. Once we agreed on the list, we let everybody know.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>We had to cut the staff from 52 to 38. Then, about a week later, we got new
                    information that indicated, if not immediate danger, at least a precarious
                    situation for embassy Americans in Khartoum. A decision was made to cut the
                    staff even further, down to less than 30.</p>
                <p>In a very orderly fashion, the evacuation took place. I sai“Goodbye” to Julie and
                    Brian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Evacuate to where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Back to the States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, not just Nairobi?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: No. Those officers and staff who went back to the U.S. waited for a
                    while to see whether they could return, but, as it turned out, none could. They
                    had to arrange for other assignments. Julie and Brian went to Oregon, where we
                    had decided we would retire, southern Oregon. But after a few months she was too
                    lonely and Brian was not happy in his school. So they went to Mexico to be with
                    her family.</p>
                <p>For a short time, we in the embassy kept a low profile. More demonstrations took
                    place. The government wildly exaggerated the number of people who were in
                    attendance. They even organized a demonstration of southerners against us and
                    dragooned some southerners into taking part in it. But only a small number of
                    people participated, most of them not southerners at all.</p>
                <p>Washington continued to worry about the safety of the Americans remaining in
                    Khartoum. The demonstrations, inflammatory government statements, and an intense
                    anti-American propaganda campaign finally elicited a harsh message from
                    Washington to the Sudanese government and to Turabi. The message said, in
                    effect, “Anything happens to Americans, we're going to hit you in a way that
                    will hurt!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wow!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. And I was asked to deliver this message, of course!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, lucky you! [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I called the Omar Berido at the foreign ministry. Hwanted to know what
                    the content of the message was.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>I said, “It's a message from President Clinton.”</p>
                <p>He accepted that. Their ambassador in Washington had been reamed out when he had
                    been called into the State Department and should have known that a message from
                    Washington to Khartoum would be quite negative. But he, fool that he was,
                    indicated that it would be something positive. So Bashir and Turabi were
                    expecting something perhaps saying, “It's time for us to begin to repair the
                    relationship.”</p>
                <p>But then I come in with this bombshell!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: They thought that I had duped them into receiving me, for they would
                    not have personally received this kind of a message. I hadn't (and later on,
                    they came to understand that I hadn't), but for a while my relationship with the
                    government was in a deep-freeze. I could not see Bashir. But, as always happened
                    during my time in Sudan, before long the Sudanese relented. Because they
                    continued to want a better relationship with the United States, my access was
                    restored, and we went on as before with the same frustratingly fruitless
                    discussions about what they needed to do to have a better relationship with the
                    United States. Because there was little I could accomplish in improving
                    relations, I focused on the humanitarian assistance program. As the ambassador
                    of one of the major donor countries, I took my turn chairing meetings of the
                    weekly donor-country ambassadors and UN agency heads. I held these at the
                    residence. As donor chairman, I accompanied the UN Coordinator to weekly
                    meetings with the Sudanese relief authorities. I also met with NGO
                    representatives fairly frequently. And I met separately with government
                    officials in efforts to get them to be more cooperative on the delivery of
                    assistance to the south and also to the hundreds of thousands of Sudanese who
                    were in these awful camps around-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Around Khartoum.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Khartoum. My efforts on behalf of the humanitarian aid program, and my
                    trips in to southern Sudan, became the most important factor of my work over the
                    time remaining in my assignment, which was had almost two years to go. Julie and
                    Brian, as it turned out, did not get back until just a couple months before we
                    left Sudan. I had, on a couple of occasions, recommended to Washington that they
                    lift the ban on dependents. In my view there was no great danger. As it was, a
                    year or so after the evacuation, Washington determined that the intelligence
                    report that had caused it was false. Nevertheless, once an evacuation has taken
                    place, the Department is very slow-</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: ...to permit dependents to return.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Twice when I recommended that the ban on dependents be lifted, my
                    senior staff disagreed with me. I sent their disagreement in to Washington along
                    with my recommendation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your staff thought that the dependents should not come
                        back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Right. I disagree with them. I saw no more danger in Khartoum than was
                    the case when I arrived there, when we had a full staff. There would always be
                    an element of risk serving in Khartoum, but no more so than in some other tight
                    spots in the world where we had full embassy staffs, and where dependents were
                    at post. Finally I prevailed, and a couple of months before my assignment was
                    up, Julie and Brian returned.I would have to say that of all my assignments,
                    this was probably the most difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not surprised.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: We'd experienced a violent revolution in Zanzibar and I had had some
                    difficult times in Nigeria and Sierra Leone. Dealing with apartheid in South
                    Africa was no picnic, either. But Sudan was the most difficult. It was next to
                    impossible to make any headway with a government that would not deviate from its
                    intention to maintain itself in power by any means necessary, including force.
                    In addition, it persisted in giving refuge to terrorist organizations. And its
                    gross violations of human rights continued with regularity.</p>
                <p>Q: Before we leave Sudan, I have to ask you one question, Don. After the attacks
                    on the embassies in Nairobi and Dar, I believe one of the steps we took was to
                    send a cruise missile to hit a factory?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Khartoum? From your service there, do you think
                        thaterrorist materials were being made there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: There was no hint of that while I was there. I left in 1995, the
                    cruise missile attack on the pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum took place in
                    '98. Subsequently, I was asked a number of times, for instance by radio talk
                    show hosts when I was promoting the book I wrote on Sudan, whether the American
                    cruise missile attack was justified. My answer was that I believed it was a
                    mistake. The administration failed to produce conclusive evidence that chemical
                    weapons were being made at the pharmaceutical factory. The administration had
                    grounds for suspicion, but to commit an act of war, which the missile attack
                    was, the evidence should have been iron clad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let me just say that on behalf of ADST (The
                        Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training), I want to thank you very
                        kindly for taking the time and coming up to my house in Woodstock to talk to
                        me about a really very, very interesting and demanding career.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>All right. Well, today is June 7, 2001. This is Stu Kennedy workinwith Don. We'll
                    continue this.</p>
                <p>When did you leave the Sudan?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I left there in the end of July 1995.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nineteen ninety-five. And you what, retired at that
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Retired at that point, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a retirement that you kind of looked forward to,
                        or weryou sort of keen to go out again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I would have jumped at an interesting assignment, but I was going to
                    reach the mandatory retirement age in November. If there had been an appropriate
                    assignment opening up well before then, that is an ambassadorship, I could have
                    been considered for it. At least that is what I was told. However, nothing was
                    coming up in the near term. There was no way that Dick Moose, the under
                    secretary for management, or anyone else could have kept me on the rolls after I
                    reached 65, waiting for some ambassadorial opening. Anyway, although I was not
                    ready to retire, I had no choice in the matter, and retire I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go when you retired?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: I went to New Hampshire, which was a foreign assignment for me. I had
                    grown up in California, had little knowledge of New Hampshire, and only some
                    brief stays there, visiting one of my daughters. When we were in Somalia two
                    older kids had to go to boarding school because there was no school beyond the
                    eighth grade in Mogadishu.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Susan went to a school in upstate New York. Julianne chose a small
                    school in Vermont. From there she went to the University of Vermont. She married
                    a New England boy. They settled first in Massachusetts, and then in New
                    Hampshire, not far from Exeter. My wife, Julie, our son, Brian, and I had
                    visited them a couple of times when we were on leave. When she and Brian were
                    evacuated from Sudan, they passed through that area again, and Julie grew more
                    comfortable with the idea of living there. Some years earlier, when we began
                    thinking about retirement, we had considered California, where I, in particular,
                    had wanted to live after leaving the Foreign Service. But we soon concluded that
                    we couldn't afford to buy a house in the places we liked, including my hometown
                    of San Luis Obispo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: To make a long story short, when Julie and Brian were on their way
                    back to Khartoum after the Department had decided to allow dependents to return,
                    they stopped in New Hampshire again. Julie found a house she liked very much in
                    Brentwood, which abuts Exeter, and almost put a contract on it. We bought it
                    after I retired.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes. This is an aside. In doing this oral history, I've found that we used to
                    have rather extensive colonies of retirees in the San Francisco and San Diego
                    area. Those have dried up because the government pension which used to go a long
                    way in those places, housing is just out of reach.</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. My daughter Susan has lived in San Francisco for about fifteen
                    years, and we know what housing costs are there. They're extraordinarily high.
                    So, my heart is still, if not in San Francisco-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: It's in the West where I grew up. But we like NeEngland. It's a very
                    pleasant area.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Don, you then retired into the New England world of
                        ice ansnow and occasional sun. What did you do while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I started and then finished a book on Sudan called Inside Sudan, which
                    was published by Westview Press in 1999. Julie and I concentrated on getting our
                    son Brian through high school in New England. That didn't work out well. He had
                    spent two school years in Mexico after he and Julie and been evacuated, and
                    that's where he really wanted to go, we found. So she and he went back there for
                    a year while I awaited a UN appointment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I had been asked by the Department if I would go out to Liberia as the
                    UN secretary general's special representative there. That was fine with me.
                    Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali wanted an American, and the Department
                    chose me. But it wasn't too much longer after that, while my wife and son were
                    in Mexico and I was about to go off to Liberia (I thought), that the whole deal
                    went sour as Boutros-Ghali and the U.S. government parted ways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Madeleine Albright opposed his re-nomination, as you know, and he
                    decided he no longer wanted an American for the job in Liberia. A decision on
                    who would get the appointment was held in abeyance until after the new secretary
                    general was chosen. I remained the U.S. candidate. I waited and waited. But it
                    turned out that Kofi Annan was advised by his staff to choose an African, which
                    he did.</p>
                <p>But in that year, we got our son through high school, I made a lot of progress on
                    the book, and got more established in the area. After Brian graduated from high
                    school in Mexico City, he went to Israel to work in a kibbutz for five months.
                    Julie and I, who for the first time since in 35 years did not have at least one
                    of our children living with us, took a trip by car from New Hampshire to
                    California and back again. In two months, we passed through twenty states,
                    visiting friends and family along the way.</p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>Back in New Hampshire, in the summer of 1998 we took out a mortgage on our
                    Brentwood house to cover a loan for one in Exeter. We repaired and remodeled the
                    Exeter house it so that it would be suitable for a school. Julie, who was a very
                    skilled schoolteacher and had worked in Washington, Somalia, and Tanzania, had
                    for years wanted to run her own school. Now she could, and in September she
                    opened a small pre-school. I was doing some work on Sudan and had started
                    writing another book, on the revolution in Zanzibar in 1964, what happened to
                    the Americans there, and how Zanzibar became for a time a major Cold War issue.
                    Just before the school opened, I had a phone call from the State Department
                    asking me if I would go out to Liberia to act as charg� for a couple of months
                    or so. I said, “Sure.”Q: You were in Liberia from when to when?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I got there in early October 1998 and left at about thend of the
                    following summer.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the situation? How had things developed up before you got there? I
                    mean, why was there so much interest in Liberia at that point?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Liberia had always had what the Liberians called “a special
                    relationship” with the United States. It stemmed from the way Liberia was
                    founded and from the interest the United States took in the country after World
                    War II, when we built an important airfield, Roberts Field, not far from
                    Monrovia. In the post-war years, Liberia became important to the U.S. as the
                    site of an intelligence communications facility, a Loran navigation facility,
                    and a VOA transmitter for Africa. The Liberian government became a staunch U.S.
                    ally in the Cold War. We had a very large embassy, a huge USAID mission, and a
                    military mission. The close ties between Washington and Monrovia were buffeted
                    by the violent, bloody overthrow of the Tolbert government by Master Sergeant
                    Samuel Doe in 1980. Washington learned to live with Doe, but by the late 1980s
                    relations deteriorated because of the Doe government's corruption and
                    human-rights abuses. Doe's excesses and megalomania contributed to his overthrow
                    in 1990.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: The insurgency that toppled Doe was started by a man named Charles
                    Taylor. In my view, Taylor fully lived up to the negative impression I had of
                    him when I met him in northern Liberia in 1990. He and other warlords, fighting
                    the Liberian army and each other and clashing with a West African peacekeeping
                    force, devastated the entire country. During the war, from 150,000 to 200,000
                    Liberians were killed and tens of thousands were displaced. Doe was captured and
                    killed in August 1990, tortured to death by a man named Prince Johnson, one of
                    the warlords. Taylor eventually prevailed. He came to power in 1997 through an
                    election. Because the Liberians were so sick and tired of war, they were ready
                    to vote for anybody if that would end the fighting. They knew that if Taylor
                    were not elected, he would go back to war. In this way Charles Taylor became
                    president of Liberia.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Once in office, Taylor began to commit gross violations of human
                    rights. For example, one of his political opponents was murdered by Taylor'
                    security forces. Taylor also began to amass a fortune in various unprincipled
                    ways. He made little effort to hide this, believing that it was his due as the
                    elected leader of Liberia. The U.S. government at first gave Taylor the benefit
                    of the doubt, hoping that democracy would take hold, that Taylor would be
                    prevailed upon to change his ways. Some gullible Americans, including Jessie
                    Jackson and some people on the Hill, thought that he would, with their guidance,
                    become a responsible leader. That did not happen. In time, it became clear that
                    he was a thug whose his only interest was in feathering his own nest and
                    maintaining himself in power.</p>
                <p>There was internal opposition to him, but he crushed it whenever it appeared to
                    take on momentum. In 1998 one of the other former warlords, Roosevelt Johnson,
                    was ensconced in Monrovia with his own force. This became intolerable to Taylor,
                    and a clash occurred. One of the results of that clash was that the Taylor
                    security forces defeated Johnson's force and chased him and several of his men
                    through a part of Monrovia. Johnson and his people, fleeing for their lives,
                    headed for the American embassy, where they hoped they could get sanctuary. The
                    embassy's charg� d'affaires, John Bauman, the regional security officer, and two
                    American contract security officers who headed the embassy's guard force went
                    out into the street to negotiate with the heavily armed Liberian security
                    elements that had followed the Johnson party right to the gates of the embassy.
                    Johnson and his men, unseen by their Liberian enemies, cowered behind a
                    barricade by the gate. With the negotiations leading nowhere, Bauman walked back
                    through the turnstile at the gate into the embassy compound. At the point, the
                    leader of the Liberian security force, who had tacitly indicated to his men that
                    they could use force, walked away. His men pushed toward the barricade and as
                    soon as they spied the Johnson party, they opened fire. In the melee several
                    people were killed. The turnstile, which had been opened for Bauman had not been
                    closed, and Johnson and others, including the three Americans in the street,
                    rushed through. One of Johnson's men was shot, and died in the embassy lobby.
                    The regional security officer was slightly wounded, and one of the two contract
                    security officers was seriously wounded.</p>
                <p>All the Americans attached to the U.S. mission came to the compound. It seemed to
                    the Americans that the embassy was under siege. Negotiations between the two
                    governments began, conducted for the most part by telephone. Jessie Jackson in
                    Washington took part in this, talking to Taylor. After several days, agreement
                    was reached that Johnson and the other Liberians in the embassy would be flown
                    out by U.S. military helicopter. They later were taken to Nigeria. That ended
                    the standoff at the embassy, but the affair left a lot of bad feelings on both.
                    It also raised questions in Washington about the way the incident had been
                    handled, about the judgment of the charg� and the security officer.</p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>Two weeks after this occurred, Washington called me, and within a matter of days
                    I was in Monrovia. The African bureau wanted to allow the charg� to have his
                    long-deferred home leave, and they believed someone with experience was needed
                    to take over the embassy in his absence.</p>
                <p>Q: Before you went out there, what sort of briefing were you getting about what
                    from the State Department? You know, how were you prepared to go out?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I prepared myself as well as I could by, first, mining the Internet. I
                    had some familiarity with Liberia. I was the director of the Liberian Task Force
                    for a few months in the summer and fall of 1990. I had met Charles Taylor during
                    that time, as well as other Liberians and heads of state in the region, when I
                    made a trip there. When I got to Washington, I read through files, asked
                    questions, and got what briefing I could during the short time that arrangements
                    were being made to put me on the rolls as a temporary employee and get me out to
                    Monrovia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had Jim Bishop been there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: He had been ambassador from 1987 to 1990. The most recent ambassador
                    to Liberia had been Bill Milam, who left Monrovia shortly before the shooting
                    incident. His assignment had been cut short to enable him to fill, on an urgent
                    basis, the vacant ambassadorship in Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Bill...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Milam, M-I-L-A-M, William Milam. When Milam left foIslamabad, the DCM
                    became charg� d'affaires.</p>
                <p>Armed with as much information as I could get, I went out to take over the
                    embassy. I had, as I saw it, two essential things to do. One was to restore
                    morale at the embassy. The second was to see if we could pick up the pieces of
                    the relationship with the Liberians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This included Charles Taylor? I mean, now the
                        relationship,Charles Taylor was still the president?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have any reservations about dealing with him at
                        this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Very much so. But we had to deal with him if we were going to pursue
                    our objectives, the most immediate of which was to get an apology from the
                    Liberian government, from Taylor, for the actions of the security forces. Not
                    only had they had pointed small arms at the American embassy and then opened
                    fire, but also they had fired at least two recoilless rifle grenades, which
                    passed over the embassy. The chancery suffered bullet damage, and of course two
                    Americans had been wounded. This was a very, very serious incident, and Taylor
                    had not apologized.</p>
                <p>The first problem I had to deal with was the state of mind of the U.S. mission
                    personnel. They were still hunkered down, at least figuratively. They had
                    believed that the embassy had been in danger of being overrun by armed Liberian
                    security forces. They literally lived in the safe haven area of the building for
                    a time, and then in embassy offices for about two weeks. Many of them had been,
                    I found, traumatized by the events. Some of them seemed fixated on what had
                    happened.</p>
                <p>When I landed in Monrovia (Roberts Field was still closed to large aircraft, but
                    I took a small a small airline in from the Ivory Coast into Roberts Field), the
                    administrative officer and the military attach� met me. This was the first time
                    that anybody had left the embassy compound since the incident had taken place
                    almost a month earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I went to the embassy, talked to people, and within an hour or so,
                    said I wanted to go around the town. I got a third-country national who knew
                    Liberians very well to drive me. We toured the devastated city of Monrovia and
                    its environs so I could get a sense of what the situation was. Back at the
                    embassy, I met and talked with everyone. I encouraged people to get out of the
                    compound and move about the town. I said I believed that whatever danger had
                    existed was now largely dissipated and that there was no threat directed against
                    Americans. At a meeting of all hands, I let them know that I cared about their
                    welfare, understood what they had been through, and sympathized with them. I
                    commended them for what they had done. But I felt, and I let them know, that it
                    was time that we got back to normal operations.</p>
                <p>Before long, it was apparent that morale had picked up considerably. I'd never
                    been to a post where morale was in such a bad state as it was when I arrived at
                    Monrovia.</p>
                <p>Q: An embassy being somewhat under siege was not new. I mean, it had happened
                    before. Had there been an effort? Often we've sent in Marines or something like
                    that. Did we have Marines around?</p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: As you know, there had been evacuations in Liberia before, in 1990 for
                    example. With fighting taking place in the outskirts of Monrovia, when I went to
                    the embassy on a two-day visit in October of that year, a U.S. naval vessel was
                    standing by and a contingent of U.S. soldiers had been sent in to provide
                    protection for the embassy. So the kind of trouble that had arisen in 1998 was
                    nothing new. This time, there were no outside U.S. troops brought in for
                    protection. The embassy's marine guard detachment was there, of course. In full
                    battle gear, they manned posts at key points, including a sandbagged post on the
                    roof. But, again, I felt that the problem was over with respect to any danger to
                    the embassy and to the Americans serving in Monrovia. And quite frankly, a few
                    people there were exaggerating the extent of the danger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: After I had been in Monrovia for a while, I concluded that except
                    momentarily at the time of the incident, the Liberian security forces would not
                    have entered the embassy grounds, and that afterward the Liberian government had
                    no plan to overrun the embassy. Nevertheless, the perception of the people who
                    had been through the ordeal, and it was a real ordeal, was that there been great
                    danger. Some were still jittery. They needed to be brought out of that state of
                    mind and to get back to a normal existence. That certainly included leaving the
                    embassy compound. Monrovia is one of the few embassies we have where most or all
                    the American employees live inside a compound.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Which isn't the best situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, it's not. The families had already been
                        evacuated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. Because conditions in Monrovia were so bad, even though the war
                    had ended three years earlier, there was only one or two embassy spouses there
                    when the trouble erupted. Children were not permitted at post. All the time I
                    was there, the Department's ban on dependents remained in force. Before I left,
                    I had concluded that the restriction on dependents should be lifted and said so
                    to Washington. However, as I pointed out when I was talking about Sudan, once
                    dependents are evacuated, it is very, very hard to convince the Department to
                    let them return to post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: It generally takes a long time.</p>
                <p>As I was saying, I did the kind of things any ambassador should have done to
                    restore confidence, exert leadership, and put the post back on a good footing. I
                    was pleased by the results.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When they had been holed up in the compound, how were
                        thegetting food? I mean, was there any? What were they doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: [Laughter] The embassy had a very well stocked commissary. And people
                    had some items in their apartments, foodstuff that they brought with them. And
                    if they really needed something from the Lebanese-owed grocery stores in town,
                    members of the Liberian guard force could go get it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: The commissary had been a lifesaver and still was reasonably well
                    stocked. But, again, I deemed it essential that people get out of the compound
                    and return to a normal existence. This they began doing. I soon approved letting
                    those who had apartments in the USAID compound across the street from the
                    embassy return to them. In addition, within a month I had begun traveling
                    up-country. I took an embassy officer with me. As a result of that trip, I
                    lifted the 25-mile limit that the previous ambassador had placed on travel
                    outside Monrovia and I encouraged mission personnel who had reason to travel
                    up-country to do so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about getting out, reestablishing relations with
                        thgovernment? How did you go about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I went to see government officials. I met with the foreign minister
                    and with advisors to the president. From day one, I persisted in seeking an
                    appointment with Taylor. But because he knew that I would be presenting him with
                    a demand for an apology, he didn't want to meet with me. Nevertheless, through
                    my own contacts, and the contacts that the military attach� and other officers
                    were now making, we were able to get a dialogue going with the Liberians. I made
                    it clear to the foreign minister and to others in the government that there had
                    to be an apology. Taylor's line, which was repeated by his advisors, was that
                    the Liberians had done nothing wrong, that the incident had been a
                    misunderstanding, that there was no intention to harm anybody, that the Liberian
                    security people were fired on first, and so forth. I said that I had thoroughly
                    studied the situation and knew that the Liberian security forces had opened fire
                    without provocation. Washington was fully aware of this from the embassy's
                    reporting. An apology was necessary.</p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>This went on for weeks. The deputy assistant secretary of state who had
                    responsibility for Liberia, Vicki Huddleston, came out and repeated what I had
                    been saying. She told Taylor in a very forceful way that if Liberia wanted to
                    resume a reasonable relationship with the United States, there had to be an
                    apology. Soon afterward, it came. At first it was a left-handed kind of apology,
                    an expression of regret that there had been some difficulty - something of that
                    nature. Eventually, we got the apology from Taylor in the right terminology.
                    Normal relations were resumed. It was not by any means a warm and cuddly
                    relationship, given the government's continued human rights violations and the
                    fact that Taylor was assisting the rebels in Sierra Leone. His support for them
                    became the single most important bone of contention between the United States
                    and Liberia during the rest of the time that I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What had happened? Did we still have our communications
                        set uand all in Liberia, or was this being phased out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: You mean the VOA?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The VOA and all those things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: The VOA transmitter and the other U.S. government communications
                    facilities had long since been closed down. In fact, they had been trashed
                    during the war. Even the power lines serving them had been stripped, stolen for
                    their copper content. By the time that the facilities were closed down, the
                    United States government had made alternative arrangements in other places in
                    Africa. The importance of those facilities was no longer a factor in the
                    U.S.-Liberian relationship.</p>
                <p>Q: So we didn't really have much that we needed from Liberia? Our interest was
                    more of a general one, a humanitarian and normal relations and all that?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. The passing of the Cold War eliminated whatever putative
                    international political importance Liberia had had. Former President Doe played
                    the anticommunist and anti-Libyan cards for all they were worth, and Liberia was
                    well endowed with American aid. But those days were over for good.</p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>Our basic interest was humanitarian. Beyond that was the continuation of an
                    historical relationship that had begun with the establishment of Liberia by
                    former slaves from America in the 19th century. At the outset, there was no
                    close tie between the U.S. government and Liberia, for the American government
                    had nothing to do with the repatriation of those slaves. Arrangements for the
                    repatriation and the founding of the colony were made by the American
                    Colonization Society, an anti-slavery organization. The United States was not in
                    a hurry to recognize Liberia when in 1840 it declared itself a republic, and
                    showed little interest in it until the 20th century, when Harvey Firestone
                    established a rubber plantation and factory there. Closer ties came during World
                    War II when the U.S. built an important airfield near Monrovia. Then came the
                    Cold War and the establishment of the communications facilities that I mentioned
                    earlier and the advent of the large U.S. economic and military aid programs for
                    Liberia.</p>
                <p>Liberians viewed the historical tie as a special relationship. This sentiment was
                    shared by some African-Americans, including some prominent, influential
                    individuals. There was a belief that the United States had benefitted in the
                    past from the relationship and therefor had an obligation to help Liberia.With
                    the kind of government that Liberia now had, the concept of the special
                    relationship was debatable. I believed very strongly that the United States had
                    an obligation to do all we could to provide humanitarian assistance to Liberia,
                    to help its people, who had been so mistreated by successive governments and
                    whose lives had been disrupted beyond imagining by the awful civil war. Tens of
                    thousands were still displaced from their home villages and were destitute. But
                    I felt just as strongly that we owed Charles Taylor and followers nothing. We
                    needed to avoid any kind of economic aid that would strengthen Taylor's control
                    of the country and give him opportunity to add to his plunder. Instead of doing
                    anything to revive Liberia's moribund economy, Taylor and his associates were
                    robbing the country blind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How could we meet humanitarian needs without enriching
                        Taylor ancohorts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Very easily, actually - not provide them with the kind of aid they
                    wanted. They wanted capital assistance projects, the kind that would involve big
                    contracts, from which they would get a cut. They wanted contractors who could be
                    bribed and an influx of resources that could be ripped off.</p>
                <p>The United States was having none of that. It channeled its aid mainly through UN
                    agencies, such as the WFP (World Food Program), UNICEF, and UNHCR (UN High
                    Commission for Refugees) - the kind of assistance that people needed to ward off
                    diseases and to get food and shelter. In addition we provided assistance to help
                    strengthen the judicial system and democratic institutions, such as a free
                    press, and to bolster human rights organizations. We aimed to help give the
                    Liberian people a greater ability to stand up to their government. And we hoped
                    to promote a better attitude among key people in the country regarding how
                    Liberia should be governed.</p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>None of this was pleasing to Mr. Taylor, who continued to rule in an autocratic
                    and undemocratic way and to violate human rights left right and center.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You keep talking about violating human rights.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what this meant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: In 1997, Taylor's security people murdered the most prominent of
                    Taylor's political opponents. Roosevelt Johnson's tribesmen, the Krahn, were
                    hounded. During the fighting that broke out in September 1998, three hundred or
                    more Krahn were captured or otherwise seized and summarily executed. People were
                    arrested without due process, some were tortured. The government intimidated the
                    press. Freedom of association and speech were abridged. There was fear in the
                    country that the security forces could work their will whenever they wanted. It
                    was also a violation of human rights when the government failed to do anything
                    to provide resources that were so desperately needed for basic services to
                    people - running water, electricity, housing, schooling for children, medical
                    services. In Liberia under Charles Taylor, egregious violations of the human
                    rights of the Liberian were a constant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was in it for them to deal with us at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Because the United States is the strongest country in the world, it
                    carries great influence with international organizations that can make decisions
                    favorable or unfavorable to a country like Liberia. To make progress
                    economically, Liberia needed to attract private investment. Its ability to do
                    that was impaired by its poor relations with the United States. In addition, in
                    Liberia there is a sense that no Liberian government can really succeed without
                    the blessing of the United States, which is seen, as some Liberians told me, as
                    “our father.” Others told me that the U.S. was “our mother,” and others called
                    it “our big brother.” So - father, mother, big brother. No Liberian leader could
                    be totally comfortable if he was at odds with the United States.Although our
                    influence helped in some ways to improve the lot of the Liberian people, it was
                    not such that Taylor would change his behavior and begin to do the right things
                    not only for the Liberian people but also for the people of Sierra Leone. His
                    support for Sierra Leonean rebels contributed to a terrible war in which rebel
                    forces were committing the worst kinds of atrocities, cutting off people's hands
                    and arms-</p>

                <p>PETTERSON: Men's, women's, and children's. Wanton killing, a statof vicious
                    anarchy.</p>
                <p>Q: When you look at what happened in Liberia and then Sierra Leone, you know,
                    what was the root of this viciousness? I mean, you know, there's a difference
                    between taking over and destroying villages, and particularly when you start
                    maiming children. But the whole thing seemed to have gone down to a level of
                    depravity that we haven't seen in a long time.</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Well, we have seen it in former Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Why did it happen in Liberia and then in Sierra Leone? It's hard to
                    say. The hatreds that grew between contending organizations were tribally based,
                    for one. One side would do something to another, then the other side would
                    retaliate, and then it would get out of hand. It got to the point that human
                    life had no meaning for some of these fighters, many of whom were children, or
                    barely teenagers, who often were plied with liquor or drugs and told to do
                    things and did them - terrible acts that they normally would never have
                    committed. There was a spiral downward of terrible, mindless violence. It
                    happened first in Liberia, then in Sierra Leone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Taylor doing in Sierra Leone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Diamonds. Diamonds were at the heart of the descent of Sierra Leone,
                    from a country that could have been prosperous to a country that is one of the
                    most devastated, poorest countries of the world. From the time of Sierra Leone's
                    independence greedy men sought to get a share of the diamond wealth that was
                    being produced from the country's diamond mines. Diamonds corrupted the leader
                    of the country, Siaka Stevens, and just about everyone else in high positions.
                    The diamond producing areas were in the northern part of Sierra Leone. In years
                    past, the diamond production had been largely a controlled enterprise, but even
                    then there were many illegal diggers. A considerable portion of the illegally
                    mined diamonds was smuggled out through Liberia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: With the advent of the war in Sierra Leone, no longer was diamond
                    mining a controlled enterprise, in part or in whole. The RUF made arrangements
                    with the diggers and, in collusion with Liberians and with Taylor's blessing,
                    got the diamonds into Liberia and from there to the world market. In exchange
                    for his cut, Taylor was helping the rebels in various ways, including providing
                    them with arms and ammunition. Some of this war materiel came from Libya and was
                    flown to Liberia from Burkina Faso.</p>
                <p>Taylor continued his involvement in this even though the United States government
                    and others, the British government in particular, told him to stop it. A
                    cease-fire in Sierra Leone was brokered in July 1999, shortly before I left
                    Liberia. Later it broke down, and hostilities resumed. In 2000, a UN report
                    implicated Taylor in his dealings in diamonds with the RUF, arms trafficking,
                    and other kinds of profiteering. In May 2001, the Security Council imposed
                    sanctions against Taylor for backing and arming the rebel group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: As recently as a few months ago, accusations were still being levied
                    against Taylor, charging that he was helping perpetuate the situation in Sierra
                    Leone by continuing to assist the rebels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there, was the United Nations playing any
                        role, othe Organization of African Unity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: The OAU (Organization of African Unity) wasn't, but some West African
                    countries, Nigeria in particular, were. Going back to the early 1990s, a West
                    African force in Liberia, ECOMOG (Economic Community of West African States
                    Monitoring Group) had been based in Liberia, first to fight against Taylor's
                    National Patriotic Liberation Front and then to keep the peace. In 1999, the
                    ECOMOG force was made up of Nigerians, the largest contingent, and Ghanaians. By
                    that time, it was pretty ineffective. Because of the growing intensity of the
                    conflict in Sierra Leone and with Freetown itself in danger of being overrun by
                    the RUF, the remaining ECOMOG troops in Liberia were sent to Freetown.</p>
                <p>The United Nations Special Representative did not take a strong stand against
                    Taylor. Many members of the international community in Monrovia, including UN
                    personnel, believed that he was too close to Taylor and to someone else in a
                    high-level position in the Liberian government. I subscribed to that
                    opinion.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was he?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: Felix Downes-Thomas, a Gambian. He did not take firm enough stands on
                    human rights violations. I tried to enlist his support for strong statements,
                    which I routinely made publicly, that there had to be a change in the behavior
                    of the Liberian government if the Liberian government was to be accepted
                    internationally. Downes-Thomas said he said he would, but he did not follow
                    through with anything approaching consistency. I did not get useful backing from
                    the Special Representative. On the other hand, I had a good relationship with
                    the United Nations agencies that were participating in the humanitarian aid
                    program in Liberia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was our unhappiness and distrust of this UN man from
                        Gambia beintransmitted back to various channels to the United Nations
                        headquarters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I transmitted my thoughts on his performance to Washington. And yes,
                    the State Department did make its displeasure known to the UN. But on what
                    level, I don't know. Whatever was said apparently made no appreciable
                    difference, for he remained in his post.</p>
                <p>Let me emphasize, though, that the UN performance in Liberia was good. My opinion
                    of the quality of the representatives of the various UN agencies with which I
                    was associated in Africa ranged from excellent to abysmal. In Sudan, Phillip
                    O'Brien, an Irishman who was the UNICEF representative in Nairobi and headed
                    Operations Lifeline Sudan was superb. In Khartoum, one head of a UN agency was
                    pathetically inept. But in my view, the problem with UN operations in a given
                    country stems as much from the UN system itself as it does from the quality of
                    UN personnel. The UN agencies are like baronies. Each head of agency is
                    answerable to his agency's home office and not to the ranking UN official at the
                    post. If, as was the case in Sudan and Somalia when I was ambassador, the head
                    of UNDP, who was the ranking UN official, holding the title of UN coordinator,
                    wanted the head of, say, UNICEF to do a certain thing, the coordinator had to
                    rely on his powers of persuasion to get it done. Coordination could be, and
                    often was, a sometime thing, not well done at all. I thought to myself more than
                    once that if I, as ambassador, did not have authority over all U.S. officials in
                    country, regardless of their agency, I would find it intolerable and be hampered
                    in my effectiveness.Having said all that, for the most part I had good relations
                    with the UN people I worked with. This was generally the case in Liberia. I
                    worked closely with officials of the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for
                    Refugees). They were doing an excellent job of helping rehabilitate refugees of
                    the Liberian civil war who had returned to their devastated villages and Sierra
                    Leoneans who were in refugee camps in Liberia. I went up-country with
                    representatives of the UNHCR to various places, to see what was being done, and
                    I have nothing but praise for them.</p>
                <p>Q: Now, talking about up country, brings to mind, in earlier interviews with
                    people serving in Liberia back in the good ol' (old) days and all...</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: [Laughter]</p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>Q: There were the Americo-Liberians, who represented a very distinct class, not
                    really a tribe, but a class that sat there, and then everyone else was out in
                    the bush, and we didn't have much to do with that. Had the whole dynamics
                    changed?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Oh, yes. The Americo-Liberians were descendants of slaves who had
                    either established the colony or had settled in Liberia in ensuing years and of
                    slaves who, after slavery was outlawed, were brought to Monrovia after the slave
                    ships in which they were being transported were seized. The Americo-Liberians
                    became the dominant political force in the country. They erected a kind of black
                    apartheid to maintain power, depriving the indigenous people of equal rights.
                    The overbearing, short-sighted ways of the Americo-Liberians led to their
                    downfall in 1980, when Samuel Doe overthrew the government, killing the
                    leadership in the process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Today in Liberia the clear distinction between the Americo-Liberians
                    and other Liberians no longer defines the country's politics. Americo-Liberians
                    and people of indigenous tribal origins alike occupy positions of importance in
                    the government. However, underlying ill-feeling between those called “Americos”
                    or “Congos” (as they are sometimes referred to) and those who are called
                    “Country” remains and surfaces from time to time (especially on the Internet).
                    In addition, other tribal animosities still continue to be a fact of life in
                    Liberia. The killing of Krahns in 1998 testifies to that.</p>
                <p>Q: Now, did the Libyans play any role in this, because they, over the years under
                    Qadhafi, have been sort of troublemakers, at least one perspective?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Libyan involvement in Liberia while I was there in 1998-1999 was
                    confined to the supply of weapons through Burkina Faso and Liberia into Sierra
                    Leone. Taylor had received military training in Libya before he started the
                    insurgency in 1989 and continues to have close ties with Qadhafi. There is no
                    question that arms and ammunition destined for the RUF in Sierra Leone
                    originated in Libya.</p>

                <p>PETTERSON: Not really, no. Qadhafi was not playing the prominenrole that he had
                    played earlier on in West Africa.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The time you were there, was the Taylor regime beginning

                </p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: Absolutely NOT!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: I did finally get to see Taylor, in late January 1999. The main point
                    of what I said to him was a warning from Washington to cease helping the rebels
                    in Sierra Leone or face sanctions. I told him that U.S. evidence of Liberia's
                    support for the RUF was incontrovertible and that it did the Liberians no good
                    to keep denying the charges. As I expected, he reacted defensively, denying that
                    his government was involved in Sierra Leone. I also expressed concern about his
                    government's human rights abuses, especially those committed by the security
                    forces. I suggested that the government should, among other things, rein in the
                    security forces, allow full freedom of the press, and stop harassing judges.
                    Taylor responded that much of what was being said about human rights in Liberia
                    was untrue. I remember that in my reporting cable to Washington I said that
                    although I was not in a position to comment on the often-heard view that Taylor
                    was an inveterate liar, I could now say from personal experience that he took
                    large liberties with the truth.</p>
                <p>Although I had been very frank in our talk, I had tried to keep the conversation
                    on a friendly level. But Taylor was not a man who liked to hear frank criticism,
                    no matter how it was put to him. He avoided seeing me again for some months.</p>
                <p>In private talks and public remarks, I stressed that while the U.S. government
                    wanted to work with Liberia's democratically elected government, Washington
                    remained concerned about the excesses of the executive branch and the misconduct
                    of the security forces. I also emphasized that for Liberia's economy to improve,
                    it needed a strong private sector, but that the government's misguided economic
                    policies and rampant corruption discouraged private investment from both
                    domestic and foreign sources.</p>
                <p>U.S. admonitions did not have much appreciable effect. Now and then, Taylor would
                    do something that we asked. For example, we got the apology, and eventually he
                    did begin to do some right things with respect to Sierra Leone, at least
                    momentarily. But essentially he was the same criminal that he always had been,
                    and his actions were harmful to Liberia's relationship with the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said you wanted to get the embassy out doing things.

                        like that, say what does a political officer do, I mean if there's no real
                        politics? It's all-</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: Ah, but there was plenty to do. There was politics. There was politics
                    within the governing party. There was an opposition, however weak it was. The
                    beginning of a revolt against Taylor was evident in northwestern Liberia.
                    Liberia's involvement in Sierra Leone and other foreign affairs issues needed to
                    be reported. All kinds of crooked economic deals were being made in Liberia.
                    There was no end of what a reporting officer worth his or her salt could do. I
                    encouraged the political/economic section to be very active.</p>
                <p>I participated with the officer in the political section who was in charge of the
                    embassy's self-help program, which made good use of limited resources for
                    grassroots projects. I would accompany her to projects she had developed, mainly
                    within a two-hour drive from Monrovia. I traveled up-country as often as I could
                    and would always ask people to go with me. And I encouraged them to do some
                    travels on their own.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's talk about the political situation a little. What were we looking at?
                    What were we doing, not just reporting? How did the political officer or the
                    economic officer operate in this situation?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: In the same basic way that a political or economic officer would carry
                    out his or her responsibilities anywhere. You get out, go around town, talk to
                    people, gather information, and travel outside of town. The embassy's
                    political-economic officers did get around. Unfortunately, there were others in
                    the embassy who were not inclined to travel very much, if at all. But, overall
                    the embassy had resumed its normal functioning.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, were there things like road blocks with a couple of pre teenagers with
                    AK-47s who would stop you and say, “Give me your car!” or something like
                    that?</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: There were roadblocks, and you simply had to go through them. Our
                    vehicles had diplomatic plates, and when I traveled, the flag was [laughter]
                    flying. Occasionally there were some minor problems at roadblocks, but they
                    eased off as the weeks and months went by.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you have any problems with our staff? Sometimes you get people that start
                    playing games with roadblocks, get angry and all, which is not the way to handle
                    it. You know, I have served in Saigon and Korea, where they've had nighttime
                    things, and you don't mess around with roadblocks.</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: No, no one played games at roadblocks. For most of thtime I was there,
                    I did not allow nighttime traveling.</p>
                <p>

                <p>PETTERSON: Our people were well aware that some of the individualat roadblocks
                    were not the kind of people you wanted to trifle with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because it was a pandemic, I guess, you'd call it, of
                        AIDS, wathat a problem in Liberia at the time you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: No, there was not a high incidence of AIDS in Liberia. Liberia had
                    major health problems - malaria, serious malnutrition, gastrointestinal
                    diseases, and other maladies - but AIDS was not among them. It did exist, but
                    compared to some other places in Africa, the infection rate was low. Less than
                    three percent of adults had HIV/AIDS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about other countries? Although Nigeria is at some
                        remove, it was sort of, I would imagine, a major least English speaking
                        country around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Nigeria played the leading role in the West African military force,
                    ECOMOG, and in ECOWAS (Economic Community Of West African States). Nigeria is by
                    far the dominant power in West Africa because of its size and its wealth. With
                    the advent of a better government, when Obasanjo was elected after the death of
                    the odious General Sani Abacha, it seemed that Nigeria could deal more
                    effectively in the Liberia-Sierra Leone situations. It was hoped that Obasanjo
                    could exert a fatherly influence over Taylor. That appeared to be a possibility
                    for a while, but Taylor doesn't listen to anybody for very long. He'll often say
                    the right things when you meet with him, but then he'll continue doing what he
                    had been doing before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there, was there much attention coming
                        froWashington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. Because of the historical tie between Liberia and the United
                    States, the large number of Liberians living in the United States, and the
                    empathy of the African American community, or segments of it, for Liberia, there
                    was a continuing fairly high level of attention given to the Liberian
                    problem.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you get much direction, instruction, that sort of thing from Washington?
                    Or were they, sort of, you'd been around the block, you knew what you were
                    doing, and sort of let you say, “Well, go ahead and do it.”</p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: I gave Washington my thoughts as to what we needed to do, and how I
                    saw the situation. Certainly I got instructions, as all ambassadors do, but
                    essentially my relationship with the State Department was one of mutual
                    consultation. With the communications revolution having finally caught with
                    State Department, I was able to pick up the phone and be immediately connected.
                    Unlike my earlier days in Africa, it was now quite easy to talk with people in
                    Washington as frequently as I needed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there when, in the summer of '99, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who took your place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETTERSON: Let me explain why I stayed on so long and how that was done. After
                    the first two months passed, the Department told me that the charg� d'affaires
                    would not be able to return right then and asked me to stay on for another
                    month. I agreed. Sometime during that month, I was informed that because of
                    questions that had arisen concerning the performance of the embassy during the
                    crisis situation, the charg� would be getting another assignment. I was asked to
                    stay on until a new ambassador, whose processing had begun, could be confirmed
                    by the Senate. The Department expected that this could take place by the late
                    summer of 1999.</p>
                <p>I wasn't keen to stay on for that length of time because I would be separated
                    from my family again, not all that long after our two-year separation when I was
                    in Sudan. But I felt an obligation and a responsibility, and I said I would do
                    it. This required me to be sworn in as a Foreign Service officer again. I stayed
                    in Liberia until July, just before the arrival of the new ambassador, Bismarck
                    Myrick, an African specialist.</p>
                <p>Then I went back to Washington and resigned, and that was that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you left, what did you think about the future of
                        Liberia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>PETTERSON: I could see that as long as Charles Taylor was running that country,
                    there was little hope for Liberia. Any idea that this man would change his spots
                    was mistaken. He simply is not a good person, and he's going to continue do
                    whatever is necessary to maintain himself in power as long as he can, at the
                    expense of the well-being of the Liberian people, at the expense of any
                    possibility for a democratic system in Liberia. He continues to be in bad odor
                    with the U.S. government and to be accused of doing the kind of things that he
                    was doing when I was there. So, whither Liberia depends on how and when Taylor's
                    despotic rule can be ended, and whether decent intelligent Liberians who really
                    care about their country - and there are many Liberians like that - can somehow
                    form a new kind of government, a government responsive to the will of the
                    people. That's a big question. Who knows?</p>
                <p>But for right now, the near-term forecast is not good because Taylois still
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well, Don, I want to thank you very much for this.

                </p>
                <p>There's a footnote here about Sudan. Go ahead.</p>
                <p>PETTERSON: In the summer of 1997, a prominent Sudanese businessman of Syrian
                    extraction, Anise Haggar, asked another former American ambassador to Sudan,
                    William Kontos, and me see if we could come up with ideas for improving
                    relations between Sudan and the United States and ending the war in southern
                    Sudan.</p>
                <p>After touching base with the State Department - we talked with both the assistant
                    secretary of state for African affairs and the under secretary for political
                    affairs - to make sure that our venture would not be counter to U.S. interests,
                    we flew to Khartoum in October. There we met with everyone we could, including
                    President Bashir, others in the government, opponents of the government,
                    southerners, educators, NGO representatives, business and professional people,
                    clergymen. After a week in Khartoum, we went to Nairobi, where we talked with
                    representatives of the rebel factions, Kenyan president Moi, UN personnel, and
                    participants in the East African presidents' peace initiative, the so-called
                    IGAD negotiations. Then we went back to Khartoum for a couple of days before
                    returning to the United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>In Washington we completed a report that included some conclusions we had reached
                    and a set of recommendations. One of our findings was that U.S. policy toward
                    Sudan, however well motivated it might have been, had failed to achieve its
                    objectives. Therefore, the U.S. government should try a new approach. The two
                    key elements of our recommendations were (1) The United States should resume a
                    diplomatic presence in Khartoum, not only to be able to interact with the
                    government, but also to help remedy the gaps in U.S. intelligence on Sudan by
                    being able to report on what was going on in the country. (2) The United States
                    should become involved on a sustained basis in a direct and intense
                    international negotiating effort to end the war in Sudan. The United States
                    should appoint, we believed, a special envoy, a person of international stature,
                    to take a leading role in that effort.</p>
                <p>Our recommendations were not adopted at that time. Within the Clinton
                    administration, animosity toward the Sudanese government had hardened during
                    President Clinton's second term. In particular, the African Bureau of the State
                    Department was convinced that the Sudanese were totally dishonest in their
                    interactions with the Americans on human rights, the war, and other issues.
                    Having shared the frustration of dealing with the Sudanese government for three
                    years, I could sympathize with this viewpoint. But Bill and I felt that this
                    attitude was too rigid and was leading nowhere. We believed that above all else
                    in regard to Sudan, the focus should be on ending the war.</p>
                <p>Bill and I continued our work, participating in sessions on the Sudan issue in
                    various forums, such as the Center for Strategic and International Studies and
                    the United States Institute of Peace. We met from time to time with State
                    Department officials and others in Washington, including congresspersons, and
                    with Sudanese. Bill and I believed that we should continue doing whatever we
                    could to contribute to efforts to bring peace to Sudan, which is of such
                    importance because so many people are dying-</p>

                <p>PETTERSON: Yes. Bill Kontos died in March 2000. It is gratifying to see that the
                    U.S. government has adopted recommendations that we made. A diplomatic presence
                    is being reestablished in Khartoum. There will be no ambassador for a while, I'm
                    sure. But the point is to have professionals on the ground in Khartoum. And the
                    administration is on the verge of naming a special envoy for Sudan. He will, as
                    far I know, embark on a new and intensified effort on the part of the United
                    States to take a direct role in the peace process, which I believe is
                    essential.</p>
