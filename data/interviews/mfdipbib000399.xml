                <p>Q: Today is the 8th of September 1999. This is an interview with Robert E.
                    Fritts.This is being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies
                    and Training, and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. Bob and I are old friends. Could
                    you tell me when, where you were born and something about your family?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: I was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1934. I had the good fortune of being
                    raised in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, then labeled as the “largest village
                    in the world.” In contrast to a Foreign Service career, we didn't move. I went
                    through the entire Oak Park public school system (k-12).</p>
                <p>My parents were born and grew up in St. Joseph, Illinois, a very small town near
                    Champaign-Urbana, home of the University of Illinois. My father, the son of a
                    railroad section track foreman, was poor, but worked his way through the
                    University of Illinois to gain a mechanical engineering degree in 1922. He was a
                    very good, serious and self-disciplined student. Hard to imagine now, but much
                    of his income was earned from trapping muskrats, mink and foxes in and along the
                    sluggish streams of the area. My mother also lived in the town, the daughter of
                    dairy farmers. She became an elementary school teacher. They were high school
                    sweethearts who were married in Chicago after my father found an entry-level
                    management job in the steel industry. Over some 30-plus years, he rose to become
                    executive vice president of a family-owned fabricating firm, Taylor Forge Iron
                    &amp; Pipe Works, now defunct. Indeed, after later being taken over by Gulf and
                    Western, it was razed.In terms of the Foreign Service, their background is
                    interesting only in the context that while I was growing up, neither had any
                    overseas or international exposure or interests. Neither did their parents. Nor
                    for years did they know anyone who did, other than in the immigrant mix of
                    Chicago. Several uncles served in WWII, but they were reticent to talk and had
                    no desire to go abroad again.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>During WWII, my father was judged too important to the war effort for a uniform
                    because of his key role in producing war materiel. In later years, after I was
                    in the Foreign Service, he became somewhat internationally minded as the firm
                    acquired several foreign plants in Scotland and elsewhere, which he visited
                    frequently. In addition, the small firm became one of only three American
                    companies with the skill to forge the large titanium rings that composed the
                    skeletons of Minute Man missiles. In later years, the firm suffered greatly from
                    losing its bread-and-butter business of pipe, fittings and flanges to Western
                    European producers. He held the Marshall Plan responsible. Eventually, my older
                    brother served in the Air Force and also worked for a time in the Philippines. I
                    made international and foreign affairs a life.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, my family portrayed the general pattern of America in the 20th
                    century - from farms, railroads and small towns to the city and industry, from a
                    domestic industrial focus thru WWII to the Cold War and missile defense, from
                    global military strength to trade competition and foreign investment, and a son
                    representing the U.S. abroad in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about life at home? What did one talk about sitting
                        arounthe dinner table? Were there family chats or things of this
                        nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Sure, in those days of “housekeeping Moms”, family dinners were standard.
                    We always had sit-down dinners together. It was a routine and important aspect
                    of a family (parents and two boys).I don't recall much abstract discussion and
                    certainly not on foreign affairs. My father was a firm Republican, although he
                    was also very pro-union. My mother was raised a Democrat and they teased each
                    other about her vote for FDR in 1934 being offset by his vote against. I think
                    it was the last Democrat vote she cast.</p>
                <p>As I recall, most of our table chat was on events of the day, with the exception
                    that my father talked a good deal about leadership and management - of men, of
                    course. He was a fine executive who never lost the common touch. My mother said
                    that his father (a grandfather I never knew) had a town-wide reputation for
                    running the teams who swung pickaxes for him on the Illinois Central railroad
                    track. The men at Taylor Forge apparently loved and respected my father. In
                    fact, no union at the main Cicero plant would sign a collective bargaining
                    agreement unless my father's signature was on it. He had considered views about
                    the capabilities of people and how to motivate them. He believed firmly that he
                    had reciprocal obligations. My brother and I, in our adult lives, followed many
                    of those principles and are much the better for it. Indeed, there were occasions
                    in the Foreign Service when I consciously followed his ideas, such as
                    periodically “walking the plant floor” of an embassy from motor pool to
                    communications, trying to leave each “job” or post better than I found it, and
                    identifying talent wherever it was at whatever level.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the steel business, management wasn't regarded
                        aprogressive. Your father was sort of a maverick, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Not really. He just sincerely cared about men and thought good management
                    was also good business. He was unusual for the time in his belief in and support
                    of unions, in large part because he believed his father than been exploited by
                    the railroad barons of the day.</p>
                <p>Shortly after WWII, the plant had an extended major and violent strike by its
                    certifiably Communist leadership. My father eventually resolved it, in
                    considerable part because the men would not associate my father personally with
                    the “capitalist” stereotypes portrayed by the strike leaders. I well recall from
                    those table conversations a tenet that “Workers don't settle strikes, wives do,”
                    in the sense that wives eventually put pressure on men to go back to work. I
                    came close to trying that once in Kigali when the motor pool “downed tools,” but
                    I wasn't sure if the approach would be cross-culturally transferable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to school in Oak Park, Illinois. Were they
                        publischools?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Yes, all the way through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about elementary school.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: William Hatch School was one of about eight feeder schools into the high
                    school. It provided a very good education with an emphasis on English. I can
                    diagram sentences today to the nth branch. The teachers were excellent. They
                    were all women and unmarried - a carryover from the Depression, WWII and the
                    then-attitude that teaching was one of the few acceptable professions for
                    women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about reading at the elementary level? Do you recall,
                        diyou use the library a lot?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: I don't recall, but I was an inveterate reader as a boy. My grandmother,
                    who lived in St. Joseph, Illinois, had a shelf of Civil War books inherited from
                    her father, who had served with the 72nd Illinois Volunteers. The books were
                    primarily memoirs of Union leaders e.g. Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, Logan etc. I
                    learned to read literately from those books, including by flashlight under a
                    blanket in her house. A love of reading, of history, of non-fiction and of great
                    men doing great things came from those volumes. I have them today at her
                    behest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What spurred your grandmother to have those Civil War
                        memoirs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>FRITTS: Her father was a Civil War veteran. He, like tens of thousands of others,
                    was part of a large market for books about the war in which he and they had
                    fought. The books were marketed by book bummerswho peddled them by horse and
                    wagon throughout the farms, towns and Grand Army of the Republic posts of a
                    still mostly rural America, including St. Joseph. It was a good business. My
                    grandmother had very few books and I doubt her father did. But she had these and
                    treasured them even, though I suspect she had never read them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The high school - was it called Oak Park High School?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Actually, the Oak Park &amp; River Forest Township High School. It was
                    unusual for its time - quite large (about 2400 students) with functional
                    buildings and grounds - almost like a small college in a middle-class suburb of
                    western Chicago. It was recognized as one of the preeminent public high schools
                    in the country. Again, English was emphasized. Even expository writing was
                    virtually required. The English teachers lamented that Ernest Hemingway, an Oak
                    Parker, had dropped out years before. They felt his writing would have been
                    improved under their tutelage. About 90 percent of the graduates went on to
                    college, which was unusual for any public high school then. For most Americans,
                    secondary school is a very formative period and I was fortunate to live in Oak
                    Park.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What courses particularly interested you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, I guess, the social sciences. I enjoyed history and literature.
                    Though few of us would admit it, I also enjoyed English and writing, in part
                    because they didn't seem difficult. They gave us a lot to read and I was a fast
                    reader. We also memorized poetry and I learned a few tricks that later came into
                    good stead when delivering “Talking Points” and writing up memoranda of
                    conversation (”memcons”) and reporting cables. My handwriting was/is awful, so I
                    learned to touch-type - without doubt the most useful course of my life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about extra-curricular activities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: I was much involved. I played football and basketball and was elected or
                    appointed to a lot of student offices - all those kinds of things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Oak Park a sort of upper middle-class type
                        school?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, more just middle class. Oak Park didn't have much of a blue-collar
                    component and its white collars were primarily lower management professionals.
                    Any affluent upper crust came from the adjacent and much smaller suburb of River
                    Forest. There were no student minorities of color.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's see, you were in high school from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: '48 to '52.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about foreign events?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, that period was during the second Truman administration. I remember
                    being involved in debating clubs in which we took on particular issues of the
                    day, such as the St. Lawrence Seaway. And maybe we debated foreign policy
                    issues, the UN comes vaguely to mind, but, frankly, foreign affairs were not
                    high on my peer's agenda or on mine.</p>
                <p>Q: While you were going there, the Korean War started. Did that intrude at
                    all?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Not really, I was only fourteen. I was in the back seat as my parents
                    drove to our annual vacation when the radio announced the North Korean invasion
                    of South Korea. My father was concerned and discussed with my mother the
                    implications for the plant. I think our vacation was cut short. My mother was
                    concerned my older brother might be called to service. Naturally, I read the
                    newspapers and traced the arrows indicating where the troops were going, but, at
                    that age, you have other interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you graduated in '52. Did you know where you
                        wergoing to go, or what were you pointing towards?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: I did and it wasn't the Foreign Service, of which I knew nothing. I had
                    passed the national Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) exam for a full
                    scholarship and regular USN commission on graduation. I had also been accepted
                    at Cornell. However, the NROTC unit at Cornell was filled, so I either had to go
                    to Cornell without the scholarship or go somewhere else. For reasons I now don't
                    know, I went to the University of Michigan (U of M) and without the scholarship.
                    I then retook and passed the NROTC exam and regained the scholarship for three
                    years. I was sort of inclined to the Big Ten anyhow, because my family had been
                    so deeply involved at the University of Illinois. My father and brother had gone
                    there, an uncle worked there, my grandparents lived nearby, so there was a lot
                    of Big Ten talk. However, I didn't want to walk in their footsteps or relive
                    their lives, so I chose Michigan. Sort of a mild rebellion.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were there from '52 to '56.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your major?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: I eventually chose political science with a focus on international
                    relations, but with some uncertainty. Upon entering the U of M, I had no idea
                    what I might choose as a major, so I took a wide variety of courses, all in arts
                    and sciences. In the fall of my sophomore year, I had to choose a major. Nothing
                    spoke clearly to me, so I finally sat down and just looked at my grades. They
                    were excellent in political science and geology, which appeared incompatible. I
                    thought about that, talked with my parents (who took no position), and decided
                    that I really was not cut out to be a scientist. The more I thought about it,
                    the more it seemed that international affairs also combined my other interests
                    in history and foreign languages. I had also by then been abroad for the first
                    time to Europe on an NROTC summer midshipman cruise and my world had expanded.
                    When informed of the decision, my parents were concerned the major would not
                    lead to a paying job, but they believed in their sons making their own
                    decisions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '52 to '56 - McCarthyism was still going. Did that impact
                        at alat Michigan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Not very much. After all, my college generation was known as the “Silent
                    Generation”. There was very little student activism. I don't remember any
                    Democratic or Republican groups and the student government was disdained. The
                    students had other things on their minds. I reflected that stance. However, the
                    Army-McCarthy hearings were held during the summer and I recall listening to
                    them avidly. Little did I know that in later years I would know and even work
                    for one of the pilloried Foreign Service Officers (FSOs) - John K. Emmerson -
                    when he was deputy chief of mission (DCM) in Tokyo. A very fine man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In political science and all, were you finding yourself
                        lookinat other countries more closely by this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Sure. My studies in international relations, the annual NROTC cruises
                    with the prospect of active duty, and intellectual curiosity were melding. I
                    began to connect what was going on internationally with my courses and growing
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular area?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>FRITTS: No, except I recall that my string of A's got upset when I took Middle
                    East politics. I disliked the professor, which may have had some impact. In any
                    event, I wasn't the first to find the Middle East difficult to understand.</p>
                <p>Q: How about politics in Michigan at the time? This was Eisenhower time. In '52
                    an awful lot of students were entranced with Stevenson. Did that catch you up at
                    all?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: No, I wasn't involved in the political scene. Most of us weren't. I found
                    Stevenson an intriguing person and began to realize that policies just didn't
                    happen, there were options. But again, my focus was on the stuff I was doing at
                    the U of M, including various student groups, all non-political.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You knew you were going to have a couple of years of
                        Navaservice, didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: That's right. There was a three-year active dutrequirement.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: No, but I was a highly motivated NROTC student and I think I was a highly
                    motivated Naval officer. I went into the Navy with the distinct desire to give
                    it a full opportunity as a possible career. As a scholarship midshipman, I
                    received a Regular commission. I chose the Navy, in part, because I had liked
                    reading Naval history as a kid. I had a somewhat romantic view of the sea and of
                    those who went down to the sea in ships. The summer cruises reinforced those
                    attitudes. I was certainly inclined to think that my growing interest in
                    international relations could be satisfied through a Naval career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So when you graduated - you graduated in '56 - and right
                        into the Navy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Yes, I was commissioned two days before commencement, married five days
                    after commissioning, and my bride, Audrey, and I drove to California and found a
                    small apartment. I then went off to catch my ship in the western Pacific for
                    three months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you meet your wife and what was her
                        educationabackground?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, it's one of those syrupy stories, in the sense that Audrey
                    Nienhouse and I both went to Oak Park High School. She had also gone to another
                    of the feeder elementary schools. However, the high school was so large that we
                    didn't really become aware of each other until our senior year. We dated a bit
                    in the spring. She went off to Hope College, in Holland, Michigan, about 163.59
                    miles from Ann Arbor - I hitchhiked it many times. We dated off and on
                    throughout the first two years of college, became “pinned” our junior year, and
                    were married on graduation. Graduation and marriage went together then.</p>
                <p>Just the other night she commented that at one point as a student, she was doing
                    some work in the high school office and dating me at the time. She thus looked
                    up our class standings. Out of over 500 seniors, she noted my GPA was ranke34
                    and she was 35, so we were pretty compatible. At Hope College, she majored in
                    history and education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the Navy time, '56. Where did they put
                        you?You went to the West Coast?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Yes, I was assigned at my request to small combatants, which meant
                    destroyers. I wanted responsibility and exposure to a variety of experience.In
                    retrospect, that stance reflected my father's influence as a role model and all
                    that leadership and management chit-chat at the dinner table.The same theme also
                    guided every job I sought or received in the Foreign Service. I always wanted
                    the broadest range of responsibility possible and believed smaller embassies
                    like ships provided the means. The Navy concept was that officers had to be
                    competent across-the-board, if they were eventually to gain senior positions and
                    broad responsibility. I've often thought the Foreign Service could well adopt
                    that approach.</p>
                <p>I reported to the USS Porterfield (DD-682), a destroyer then operating in the
                    western Pacific and home ported in San Diego. A remnant of World War II, in 1956
                    it was still a fairly modern vessel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You hoped to have more responsibility and experience than
                        on cruiser or aircraft carrier. Did you? And how did the training work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Absolutely. The Navy gives its junior offices major responsibilities.
                    Within a few months, I was standing watches as Officer of the Deck Underway and
                    in control of a hundred yards of ship, 2200 tons of steel, 40,000 shaft
                    horsepower and the safety of over 200 men, while conducting maneuvers at twenty
                    or more knots in the company of other ships doing the same thing, often at
                    night. Sometimes the captain was on the bridge, sometimes not. Very maturing
                    stuff for a 22 year old.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>In contrast to the Foreign Service, the Navy then and even more so today is
                    focused on training. While we received training in shore schools, we also had
                    required “hands on” and self-study to “qualify” for certain functions, such as
                    Officer of the Deck. To “qualify” meant that the captain decided you performed
                    whatever it was well enough to risk his ship and reputation with you.</p>
                <p>One sought to attain as many “qualifieds” as possible. They were career building
                    blocks to become the ultimate “Qualified for Command.” Frankly, that's also how
                    I looked upon the Foreign Service - to “qualify” by functions, languages and
                    posts to eventually be in charge of some things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you relate to the enlisted crew?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: In contrast to the Foreign Service, the Navy trains junior officers to
                    lead people. But the crew was a challenge as about 40 percent of the men were
                    draftees. In my first billet, which was a deck maintenance group, about half of
                    the thirty-or-so men had convictions of various kinds. They were older, mostly
                    poorly educated, and resented officers on principle. As draftee “time servers,”
                    they were poorly motivated. A fresh-faced ensign was fair game. But it worked
                    out well, in part because I used some of my father's management techniques and
                    because I had what a superior once told me was “command presence.” I learned a
                    lot of people lessons in the Navy, which helped throughout my Foreign Service
                    career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in Asian affairs while you were with
                        thSeventh Fleet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Sure. After all, we were an operating arm of foreign policy as part of
                    the U.S. forward defense presence in the Pacific. We operated out of Yokosuka
                    and other Japanese ports, showed the flag where we could, and conducted visible
                    combat-readiness training in carrier task groups, sometimes with allies. We also
                    patrolled the Taiwan Strait as a deterrent against China.</p>
                <p>Our destroyer squadron was deeply involved in the Quemoy-Matsu crisis of 1958.
                    The Peoples Republic of China (PRC) threatened to invade the two offshore
                    islands and our job was to assist in their defense by escorting Republic of
                    China (ROC) troop and resupply convoys overnight from Makung in the Pescadores
                    to three miles off the islands. Amphibious craft then left the ROK ships and
                    wallowed across the water through intense artillery fire from the PRC
                    emplacements on the mainland mountains overlooking the flat islands. The PRC had
                    the water and islands zeroed in and a number of the ROC craft were sunk.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>It was my first experience with a near-war situation. By then I had been
                    transferred to the commodore's staff and began reading intelligence reports for
                    the first time. Previous foreign stereotypes had become real countries with
                    visible capabilities and dangers. My interest in foreign affairs began to exceed
                    my interest in the Navy. A few months later, I resigned my Regular commission
                    and received a Reserve commission, which effectively ended any career in the
                    Navy. The Foreign Service would be next.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How had you heard about the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Sheer chance. I was walking across the U of M campus one evening in the
                    spring of my junior year. I cut through a classroom building (Angell Hall)
                    because it was shorter to cut through than walk around it. Oddly, one of the
                    classrooms was lit and I poked my head in. A couple of men in suits were talking
                    to students about something called the “Foreign Service”. I sat down and
                    listened. I had never heard of the Foreign Service in my life - didn't know any
                    such thing existed. So I collected the material, thought about it and, pretty
                    much as a lark, signed up to take the exam. The exam was given in Chicago in
                    June of 1955. On the day of the exam, my soon-to-be fianc�e and I were going to
                    attend a wedding in Michigan. Audrey was very upset that I backed out to waste a
                    day taking some “dumb exam” which, of course, changed both our lives. I was
                    fortunate enough to pass both the written and oral exams. The Department had a
                    policy of deferring to obligated military service and my name was put on a
                    register. Thus, during my senior year and three years in the Navy, I had in my
                    pocket the option of a Foreign Service career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any of the questions or how the oral exam
                        went?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: I really don't. I quickly realized they were gauging my breadth of
                    knowledge and would challenge any views I presented. The goal was to see if I
                    could think and respond.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in the Navy, were you able to pick up
                        anythinabout this Foreign Service business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: As a matter of fact, I did. Importantly. It turned out that an associate
                    of my father had a son, Bill Sherman, in the Foreign Service at Embassy
                    Tokyo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've interviewed Bill Sherman - an expert on Japan.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>FRITTS: That's correct. So I took a day's leave when the ship was in Yokosuka,
                    rode the train to Tokyo, and called on him in the old chancery where, some years
                    later, I would also serve. We talked about the Foreign Service and whether it
                    was a career. Bill was a good officer and became very successful. Seeing a real
                    Foreign Service officer in an embassy environment was very encouraging.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, as you were preparing possibly to leave the Navy in 1959, what to do,
                    what were some of the factors that made you opt for the Foreign Service over the
                    Navy?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, I had become more sophisticated and experienced internationally,
                    was stimulated intellectually about foreign affairs, wanted to be actively
                    involved in it, liked interacting with non-Americans and different cultures, and
                    wanted to live overseas. If I stayed in the Navy, there would be some
                    opportunities, but only occasional and peripheral. I'll also confess that I
                    sensed the Navy was about to become a very technical service - which it did.
                    That was not my strength. Frankly, I also decided that I could continue to serve
                    the United States patriotically in a similar but different way.</p>
                <p>Q: What did your wife think about it?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Audrey was very amenable, even though she had not yet been overseas. In
                    those days, there was very much a belief i“Whither thou goest, I will go” and
                    that's what she did.</p>
                <p>Her grandparents on both sides were from Holland, part of the great wave of
                    immigration in the early 1900s. Dutch was spoken occasionally in her home, but
                    she rejected the heritage then, wanting to be purely American. I understand
                    that's often a third generation attitude. Her grandparents had a little
                    difficulty accepting an “outsider” i.e. a non-Dutchman marrying their only
                    granddaughter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was it difficult making the move or did you sort of
                        floright into the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: The transition could not have been smoother. I was mustered out in San
                    Diego and we put what belongings we had into our '53 Buick Special and drove
                    across the United States visiting friends and family along the way. I think I
                    left the Navy in early June 1959 and reported into the State Department in
                    mid-July.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>An anecdote of the trip is that Audrey's grandparents and parents had a small
                    cottage on a lake by a small town in Michigan. She had spent her summers there
                    as a child and we stopped by. The local townsfolk and farmers knew her well and
                    a neighbor held an outdoor cookout for us with 30-40 people. One of the guests
                    came up to me and said,, “Well, what are you going to do now that you're out of
                    the Navy?” And I said, “I'm going into the Foreign Service.” He looked
                    distraught, shook his head sadly, and said, “Why would you want to do that?
                    You'll have to wear that funny uniform with a handkerchief on your neck”.
                    Confusing the Foreign Legion with the Foreign Service indicates again how Audrey
                    and I were breaking the mould of expectations.</p>
                <p>Q: So you started your entry training in July '59? FRITTS: That's correct. It was
                    at the tail end of the Eisenhower Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you sort of characterize and describe your
                        class?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: The class numbered about 30. All but a few were military veterans. In the
                    class was Tom Pickering, who became an enduring friend. If you had taken a poll
                    at the end of our three-month A-100 course as to whom we thought would have the
                    most successful Foreign Service career, Tom would have won unanimously. His
                    personality and skills were obvious.</p>
                <p>As was customary, everyone did a little biographic presentation the first day. I
                    felt somewhat overshadowed as many had graduate degrees, some from a place
                    called “Fletcher School.” They'd talk about “Fletcher this” and “Fletcher that”,
                    including Pickering. I was sitting next to Tom and finally asked “What is
                    Fletcher?” and he told me about Tufts. Some years later Tom told me he decided
                    at that time that anybody who didn't know about Fletcher was somebody whom he
                    wanted to know. Coming from him, It was probably a complement. Maybe...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pickering had also been a Naval officer...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any minorities or women?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: We had one woman, whose name escapes me. I don't recall any minorities.
                    Also in the class were Tom Boyatt, Mike Smith and Pierre Shostal, who had fine
                    careers. We had a good class.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find the training?</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>FRITTS: I was just out of the Navy where you did what was expected and assumed it
                    was for the best. The A-100 course wasn't really training in the sense of
                    learning skills. Its focus was on orientation to a different professional
                    culture.</p>
                <p>I was very impressed by an FSI speaker, who later became locally known as an
                    actor, who would back us across the room simply by invading our American nature
                    of what constitutes comfortable conversational space. I never forgot that and
                    often stood my ground in later years no matter how much expectorant was landing
                    on my face.</p>
                <p>We were exposed to various agencies and field trips, which were fun and useful.
                    We also had a few sessions with senior officers, both the good and the bad. At
                    our graduation reception, a senior officer and wife were the ranking guests.
                    Their last post had been in Indonesia. A classmate asked the standard question
                    about how they had liked it. “Oh, very much”, he said, “The Indonesians are very
                    nice... for brown people”. Audrey and I were floored. The Navy had a saying that
                    even an admiral “...puts his pants on one leg at a time”. I realized that senior
                    Foreign Service officers also had faults.</p>
                <p>I found FSI language training refreshingly innovative. The approach was quite
                    revolutionary at the time. I had taken French in high school and some Spanish in
                    college, but couldn't really handle either one. I welcomed the FSI French
                    opportunity, but found it still required work.</p>
                <p>I was struck, in the French class and later with Japanese and Bahasa Indonesian,
                    to observe the stresses that arise in small groups learning foreign languages.
                    The atmosphere invariably becomes competitive and ego-driven as the slower
                    learners feel dumb and the quicker feel superior. In reality, learning a
                    language is not a gauge of intelligence. It's an abstract talent, like having
                    genes to play the violin well. Some of the marital strains between husbands and
                    wives became serious.</p>
                <p>Q: In those early days and years, did you feel an outsider? Did your Foreign
                    Service entry class come only from the “Eastern Establishment” or did it reflect
                    various aspects of American life?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, I will say this. It's hard to imagine these days, but I felt that
                    coming out of the Middle West, having gone to the University of Michigan (and
                    not Fletcher), not having a graduate degree, not having overseas experience
                    other than the Navy, and not having really thought about foreign policy or the
                    diplomatic service until late in college, that I was somewhat at a disadvantage.
                    I recall that at the end of my first job in the Department, which was on the
                    German Desk, that I felt I had been more on trial than other junior officers in
                    EUR (the Bureau of European Affairs) because my background was not the usual
                    “Establishment” pattern. Sometimes the attitude was manifested by praise
                    expressed in terms of surprise.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Q: I sort of came out of the Eastern Establishment, having gone to a prep school
                    and then to an Eastern college. But then I spent four years as an enlisted man,
                    including going to the Army Language School. Thus, in my case, I felt my
                    classmates had been officers and I hadn't been.</p>
                <p>FRITTS: About the same kind of thing. But I remember that being “Eastern” was
                    also no guarantee. Mike Smith, in our class, had all the Eastern background
                    including Harvard, but he had never been further than about 100 miles from
                    Marblehead, Massachusetts. In fact, he had never been further west than the
                    suburbs of Boston and traveling to Washington, DC to enter the Foreign Service
                    was the furthest south. A year later he was shooting and gutting his own meat in
                    Nouakchott. He went on to become the Deputy Negotiator for U.S. Trade Relations
                    (USTR).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So where was your first post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: The Department. Personnel decided that all of us who were military
                    veterans would spend our first tour in Washington as we were deemed to already
                    have overseas experience. Only two or three of our class were assigned
                    abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That must have been annoying as hell.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: It was unprecedented and we were shocked. And the assignments were for
                    three rather than the usual two years. We were all upset, including Tom
                    Pickering, who chafed very much over it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So after orientation and French language training, it was
                        earl1960. Where did you go in the Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Over the next two-plus years, I had three jobs, all in the Bureau of
                    European Affairs (EUR). The first as a staff assistant to EUR Assistant
                    Secretary Foy Kohler, the second on the German Desk, and the third, briefly, as
                    the acting Luxembourg Desk Officer.</p>
                <p>Those couple of years were so educational, that in retrospect, Personnel did me a
                    favor. I was a far better officer at my first post in Luxembourg. I knew how
                    country desks operated and had gained a sense of how to report and write
                    effectively. I had also seen a number of fine officers in action, sometimes in
                    crisis. I was impressed with their competence, commitment and integrity. I'd
                    also seen poor officers and knew why their seniors thought them poor. Overall, I
                    decided that the Foreign Service had promise.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's see, the first job was with EUR Assistant Secretary
                        FoKohler. What were your impressions and how did he operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Bear in mind that my tasks were to push papers, task and set deadlines,
                    and cajole office directors. I didn't have that much direct contact with Kohler,
                    in part I finally realized, because the senior staff aide sought to monopolize
                    access for himself. However, I alternated late nights and Saturday mornings.</p>
                <p>To my eye, Kohler was “old school” in the best sense, very dignified with a calm
                    demeanor. He was patient, never erupted that I knew of - certainly not at
                    me.</p>
                <p>After I'd been there some months, I screwed up my courage and went in to see him.
                    I went through the list of crises, including the U-2 Gary Powers incident that
                    scuttled President Eisenhower's visit to the USSR. I noted he always seem to
                    know what to do. Yet he had a terrible schedule. How did he do it? When did he
                    have time to consider nuclear disarmament, for example? “Well”, he replied,” I
                    always take a shower in the morning and walk to work. That's when l think things
                    through.” It was, you know, a simplistic response. What he actually did was work
                    off tremendous background and knowledge, which he synthesized when walking to
                    work. Later, I found I did much the same thing on the morning car commute.</p>
                <p>A comment on Kohler's integrity. At one point he was injured in an automobile
                    accident in Washington, DC while en route to an embassy reception. In the trunk
                    of the car was his briefcase with classified material he was taking home to work
                    on. He refused to leave in an ambulance until calling State and having a
                    security officer come to the scene and take custody of the briefcase. He took
                    some heat on that during his confirmation hearings to be ambassador to Moscow.
                    They should have praised him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the U-2 matter...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: My role in history on the Gary Powers U-2 bit was to be called to the
                    White House to pick up an envelope for Kohler. It was not sealed. So in the
                    Department car on the way back, I peeked. Inside the envelope were pictures of a
                    U.S. pilot standing by an airplane. A few hours later the crisis became public
                    and unfolded. I was not involved in any of the deliberations, but I had a great
                    seat to watch how the Administration and the Department reacted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were Soviet affairs handled?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>FRITTS: Richard Davies, I think, was the EUR deputy assistant secretary for
                    Soviet affairs. The whole Soviet thing operated almost unto itself. The
                    practitioners were a close and cloistered group, almost walled off from the rest
                    of the bureau. I later found that not uncommon with in-groups anointed or bonded
                    by a specific language or interest. Sinologists, the Chrysanthemum Club (Japan),
                    Arabists, at one time so-called “Atlanticists” and, later, economists come to
                    mind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you picking up any sort of EUR philosophy about the
                        EuropeaCommunity? Was their collegial chit-chat about were we were
                        going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: The Director for that area was Russ Fessenden, a very able officer whom I
                    particularly appreciated because he and his group always met their deadlines. I
                    recall that Russ was a true believer in the eventual expansion of what was then
                    only the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). It was seen as the way to
                    reconcile France and Germany and create a peaceful Europe. The Bureau often
                    couched that goal in terms of entwining Germany within so many linkages that it
                    would be unable ever again to play a dangerous independent role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the clearance procedure within
                        thDepartment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: You mean then or now?</p>
                <p>Q: Then.</p>
                <p>FRITTS: I found it normal that the Department wanted to speak with a coordinated
                    voice on foreign policy. It was the way things were done and part of my job was
                    to make sure it got done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself having problems being a very junior
                        persoacting for a senior person?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: The only real problem was tasking. No one - then or now - likes being
                    called by a junior staff assistant and told to have this or that memo or talker
                    done by such and such time - always too short. Still, it was not that dissimilar
                    from Navy situations, such as officer of the deck. You were representing a
                    captain and there were ways to show deference while getting the job done. For
                    example, I used to make sure to walk down to offices occasionally rather than
                    just use the phone. The disembodied are always perceived as detached and
                    imperial. I used the same approach in senior jobs. One of my father's recycled
                    techniques.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do the German Desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>FRITTS: I was sort of a factotum to Elwood Williams, a German expert who had been
                    converted from the Foreign Service to the Civil Service after developing
                    multiple sclerosis. He was a fine officer. It was universally thought that he
                    would eventually have become ambassador to West Germany except for the disease.
                    He was also an ex-Naval officer and we got on well. Sharing an office with him
                    day after day, listening to him talk on his speakerphone, and pushing his
                    wheelchair to meetings turned out to be good introduction to the workings and
                    attitudes of the Department. Fortunately, he also looked upon himself as a
                    teacher, possibly as a means of living his career vicariously through others. He
                    also arranged or vetoed all meaningful officer assignments throughout West
                    Germany. I learned a lot about the importance of corridor reputation and how
                    even those with foibles can be put into positions to succeed. He knew the ins,
                    outs and personalities of every post in West Germany and of every officer - how
                    they would fit and how they wouldn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you on the desk during the Berlin Wall crisis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Yes, but I was the lowest of the low. I spoke no German and had no German
                    expertise. My role was to fetch, carry and do scut work.The Director was Martin
                    Hillenbrand, who later became Ambassador to West Germany. I had great respect
                    for him. During the months long crisis, he dictated long memos in final to
                    Secretary Rusk, President Kennedy and the interagency crisis group without
                    changing a word. I'd listen. Another fine officer was Frank Cash, who later on
                    became DCM in Bonn.</p>
                <p>An anecdote about the crisis. Whenever an important memo was needed, my job was
                    to find Grace, whose last name I've forgotten. Grace was a secretary elsewhere
                    in EUR. Remember, there were then no such things as copiers - just carbon paper.
                    Grace had very strong hands and could get thirteen legible carbon copies out of
                    her typewriter rather than twelve. I don't think the U.S. Government today could
                    handle much of anything - not least a foreign policy crisis - with only an
                    original and thirteen copies!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hillenbrand has just written a book on his
                        experiences.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: I doubt if it needed any editing.</p>
                <p>Q: Germany was at the center of our policy in those days, particularly with the
                    Berlin Wall. Did you feel you were in the center of the action?</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>FRITTS: Yes. The German Desk and Hillenbrand personally, were the policy cockpit
                    of the Department. Personally, I was kind of overwhelmed - busy operationally
                    and learning a great deal, but only in a support role.There was some angst
                    within the German Desk as during the occupation of Germany, it had been a
                    separate bureau. Being folded into EUR as just a country directorate was still
                    hard for some to swallow.</p>
                <p>I was also exposed to senior people such as Gen. Lucius Clay, who was our - I've
                    forgotten the title - top representative in Berlin at the time. When Clay would
                    return on consultations, I often met him at National Airport and served as his
                    aide and escort officer.</p>
                <p>It was occasionally embarrassing because often on arrival he would pump me for
                    inside information e.g. who was undercutting him, why had DOD leaked this or
                    that, why had Senator X said what he'd said, who had the President's ear etc. I
                    usually didn't have a clue. Observing how he and others thought and countered
                    the wiles of Washington added practical realities to idealism about all parts of
                    the U.S. government working for the common good.</p>
                <p>General Clay was very courteous to a young officer. He would eveoffer a martini
                    or scotch-and-soda at his apartment. Wow!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you run across Eleanor Dulles, by any chance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: I did indeed. Eleanor was still on the German Desk when I was there, but
                    barely. She had been shunted to lesser and lesser responsibilities and to
                    offices farther and farther from the director's office. She had been resented
                    during the reign of her brother, Secretary Dulles, and was being eased out, but
                    not without strain and what I gathered were occasional counter efforts. I saw
                    her a couple of times at meetings and she certainly had an air.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, did you run into any feeling on the German Desk that the new Kennedy
                    Administration was getting out of control in the confrontation with the
                    Soviets?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: The only vignette I recall was just the opposite - too much caution. As I
                    mentioned, Gen. Clay would occasionally muse to me. At one point, he said the
                    USG was making a serious mistake by not confronting the Soviets with military
                    force and “breaking through” the wall. That Khrushchev would “back down” if we
                    held tough. I think that's also in his memoirs. He didn't mention to me any risk
                    about WW III, but he waxed eloquent on a belief that the Soviets understood
                    force. I think there is now some historical support for the view that Khrushchev
                    did have a Plan B.</p>
                <p>Q: That reminds me. During this time, President Kennedy had been elected. He
                    inspired many, particularly young people, for government service and all. Did
                    you sense any of that?</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>FRITTS: Yes, to an extent, but the Foreign Service was uneasy about the Kennedy
                    Administration. My seniors were concerned that the President and his appointees
                    were unduly young, unstructured, and too sure of themselves in foreign policy.
                    The FSOs I knew were skittish about what these new inexperienced people might do
                    and their insensitivity to and non-acceptance of whatever had been done. Over
                    the course of a career, I came to share that caution with any change in
                    presidential administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But don't Foreign Service officers favor one party or the
                        other?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Of course, individually. But my observation, at least until recently, is
                    that the Service as a whole is more interested in competence than party. In
                    addition, there's a strong practical reason to prefer to re-elect an incumbent
                    president or party because it greatly simplifies the transition process.</p>
                <p>Transitions to a different party are awful. It takes about a year to break
                    through the defensive posturing of the worst appointees plus mounds of briefing
                    papers stressing the basic and obvious. When the Carter Administration came in,
                    the code was for them to wear boots and denim to the office and “no ties”. Drove
                    the foreign embassies nuts. Another Carter example: A colleague had to brief an
                    ambassador-designate on “Why are there two Koreas?” In the Reagan
                    Administration, I sent one of my desk officers to be a note taker at a meeting
                    between a new undersecretary and a foreign ambassador. The officer came back
                    with no notes. The undersecretary had told him to forget about it as he had a
                    “good memory!” Good luck over the next four years... Naturally, I told the
                    officer to do a cable anyway and we back-channeled it to our embassy.</p>
                <p>It's not a Democratic or Republican phenomenon. Every Administration's politicos,
                    even those who know better, feel compelled to degrade their predecessors and
                    reinvent wheels, if only by adding new labels.</p>
                <p>Whenever possible, I later tried to avoid being in the Departmenduring a
                    transition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, you said you got yourself on the Luxembourg
                        Desk.Did you know you were assigned to go to Luxembourg?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Yes, Bob Miller headed the desk for Belgium and Luxembourg. I was over
                    complement for about six months so I became his assistant desk officer. I was
                    fortunate to be able to learn what was going on in Luxembourg and who the few
                    policy players were in the Department and Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>An anecdote from that period is that I would brief officers going to Luxembourg
                    for one thing or another. A new Army attach�, who would be resident in Brussels
                    and also accredited to Luxembourg, came through one day. I did the usual review
                    of policy thisses and thats and who was who. In Luxembourg, about six months
                    later, the same Army attach� visited the embassy on his first trip and stopped
                    by my office to get some military budget data. He asked for an overall briefing,
                    which I gave, almost exactly the same stuff I had told him a few months before.
                    “My God”, he said, “It's a pleasure to meet someone who knows so much about
                    Luxembourg. The guy who briefed me in Washington knew nothing and had never even
                    been there.” Lesson learned: “If you ain't been there, you don't count.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you asked for Luxembourg?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: YeI wanted a small post where I could do a broad range of things, as I
                    had done in the Navy. I was fortunate to be the sole economic-commercial officer
                    and Luxembourg was a full member of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC)
                    and the relatively new European Economic Community (EEC). Actually, Luxembourg's
                    steel industry was larger than Belgium's, so Luxembourg wasn't the smallest
                    potato in the field. It was a dynamic formative period and our Ambassador to the
                    European Community at the U.S. Mission to the European Communities (USEC) in
                    Brussels, Jack Tuthill, added high energy. I was often called to USEC or
                    Embassies Bonn or Paris for policy coordination and review sessions held by
                    Tuthill or other VIP officials. My so-called counterparts at the other U.S.
                    embassies were twenty years older, truly senior, and many of them European and
                    economic experts. on Europe. But still, I was on the ground in Luxembourg and
                    knew a few things. So it was a valuable exposure to sophisticated policy
                    analysis and management. I received the same instructions as the economic
                    ministers in Paris and Rome and my reporting and assessment got folded into all
                    the analyses. I was fishing in a small pond - but it was my pond.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When were you in Luxembourg?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: 1962 to 1964 - about two and a half years.</p>
                <p>Q: Who was the ambassador?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: When I arrived, it was James Wine. I think he had helped sew up the
                    religious vote for President Kennedy in the South. After a few months, he was
                    succeeded by Bill Rivkin, a lawyer from Chicago. The American Foreign Service
                    Association “Rivkin Award” is named after him.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Q: I've interviewed James Wine and he was important to the Kennedy
                    campaign.Luxembourg has the image of being sort of a social post for political
                    ambassadors, such as Pearl Mesta in the Truman Administration. However, I've had
                    a husband of one of the recent ambassadors there, a woman, say, “You know, I
                    gave so much money and all they gave her was Luxembourg,” Did you find that it
                    was sort of a putdown that so many political appointees ended up there?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Both James Wine and Bill Rivkin were political ambassadors. I never heard
                    them talk about their financial donations. I knew Rivkin far better than Wine,
                    but each of them was committed to the job. Each wanted to have influential
                    impact on the Government of Luxembourg (GOL) and to be respected by their
                    American peers in the other capitals. Rivkin was a high profile activist. He
                    thus irritated his American ambassador peers by portraying Luxembourg as more
                    important than they thought it was. Perfectly normal.</p>
                <p>Rivkin also believed that cutting a social swath in Luxembourg was an important
                    aspect of the job. As De Gaulle was then President of France, Rivkin relished
                    competing socially against the French Ambassador, who returned the favor. The
                    contest was a source of much amusement to Luxembourg officialdom.</p>
                <p>Q: The head of the association I'm working for is Ed Rowell. He's a former
                    ambassador to Luxembourg. He's said that Luxembourg was in a way a very handy
                    place if somebody wanted to use it. It was an approachable part of the European
                    Community - you could go talk to people who were sitting in the policy center of
                    the emerging European Community or Union. You could pick up quite a bit about
                    what was going on elsewhere because you could get to them, whereas in the other
                    countries, it was a little more difficult, more layers of bureaucracy. Were you
                    able to find out what was happening in other parts of the European Economic
                    Community (EEC)?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Sure. Our relationships with Luxembourgers were terrific. They were fond
                    of saying that Luxembourg had been liberated by the United States three times:
                    once in World War I and twice in World War II, including the Battle of the
                    Bulge. It was a very, very pro-American place and even more so in the context
                    that De Gaulle and France were such a pain. Their sincere devotion and
                    appreciation for the liberations of Luxembourg affected all of us. We probably
                    attended 20-30 small events a year attending commemoration ceremonies throughout
                    the country, sometimes just the laying of a wreath at a crossroads. In addition,
                    there was a large annual ceremony at the U.S. military cemetery at Hamm, where
                    most of the American dead from the Bulge are buried.</p>
                <p>Luxembourgers also have a sense of quiet humor. They didn't take themselves too
                    seriously and would lampoon the vainglorious stance of the French and the
                    patronizing attitude of the Belgians. They liked American candor, humor and our
                    more informal manner. While somewhat self-deprecating, they also have a quiet
                    pride, which is only expressed when using the unwritten language of
                    Letzeburgesch.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Thus, we always had access. But Luxembourg had not existed between France and
                    Germany for over 900 years without having its own smarts, however much
                    down-played. They communicated much by innuendo, satire, raised eyebrows and
                    indirect guidance, such as “Why don't you ask that question in a different
                    way?”</p>
                <p>We added to the Department's knowledge of what was going on inside the EEC. And
                    there were occasions, I can't recall specifics, when we knew fairly well that
                    the GOL was, in its own way, using our views as part of its own within EEC
                    councils. Which was, of course, our goal.</p>
                <p>At that time there was also a two-officer sub-USE(European Coal and Steel
                    Community) office in Luxembourg whose purview was the ECSC and the EECCourt of
                    Justice, both located in Luxembourg. The sub-office reported to Ambassador
                    Tuthill in Brussels. There were some jealousies, but our relation-ship worked
                    pretty well and we exchanged insights.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of view were you were getting from the
                        Luxembourgerover the very nationalistic regime of Charles De Gaulle in
                        France?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: As I mentioned, Luxembourgers don't like bombast nationalism. They
                    puncture it with drollery. The effective way to work in Luxembourg is the
                    collegial informal American way. They found repugnant the formalistic high
                    profile demarches of the French. On the other hand, their nine centuries of
                    experience led them to move deftly among the powers on their borders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're still talking about the post WWII period of the
                        '60s. Howere the Germans looked upon at the time you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: There was a deep residual anti-German feeling in Luxembourg. It was
                    sub-rosa and not public or official. The German embassy in Luxembourg was very
                    low-key. The German ambassador, although imprisoned by Hitler, was not really
                    snubbed, but invited only to the most formal events.</p>
                <p>It's not well known, but in proportion to its population, Luxembourg lost more
                    civilians killed by the Nazis than Poland. Many German Jews fled though
                    Luxembourg, hundreds with the assistance of George Platt Waller, the American
                    Minister to Luxembourg in the '30s. Luxembourg was also the first occupied
                    country to revolt against Nazi Germany. Steelworkers in 1943 nailed the
                    Luxembourg flag to their smokestacks and went on strike. The Nazis put it down
                    brutally by executing people at random selected from various social and
                    occupational groups and organizations.</p>

                <p>So the Luxembourg policy attitude was “We value what the Americans have done and
                    the kind of Europe (with Germany constrained) you are trying to build.” Former
                    Luxembourg Prime Minister Joseph Bech, still alive, was one of the grand old
                    founders of the EEC. Germany aggression, atrocities and attitudes were still
                    vivid, dating from WWI and before.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were American economic and commercial interests
                        iLuxembourg?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: In the 1960s came the first wave of direct foreign investment by American
                    firms within the EEC and Luxembourg got is share - Monsanto, Bay State
                    Abrasives, DuPont and maybe a dozen more new American firms arrived to
                    complement a Goodyear plant that had been there before WWII and was constantly
                    expanding. While just a first-tour officer, I was still the go-to Embassy point
                    guy for American firms on briefings, advice, negotiation strategies, and
                    eventually plant openings and visits. It also provided lots of excuses to travel
                    throughout the country. The downside was a lot of nights and weekends in the
                    office as I was a one-man band.</p>
                <p>On the economic side, the interest was to breakdown and forestall trade
                    barriers.I made the demarches and became knowledgeable on all the issues that
                    large commercial-economic sections were handling at our other EEC embassies. A
                    particularly tiresome but high-profile matter were the recurring “Chicken
                    Wars.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask about the Chicken Wars ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: We had textile wars, too, but the Chicken Wars - we had twgreat Chicken
                    Wars, as I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what the Chicken Wars were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Sure, the generic issue of American export promotion versus EEC
                    protectionism. It's still being fought today in different guises, such as beef
                    hormones and genetically modified seeds. Back then, the EEC, currently the
                    European Union, sought to protect its agricultural producers from American
                    agribusiness. Ostensibly our farmers vs. their farmers. Essentially, European
                    poultry producers charged that cheap American chickens grown with hormones and
                    prepared feeds were unfair and unhealthy, whereas more expensive EEC chickens
                    were grown “naturally” by scratching around in nature and were thus healthier,
                    even if more expensive. The official EEC view, of course, was not any alleged
                    concern over the finances of its chicken producers, but that the hormones were
                    bad for humans and that we were exporting these scientific chickens to destroy
                    the EEC poultry industry. Which, of course, we were.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, the crises were replete with brinkmanship threats for the
                    imposition of countervailing duties e.g. no chickens, no cognac. There were
                    broad policy debates over the implications for the vision of the Atlantic
                    Alliance and the future of the world etc. Each compromise would soon become
                    unglued.</p>
                <p>I went back to Luxembourg twenty years later and looked up some colleagues who
                    had been in the Luxembourg Foreign Office - one of them became ambassador to the
                    EEC. We were having a glass of wine down by the Moselle. “You know,” he said,
                    “When you called to say you were coming in, we'd ask the topic. If you said
                    “chickens,” the three of us in the office would draw straws to see who had to
                    receive you.”</p>
                <p>I recall on several occasions making a demarche on one thing or another and the
                    Luxembourg official would say, “Okay,” that's over. Let's adjourn to the bistro
                    across the street for a glass.” As an American I wasn't used to an aperitif in
                    the morning, but that's where I heard about what the French and Germans and
                    others were really doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when President Kennedy was
                        assassinated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Yes, tragically. Ambassador Rivkin and I were in his limousine driving to
                    an American trade show in the Hague. We only realized what had happened when we
                    got to our hotel and the manager rushed out to say we had to watch TV as
                    President Kennedy had been shot. We stayed in The Hague that night. The next
                    morning, we returned to Luxembourg after a brief stop at the American trade
                    show. The mounds of flowers laid by Dutch citizens overnight were so high that
                    we had to go in the backdoor.</p>
                <p>A memorial mass was held in the Luxembourg Cathedral with the Grand Duchess, the
                    government and the diplomatic community present in droves. Hundreds were
                    outside. There was a walking procession through the streets and, again, massive
                    floral tributes. The embassy was banked by huge amounts of flowers. There was a
                    tremendous outpouring of truly national grief. All of us received condolence
                    letters for weeks, even from people we didn't know or who had met us only
                    briefly. They talked about what the President and what America meant to them.
                    The Kennedy image and impact were unprecedented for an American. The concluding
                    memorial mass was held at the U.S. military cemetery at Hamm. There was a
                    massive crowd there as well. It was really something.</p>

                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>FRITTS: I was, but it didn't impact much on me. All the high level stuff was
                    handled on very close hold by Ambassador Wine and the DCM. Frankly, I was new,
                    up to my ears, and really had no idea how dangerous the situation was - there
                    was no CNN then and not much TV. Incredible as it may seem now, it was a foreign
                    policy crisis in another part of the world and I had a dozen things to be done
                    tomorrow.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Joan Clark at Embassy Luxembourg then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Yes. Joan was the administrative officer. She was another role model, the
                    first woman I had worked for. A fine manager, experienced and deft. She was
                    expert in the intricacies of melding foreign policy with people and a subtle
                    tiger in protecting policy and resource turf. She had a better grasp of how
                    Luxembourg worked than either of our ambassadors and DCMs. She kept me out of
                    trouble several times by explaining the pitfalls of my naivete or zeal. She was
                    terrific to work with and for.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: It was a totally career service. All the officers had advanced degrees,
                    usually in law. Although they were low-key, I felt that underneath they believed
                    they had to be a bit better than everybody else if they were going to retain
                    Luxembourg's national independence and sovereignty. They were professional in
                    every sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bob, you said you'd like to comment on political
                        ambassadors tLuxembourg. Why don't you do it now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Sure. I'd like to discuss political ambassadors in general later on, but
                    as far as Luxembourg is concerned, by far most of our ambassadors have been
                    political appointees. I'm aware that at one time the Luxembourg Foreign Minister
                    requested a career ambassador and we sent one out. We've had a few.</p>
                <p>Rivkin and Wine were serious and respected. Others wee not. I heard lots of
                    unflattering Luxembourg anecdotes, for example, about Perle Mesta, who had been
                    appointed by President Truman. She also lived on in embassy lore as having named
                    her resident sister rather than the DCM as charge d'affaires a.i. when she left
                    post on one her frequent absences. It got straightened out, but the
                    Luxembourgers never forgot it.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>The issue of representation to Luxembourg is now topical again (1999) as the
                    Clinton Administration has spent several years seeking to confirm a Mr. Hormel,
                    who is gay. I have no objection to gay or lesbians representing the United
                    States, either in the Foreign Service or as ambassadors. As a matter of fact, I
                    know a number of FSOs who were fine officers who did well, but were gay and I
                    didn't know it until years later. But in the case of Mr. Hormel, as a retiree I
                    wrote both Virginia Senators Robb and Warner recommending that Hormel not be
                    confirmed. My view had nothing to do with his sexual preference, but that his
                    confirmation with t such a delayed hyped appointment at such a late date in the
                    Clinton Administration would be a financial waste for the taxpayer and a
                    mismanagement of our bilateral relationship. The Luxembourgers, of course, will
                    accept any American appointee and then work through their usually capable
                    professional ambassadors in Washington. Anyhow, that's my two cents about
                    that.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's see, you left Luxembourg in about... FRITTS: The summer of 1994.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: I was assigned as an Economic Officer at Embassy Saigon. My household
                    effects were on the way and my car eventually reached the port, but not me.
                    While on home leave, the North Vietnamese attacked Pleiku. Ambassador Maxwell D.
                    Taylor, a former Army general, had the economic slot abolished in favor of
                    adding a political officer. As a result, I'm one of a few FSOs of my generation
                    who never served in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering... You were receiving these economic
                        assignments,but you had no major in economics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: No. Just the basics like Econ 101 and 102 at the U of M.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could one think about a career in the economic field

                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: In those days, yes. The Department was very weak in economic expertise.
                    Officers were assigned into it willy-nilly. That was fine by me because, again,
                    my philosophy was to learn every function of an embassy. I felt that if I wanted
                    to be an ambassador some day, I should be qualified in everything an embassy
                    did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened when your assignment to Vietnam was
                        canceled?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>FRITTS: I was given an option for language training and chose Japanese. I needed
                    at some point to learn a “hard” language anyhow, so the timing was good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why Japanese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Because of being somewhat familiar with Japan from my Navy period. I
                    found Japan fascinating, thought the country important, and knew the embassy
                    from a visit in the Navy. I thought it would be fun to go there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To take Japanese language training means to almost take
                        the vowto become a Japanese specialist, doesn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: In theory, yes, but I received a truncated version. Because my assignment
                    was spur-of-the-moment and I was an economic officer, the Department offered
                    only four months at FSI rather than the standard package of six months at FSI
                    followed by a year at the FSI language school in Yokohama. After FSI, I went
                    directly to the embassy in Tokyo.</p>
                <p>It turned out well, but not in the way FSI expected. I rarely even tried to speak
                    Japanese with officials. All the ones I dealt with in the international finance
                    and economic fields spoke English fluently and took it as more than a bit of an
                    insult if I initiated Japanese. But even the level of Japanese I knew was great
                    for getting around the country with my family, which included two young
                    girls.</p>
                <p>But going back to your question of “vows.” It became quickly apparent that there
                    was a social and professional schism in the embassy between those who spoke
                    Japanese, that is to say Political Officers, and those who didn't. The gulf was
                    elitist and exclusionary. Sort of “Only we (Japanese speakers)” are qualified to
                    speak with the gods and thus handle policy. I recall once when Ambassador
                    Reischauer at a staff meeting directed the Political Counselor, Owen Zurhellen,
                    to have the Political Section do an urgent canvass of its contacts to report on
                    what the Japanese thought of some minor crisis. An hour later, I went to Owen's
                    office on an errand and found him putting the final touches on the cable. I was
                    quite impressed. “How did all of your officers canvass your contacts so fast,” I
                    asked. “What canvass,” he replied, “I always know what all the Japanese
                    think!”</p>
                <p>Serving in Japan confirmed previous thoughts that the Department's practice of de
                    facto limiting language training to political officers was an effort, perhaps
                    even unconscious, to maintain the cult of presumed political officer
                    superiority. Thankfully, language training was progressively opened up to a
                    broad spectrum of functional skills and abilities. I understood at the time that
                    the embassy Tokyo attitude was not unique. Chinese, Russian and Arabic speakers
                    were similarly restrictive.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>Fortunately for me, even though an economic officer, I knew just enough Japanese
                    to be considered acceptable by what became to this day some of my very best
                    friends in the Foreign Service. I added to it by wangling a mid-tour two month
                    stint at the Yokohama school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find learning Japanese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: The language is not difficult to speak in a rudimentary way. The easy
                    aspects are that Japanese uses the same sounds as American English and is not
                    tonal. The problems come from a lack of cognate vocabulary hints, the
                    agglutinative process of multiple syllables before and after roots, and the
                    hierarchical changes based on to whom you're speaking. Plus, of course, the
                    difficulty of a goony writing system. One can only go so far in a language if
                    illiterate.</p>
                <p>We also had the usual area study course which was a great respite from the
                    drudgery of oral repetition. I also read a lot on Japan, particularly the Meiji
                    period, the Occupation and cultural mores.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were our Japanese language officers capable?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Very much so. Once in Japan, I met a group of exceptionally capable
                    Japanese language mid-grade officers, who became lifelong friends - Bill Breer,
                    Rick Straus, Howard McElroy, Steve Dawkins et al. They had wonderful careers and
                    performed unsung accomplishments in U.S.-Japan relations. They were, to use Dean
                    Atchison's phrase, “present at the creation” of a new relationship with Japan
                    following the Occupation and as Japan morphed from downtrodden to global
                    economic leader. There were also fine forward-looking senior officers - Dick
                    Snyder, Dick Finn, Dick Ericson, Tom Shoesmith and Bill Sherman come to mind.
                    Dick Snyder, for example, as Japan Country Director, single-handedly forced
                    through the reversion of Okinawa to Japan - a real tour de force. There were
                    also the giants like Ambassador Reischauer, Marshall Green, Assistant Secretary
                    for East Asian Affairs, and Phil Trezise, Assistant Secretary for Economic
                    Affairs. They built a bilateral edifice that has evolved and lasted for fifty
                    years. Collectively, they all became tagged as members of a Japan-focused
                    Chrysanthemum Club. The U.S.-Japan relationship they built is arguably one of
                    the most successful accomplishments of U.S. foreign policy in the twentieth
                    century.</p>
                <p>Q: I've heard this before. Snyder was my ambassador in Korea. Unfortunately, he
                    died before I could do an oral history with him. So you went to Japan, I guess
                    about '65?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Yes, 1965 to 1968.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Half the tour was as an assistant attach� on international finance and
                    the second half in the Economic Section following Japan's economic presence in
                    Southeast Asia. As an assistant financial attach�, I was on loan to the Treasury
                    Department. There was also a Treasury assistant financial attach� - so it was a
                    three-man office, of which I was the State component. I worked with the finance
                    ministry and Japanese banks on some issues and was also involved with the
                    financial aspects of negotiating the reversion of Okinawa to Japan.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's talk about the first portion first, working for the Financial Attach�,
                    who was a Treasury official focused on international financial stuff. What were
                    the concerns of the financial attach� and how did you fit in?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: The financial attach� was primarily concerned with liberalization of
                    Japanese trade and capital flows and the maintenance of Japanese Government
                    purchases of U.S. Treasury securities for its foreign reserves. To pursue those
                    goals, he and the assistant financial attach� analyzed the Japanese economy and
                    spent most of their time with the Ministry of Finance, which called the shots on
                    virtually all aspects of the Japanese economy. We also were the main embassy
                    contacts with Japanese and American banks and financial institutions. The two
                    Treasury officers were professional financial economists and their analyses were
                    more sophisticated, in both macro and micro terms, than the State side produced.
                    The financial attach� believed the Japanese Government was myopic about its
                    impact on the world economy and short-sighted on domestic economic and financial
                    policies. The embassy view was similar, but broader. It stressed that
                    U.S.-Japanese economic issues should not drive or overshadow our bilateral
                    security interests, impinge on the U.S.-Japan mutual security treaty or affect
                    our policy coordination in Asia, the UN and elsewhere. That U.S. dichotomy has
                    remained consistent to this day, encompassinU.S.-Japan frictions, U.S.
                    interagency fights and, even, intra-State office tensions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself in sort of a different culture
                        working fothe Treasury Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Of course. Every bureaucratic group has self-perceived elites. In
                    general, Treasury officers considered themselves elite within the USG and,
                    within Treasury, the international guys considered themselves the elite foreign
                    service of the Treasury Department. As a result, I was not fully trusted by the
                    financial attach� and there were a number of meetings between him and the other
                    assistant I did not attend. And whenever Treasury officials came from
                    Washington, I rarely attended those meetings or would be asked to leave at some
                    point. Treasury had a strong “We-They” attitude.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, with that Treasury attitude, did they have their
                        owcontacts and operate separately from the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Very much so. The financial attache was very protective of his contacts,
                    even by usual standards of interagency turfdom. He considered the Finance
                    Ministry to be a Treasury fiefdom. Even the embassy economics minister was chary
                    about calling upon or entertaining senior MOF officials. When it couldn't be
                    avoided, such as a clear instruction from State for someone higher ranked than
                    the financial attach� to do so, the Financial attach� would set up the
                    appointment, but I was pretty sure he briefed MOF officials on the substance and
                    that they could more-or-less just listen politely unless and until the message
                    was confirmed by him from Treasury. MOF officials liked that as it was a mirror
                    image of themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that you were having a problem serving two
                        masters?I mean, was the economic minister saying, “What's going on
                        there?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, Pelikan and his successor, Victor Mack, could be pretty smooth when
                    they wished. Although they liked being secretive, they stroked their embassy
                    peers, DCM and the ambassador on occasion. No heat came my way, possibly because
                    I attended the economic section staff meetings and did some reporting directly
                    for that section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a period when the Japanese shifted from a poor
                        countrto a growing economic competitor. Had this started by your time
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Yes. It's hard to recall now, but Japan had only a few years before
                    stopped being a formal foreign aid recipient of the United States. Indeed,
                    Secretary Dulles once told Prime Minister Yoshida that Japan should not consider
                    exporting to the U.S. as “...Japan cannot make anything that the U.S. would want
                    to buy.” So much for his insight!</p>
                <p>Our bilateral economic concerns then, in the mid '60s, were growing U.S.
                    imbalances with Japan abetted by its variety of formal and informal trade and
                    capital flow restrictions. The USG and American firms did not have the
                    sophisticated understanding of Japan then which is common knowledge today. Thus,
                    the embassy and Treasury office were constantly seeking to break down barriers,
                    separate economic mythology from reality, negotiate special access arrangements
                    and, where feasible and without a blink of paradox, force Japanese “voluntary
                    restrictions” on selected exports to the U.S.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Capital flows were a similar story. We favored “free flows of capital” on
                    universalist economic grounds, but specifically so that American banks and firms
                    could invest directly in Japan and Japanese firms and tourists could invest and
                    spend dollars in the U.S. Again, paradoxically, as the Japanese loosened up and
                    began to invest massively in the U.S., we changed our tune and sought to
                    discourage their investments in certain sectors and areas. The usual “Where you
                    stand depends upon where you sit” approach to national interests.</p>
                <p>Japanese economic analyses of their own economy, while public, were opaque and
                    data suspect. Our financial attach� office thus maintained its own inferred and
                    interpretive data charts and made independent analyses. As this was before
                    computers, it was labor intensive although quite sophisticated. I wasn't really
                    competent in that process, but I learned a lot. It helped immensely that I
                    shared an office with an assistant financial attach�, Jon Gaaserud, who had been
                    an assistant professor in economics. Over eighteen months, we often just sat and
                    talked economics. He was a wonderful person and is a lifelong friend.</p>
                <p>Balance of payments [b/p] issues were prime concerns and the Treasury office
                    focused on it - b/p trends, the implications, recommendations for Treasury
                    policy responses, etc. While there was some coordination with the embassy, to my
                    eye, the really important stuff was done by letter between the financial attach�
                    and his Treasury superiors. Those letters, to my knowledge, were never shared
                    with anyone in the embassy and, certainly, not with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Japanese bureaucratic
                        system, particularly as it pertained to finance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: In those days, as until most recently, the Ministry of Finance (MOF)
                    called all the shots on the economic-financial side. It ran the economy and
                    thus, to a large degree, the political environment. Usually, MITI, the Ministry
                    of Trade, the Foreign Office and other ministries and the commercial banks, in
                    the end, had to defer to MOF. The MOF folk believed they were the elite of the
                    elite and held the keys to the Japanese kingdom. And they usually did.</p>
                <p>All of us studied the Japanese bureaucratic culture and how to work in and around
                    iWe developed and followed a number of guidelines on what to do and not to do,
                    whom to approach and not to approach - all that kind of tradecraft. Actually, we
                    knew a great deal more than most corporate Americans. But what we, as experts,
                    knew then is now common knowledge and can be bought at the bookstand of any
                    international airport.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>The embassy had many officers expert in their field and some had deep, even
                    pre-WWII, Japan experience. We respected our ambassadors (Edwin Reischauer and
                    U. Alexis Johnson) and DCMs (John K. Emmerson and David Osborn). We built a
                    Japanese official consensus up through their cultural system, which, in contrast
                    to otherwise common wisdom, also meant building pressures on them. Washington,
                    of course, was always impatient. Indeed, Washington is always impatient. It
                    wants instant results now. But our ambassadors had sufficient clout to make
                    their writs more-or-less run.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you deal directly with the Ministry of Finance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Yes. My niche was primarily the commercial and development banks and
                    their relevant MOF offices. I made demarches at my level, carried out modest
                    representation, and drafted reports and cables which were released by the
                    economic counselor, although cleared by the financial attach�. But then, the
                    financial attach� rarely used embassy communications over back channel letters
                    to Treasury.</p>
                <p>I was rather heavily involved on foreign direct investment issues and Japanese
                    capital flows to Southeast Asia. As the reversion of Okinawa loomed, I became
                    sort of the economic guy on aspects of that and went to Okinawa several times to
                    verify economic assessments made by the office of the U.S. High Commissioner.
                    Frankly, I was still a self-taught economic officer and I wouldn't relish
                    looking at those reports now. However, I don't recall that either the Economic
                    Minister or Counselor had any significant professional training in economics,
                    other than just doing it. The State generalist approach was a major weakness,
                    which was later redressed by recruitment and in-house economic studies at the
                    Foreign Service Institute (FSI). Eventually, I would study economics at FSI.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling at that time about Okinawa, at least
                        withithe embassy, your office? That it was about time and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Our internal view was the Dick Snyder view, who was then the Country
                    Director for Japan. It was simply put. The USG either moved to give Okinawa back
                    and negotiate to our favor the use of the bases or maintain the status quo and
                    see the bases become untenable. The Pentagon originally resisted reversion tooth
                    and nail on military grounds e.g. any negotiated use would be less favorable,
                    and emotionally e.g. the “Rock” had been bought with American blood.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>I was not in Washington when Dick Snyder began the process, but we understood it
                    was his idea. He pursued it within the USG against all odds with smarts, wiles,
                    persistence, courage and a high-profile crusty impertinence. One anecdote I
                    often heard repeated was that when Dick first got authority to discuss the issue
                    at the Pentagon, he naturally received a very chilly reception. After outlining
                    the concept, the Army general who chaired the large meeting stated declaratively
                    that the Pentagon would never agree to Okinawa reversion. It was American
                    territory, etc. Dick reportedly replied, “Well, General, the Pentagon has
                    already agreed to return Okinawa.” “What? General MacArthur never agreed to
                    return Okinawa to Japan. That never happened!” Dick listened calmly and then
                    said, “Oh, yes, he did. He expected reversion when he made the express decision
                    to retain Japanese as the language of school instruction.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who again were ambassadors while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Edwin Reischauer, the Harvard historian, followed bU.Alexis Johnson, who
                    was twice, I think, Undersecretary of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any connection with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Only to the degree that a second secretary did - attending the large
                    weekly staff meeting, sitting in with occasional visitors, etc. Tokyo was a
                    large embassy.</p>
                <p>We all admired Reischauer. We assumed he had the knowledge to know what was going
                    on and how to do it right. There was an exception, however. As an eminent
                    historian, he was quite deficient in any working knowledge of economics. But
                    then, that was similar to the Foreign Service of that generation.</p>
                <p>He had a kind demeanor, never got addled, and always had a long-term -
                    historical, I guess - perspective. He was very useful with Congress because he
                    was credible. His staff meetings often became, I thought, repeats of his Harvard
                    seminars. That was fine by me.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Reischauer was a native-born Japanese and naturalized American. That was
                    quite shocking to many Americans (and many Japanese) in those days. FSOs, I
                    think, still had to receive Department approval to marry a foreigner and, if not
                    granted, the officer had to resign. I didn't hear much gossip about Mrs.
                    Reischauer, but I'm sure there was older embassy wives' chitchat. She was very
                    gracious, even to us junior types.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Johnson?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>FRITTS: U. Alexis Johnson, one of the Service's most senior and experienced
                    officers, was much more operationally inclined. He skillfully worked the
                    Washington interagency process and decision-makers. He had previous experience
                    with Japan and had just come from being deputy ambassador to South Vietnam. As
                    my focus was on Japan in SE Asia, I became aware of how often he arranged to
                    write his own instructions. Like Reischauer, he was well respected within the
                    embassy. I think the Japanese Government also respected him, but were a bit
                    fearful of his influence within the Washington professional power structure.</p>
                <p>I don't remember any policy anecdotes. However, I was put into a golf foursome
                    with him a couple of times and recall that he frequently asked players questions
                    while they putted. He liked to win. He also got out of bunkers very quickly and
                    lightly. He said he'd learned the technique in Vietnam, because the sand bunkers
                    were often booby-trapped.</p>
                <p>I want to mention the DCM, John K. Emerson. He had everybody's full respect - a
                    wonderful man and Japan expert who had been vilified during the McCarthy period
                    to the point where he could never be confirmed as an ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the book he wrote, a memoir, A Ribbon Runs
                        through It?,or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Yes, it's excellent.</p>
                <p>Emmerson had a wonderfully wry sense of humor. For example, I remember that
                    Undersecretary Eugene Rostow and a VIP delegation came to Tokyo one New Year's
                    and disrupted the Japanese officialdom, including Prime Minister Sato. The
                    officials had to return from their hometowns and the only annual vacation (four
                    days) most of them took. The only time you could see Mt. Fuji was during those
                    four days when Tokyo shut down.</p>
                <p>I attended the Country Team meeting chaired by Ambassador Reischauer for Rostow
                    and the group. Rostow was livid. At his request the previous day, the embassy
                    had provided the Foreign Office with advance copies of some confidential
                    proposals to be discussed, including Vietnam and the U.S.-Japan Mutual Security
                    Agreement (MSA). Much to Rostow's ire, the texts of the papers had been
                    published verbatim in that morning's edition of the Asahi Shimbun. He waxed
                    indignant and accused the Japanese Government of all kinds of unscrupulous
                    perfidy. He laced into Reischauer as well. Bring the Japanese into your trust,
                    he said, give them something confidential, and they publish it for the world to
                    see etc. The more he fulminated the angrier he got. It went on and on. Finally,
                    Rostow paused. At that point, John Emerson, one of our finest experts on Japan,
                    including pre-war II, sort of raised his hand and in a room of tomb-like silence
                    said slowly and carefully, “Well, I can remember when the Japanese kept secrets
                    very well, and I prefer it this way.” Wonderful man.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>Several years after he retired to the Hoover Foundation at Stanford University,
                    several of us took him to lunch when he visited Washington. It was during the
                    Chinese Cultural Revolution which also reverberated on American campuses,
                    including Stanford. He recounted that on a recent Saturday, he had gone to
                    Hoover Tower on campus, but it was barricaded by students waving Mao Tse Tung
                    red books and denouncing the USG over Vietnam etc. Emmerson watched for a while,
                    then went to the leader and said, “Look, I'm the only person within a thousand
                    miles of here who has actually talked politics with Mao Tse Tung and Chou
                    En-lai. If you'll let me go up to my office and pick up my mail, I'll come back
                    and tell you about it.” They did and he did. The demonstration stopped. A
                    hundred or so students sat in a circle around him, and he spoke of his days in
                    the caves of Yunnan as a U.S. Army officer assigned to Mao's army, where he
                    interrogated Japanese POWs, and chatted occasionally in English and Japanese
                    with Chou and Mao. That assignment, of course, had led to his being a target of
                    Senator McCarthy and truncated his career. He paused and sipped a wine glass.
                    “You know,” he said, “that's the only time in my life when knowing Mao Tse Tung
                    came in handy.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Vietnam and Japan during this period of time?
                        How wathat seen from your perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: The Japanese were very skittish about the defense and security
                    implications of Vietnam, particularly any erosion of the “Anti War” clause of
                    their Constitution or expanding their role beyond our bilateral mutual security
                    treaty. There was lots of room for interpretations - we wanted them broad, the
                    Japanese wanted them narrow.</p>
                <p>We thus leaned on the Japanese Government to “contribute” to the Vietnam effort
                    non-militarily, which meant economically and financially. In the financial
                    attach�'s office and, subsequently, as part of the economic section, I worked
                    within that policy context. We tried to increase Japanese foreign aid to the
                    area, particularly to South Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and Laos. We sought to
                    tailor their aid to what we thought best for Vietnam and to our interests. For
                    example, almost all of their aid programs were in the form of reparations
                    payments tied to procurement in Japan. We emphasized untying aid as a means to
                    make it go farther competitively and to permit U.S. firms to bid. We also tried
                    to wrap Japan into a number of multilateral organizations concerned with SE
                    Asia, including a very complex system of exchange rate stabilization in Laos. I
                    was often the point person on those issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>In addition, for reasons I don't recall other than a long-term goal of regional
                    economic stability, the USG put a lot of pressure on the Japanese Government to
                    support population planning in SE Asia. Talk about cultural conflict! The GOJ
                    hated the topic and most Japanese were embarrassed even to hear the word. The
                    major Japanese approach to its own successful contraception policy was abortion,
                    which even then we didn't countenance as an export. I wound up responsible for a
                    number of U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and semi-private
                    delegation visits to Japan of true believers designed to “raise visibility” and
                    “break down official Japanese reticence” etc. Because the Japanese were so
                    prudish on the topic, these groups felt the best way to make progress was to be
                    very high profile, bring along the latest “devices”, and use jokes and limericks
                    to “loosen the Japanese up”. I found our embassy translators became quickly
                    unavailable when these groups came to town. Those meetings were just awful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about students? Were they at all in your purview?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Students were not my responsibility. We would, of course, have periodic
                    student demonstrations (”demos”) outside the chancery, particularly over Vietnam
                    and suspicions that the U.S. had nuclear weapons in Japan. In that pre-terrorist
                    age, we didn't take demos seriously - just noise, bother and inconvenience. I
                    remember being late to a Foreign Office appointment because of a “demo.” My
                    counterpart, it turned out, had been prominent in the major demonstrations in
                    the '50s which forced the cancellation of President Eisenhower's trip to Japan.
                    “Oh, yes,” he said, “I remember demos at your chancery well from my student
                    days. It's what we did then; it's what Japanese students always do.” He then
                    added wistfully, “And now, I'm a bureaucrat here. In the elections, I vote
                    Liberal Democratic (conservative), although in my heart I'll always be a
                    socialist. But I'm in the government now.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was living in Tokyo at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: It was fine - Americans were very much liked in Japan as being somewhat
                    special. Tokyo was very urban and crowded, of course, with lots of pollution. We
                    lived in an embassy compound within walking distance of the chancery. Compound
                    living was okay, because most Japanese professionals, including my contacts,
                    lived in compounds and considered it perfectly normal. The yen was 360 to the
                    dollar, so we could easily go to restaurants, Noh and Kabuki performances, and
                    have a maid for childcare. I was working up to my ears, but we could
                    occasionally travel or ski as a family and use Japanese accommodations.
                    Snuggling down with my family in a Japanese ryokan, I thanked FSI for even my
                    modest Japanese capability.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you left Embassy Tokyo. Where next?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>FRITTS: I went to the Japan Desk in State for about three years. I was the
                    economics guy and later became deputy director, but still the main economics
                    guy. I was there about three years - to 1971.</p>
                <p>Q: Let' see, in 1968 Richard Nixon was elected with political debts to the
                    textile states of the South with, I recall, an impact up on Japan. But first,
                    let's talk about when you arrived in Washington. How were our economic relations
                    with Japan? What were the concerns?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Basically, our economic concerns with Japan were more-or-less what they
                    had been and still are since Commodore Perry “opened” Japan in the 1850s - how
                    to open Japan up internationally and to ensure that openings benefitted American
                    interests particularly. As it evolved, Japan's layers of formal, informal and
                    cultural barriers were difficult to penetrate. Each advance uncovered a new
                    problem. We believed that it was in Japanese, American and global interests e.g.
                    the international financial and trading systems, that Japan be a major
                    constructive player. Our specific policy approach for a decade or so was to
                    induce the Japanese to end their insularities as in their interests and ours. At
                    times we were a mentor, in others a friendly advocate, and in others, such as
                    textiles, a fierce aggressor. To degrees, the same policy exists today.The
                    United States, of course, was hardly the open economic society we purported to
                    be. We had our own array of protectionist exemptions and procedures. A favorite
                    weapon was to theoretically negotiate, but actually to force, Japanese
                    imposition of “voluntary export controls” on whatever products were impinging
                    upon American producers at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that brings us to textiles...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Economically, textiles was a receding industry in the U.S. Becoming
                    increasingly outmoded, American producers had sought initially to stave off
                    their decline by moving to the less-unionized South. However, labor-intensive
                    textiles remained under pressure from “unfair and cheap” modernizing producers,
                    such as Japan. The elected representatives in the South became more Republican
                    with great political clout in the Nixon Administration. Thus, we sought to
                    negotiate a series of “voluntary” Japanese export restraints on textiles and
                    ease the pressures on the American market at the cost, of course, of the
                    American consumer. The Japanese resisted strenuously.</p>
                <p>The State Department had the great good fortune in those years of having Phil
                    Trezise as the Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs. A career officer, he
                    had formerly been our Ambassador to the Organization for Economic Cooperation
                    and Development (OECD). He knew the issues inside and out and had also served in
                    Japan. He's just about the finest FSO role model I ever knew. A man of great
                    knowledge, infinite patience, common sense, courage and impeccable integrity. He
                    resisted interagency and highly charged political pressures. He got us through
                    difficult times with Japan, the White House and volatile Cabinet members by
                    patient, calm, wry wisdom.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>For reasons I don't entirely know, he decided I had some talent and that it
                    suited his purpose to have an occasional confidential action officer on Japan
                    outside his own Economic Affairs Bureau. He thus called the Assistant Secretary
                    for East Asian Affairs, Marshall Green, to borrow me on those issues. He also
                    told Marshall that I would not always be able to divulge what I was doing, but
                    that Marshall could check with him on any qualms. Marshall agreed. On a couple
                    of occasions, that constraint bent my immediate boss, the Japan Country
                    Director, considerably out of shape. The arrangement lasted about two years.</p>
                <p>Thus, I frequently worked directly with Phil and was part of the formal commodity
                    trade negotiation delegations he led to Japan, which included other agencies,
                    Congressmen and trade reps. His understanding of Japanese officialdom was
                    superb. They trusted him. He had a conceptual long-range vision of how the trade
                    and economic issues fit into U.S.-Japan relations, which he considered vitally
                    important. That trade issues did not crash the U.S.-Japan relationship in those
                    was due in no small part to his skills. While he was respected within the USG
                    and on the Hill, knives were frequently out.</p>
                <p>The Secretary of Commerce, Maurice Stans, was a major political supporter of
                    American textile producers and a formidable adversary of State and Phil. He
                    would send Commerce or even private industry emissaries to Japan in secrecy with
                    instructions to avoid the U.S. Embassy, threaten the Japanese Government with
                    dire acts, and instruct the Japanese not to inform us about the discussions. The
                    last stricture would last about twelve hours after arrival when the Japanese
                    would let Phil know, followed by their media. The USG looked divided, weak and
                    foolish. An already bad political-economic situation would become worse.</p>
                <p>After being caught several times, Stans switched to sending reps who would check
                    in only with our ambassador, who wasn't supposed to report back. The ambassador,
                    Armin Meyer, was put between a rock and a hard place. He was a Middle East
                    expert newly arrived in Japan and thus without much clout in Japan or within the
                    USG. Secretary Rogers reportedly had trouble confronting Secretary Stans or NSC
                    Advisor Henry Kissinger, so the burden really fell on Trezise as Stans and
                    others, including southern Congressmen, rode roughshod and tried to call the
                    shots directly on trade and financial matters. It was a tough period.</p>
                <p>Eventually, Trezise was able in his way to attain Japanese acquiescence on
                    voluntary textile export restraints and openings in commodities, such as beef
                    and citrus. His scenarios on other products and issues became the future models.
                    One prescient Trezise insight was his prediction to the Japanese that within ten
                    years, they would adopt the same approach as the U.S. when sectors in their
                    economy became pressed by imports from Korea and Southeast Asia. And so it
                    was.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that you'd be doing things that you couldn't
                        telyour colleagues in the East Asia Bureau. Like what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Given the adversarial environment within the USG, Trezise would often
                    seek informal understandings with the Japanese before surfacing them within the
                    USG. Trying to work out cooperatively what might fly or not. What was or wasn't
                    negotiable. He was a master at building an eventual consensus within the USG,
                    with American commodity interests, and with the Japanese. However, premature
                    formal consultation meant leaks, sabotage and dangerous failure.</p>
                <p>How often Phil spoke with Marshall, I don't know, but I do know that Marshall
                    trusted Phil. The issues were so sensitive and the stakes so large politically
                    that I don't think Marshall passed much on to his Country Director for Japan,
                    Dick Finn. Dick and his successor, Dick Ericsson, were very perturbed when I
                    couldn't tell him what I was up to.</p>
                <p>I remember literally racing back to my office from Phil's office one night having
                    been given forty minutes to draft a letter from the President to Prime Minister
                    Sato. Once in my office, I had writer's block. Then Dick Finn came in and wanted
                    a briefing on what the crisis was and what I'm writing. I couldn't tell him. It
                    was tense. I still met the deadline.</p>
                <p>Bear in mind I'm not a major actor in all this. I'm neither conceptualizing new
                    policy nor negotiating trade-offs. I'm still mid-level. I was a “go to” guy who
                    drafted quickly, understood the issues, could integrate disparate facts, add a
                    few creative licks, and report well. Most of the really substantive stuff came
                    from Trezise's own people. While they didn't always know his full purposes, they
                    trusted his wisdom and integrity. Trezise used some wiles, but he did so to
                    sustain negotiations against the rogue actors roaming around.</p>
                <p>Q: During the Nixon period, there were several shocks or, as the Japanese said,
                    shokkus, in U.S.-Japan relations. What were those all about?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: The short answer is non-consultation. Advance and cooperative bilateral
                    consultation had been a prime policy mantra toward Japan for decades. It was a
                    key bedrock to Japanese attitudes toward their U.S. relationship. They gave us
                    considerable policy slack across-the-board assuming we would consult with them
                    on any initiative or situation involving their key national interests. We issued
                    repeated assurances. We even set up annual Economic Cabinet meetings to testify
                    to it.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, the U.S. talks a good advance consultation game, but often doesn't
                    play it. Then or now. Just recently (2000), Clinton overflew Japan to go to
                    China. It was the first time an American President going to China had not
                    stopped in Japan. It was a major shock and demeaned the U.S.-Japan relationship.
                    Each time the U.S. insults Japan in that manner on key issues weakens the
                    special relationship from which the U.S. so benefits.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>But back to the “Nixon shokkus”. They were three in number and hithe Japanese in
                    key areas of their national interest.</p>
                <p>First, the U.S. announced a successful secret opening to China. Japan had
                    consistently held back on its long-standing desire to improve relationswith
                    China in deference to our hostile stance. Every time they wanted to loosen up,
                    we essentially forbade it. Then we moved and left them hanging.</p>
                <p>Second, the decision to float the U.S. dollar by negating U.S. adherence to the
                    gold standard at $35 per ounce. We had labeled that policy as a linchpin in our
                    huge financial relationship.</p>
                <p>And third, the U.S. embargoed soybean exports because of short supply. We had a
                    virtual international monopoly on soybeans. Soybean products are a major part of
                    the Japanese diet and their consumers went into panic. An unintended result was
                    that the Japanese determined never to be caught short again, made massive
                    investments in soybean production in Brazil, and the U.S. created a major
                    competitor in soybeans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Japanese negotiating techniques when
                        working athe Trezise level on these narrow, although sensitive, issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, all of us working on Japan had to adjust to the fact that not much
                    would ever remain confidential on either side for very long. Thee were so many
                    actors with axes to grind. On our side, some thought that public Japan-bashing
                    was the way to progress with the not inconsiderable goals of enhancing their own
                    image, careers or political ambitions. And strangely, up to a point, we
                    agreed.</p>
                <p>To create their needed consensus, the Japanese often require a measure of being
                    backed into a corner before their various groups can agree upon concessions as
                    “unavoidable.” They need a catalyst and sometimes a series of catalysts. That
                    may sound counter to what I said before about rogue negotiators and
                    mismanagement of U.S.-Japan economic relations. However, there were times when
                    forcefulness was necessary to provide a means of agreement. Sometimes the
                    Foreign Office even wanted it and would infer how it should be applied. On the
                    other hand, gratuitous insults, overblown rhetoric and threats stymied or
                    reversed progress. Given American culture and our governance system, it's almost
                    impossible for State to fine tune policy, particularly in trade and finance
                    where the Congress and interest groups participate directly. Trezise came as
                    close as anyone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Japanese were/are occasionally accused of not
                        implementintrade agreements. Was that the case?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>FRITTS: Frankly, both sides would occasionally renege under some subterfuge or
                    other. We would often cite revised legal interpretations, such as on initiating
                    anti-dumping actions against Japan.</p>
                <p>The Japanese reputation derived from the fact that after negotiating the removal
                    or easing of formal barriers, various informal and cultural barriers would then
                    be uncovered. Our exports and investments thus didn't increase as expected or
                    Japanese “voluntary” export restrictions would lag.</p>
                <p>There were also serious misunderstandings. President Johnson twisted Prime
                    Minister Sato's arm, or possibly literally squeezed it, to force his approval to
                    carry out “voluntary” textile export restrictions. The meeting at the White
                    House was private with only Sato's interpreter present, a serous Johnson error.
                    There are about fifteen shades of “yes” in Japanese. The one Sato used was
                    translated as “Yes.” Actually, when reconstructed after the fact, we thought it
                    more akin to “I understand what you're saying and will do my best to consider
                    how it might be done”. Johnson later reportedly went ballistic about Sato when
                    the Japanese Government denied privately and then publicly there had been any
                    “agreement.”</p>
                <p>Japanese has many nice-sounding but non-binding phrases that they often sought to
                    insert into communiques and agreements. In English they come out as “full and
                    proper consideration”, “best efforts”, and that kind of approach. We knew what
                    it meant e.g. “We'll try, but progress will be slow”. The uninitiated either
                    didn't understand or, even when we told them, were eager to proclaim public
                    victory for image purposes. As reality set in, their reactions would charge
                    Japanese “run-arounds” and duplicity. After I left Japanese affairs, the USG
                    tried to adopt quantitative benchmarks to measure progress, with occasional
                    success, but also much rancor as the Japanese charged that we were waging
                    “managed trade” rather than “free trade”.</p>
                <p>Q: I would have thought that there would be a certain almost career or
                    professional danger to bringing in American interest groups working on some of
                    these things. In a way, by explaining how the Japanese operate, it could sound
                    like you've either gone native or you're giving too many concessions. It must be
                    difficult to bring your fellow conferees up to speed about how to deal with the
                    Japanese.</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, negotiations with Japan are hardball. Their officials are
                    well-educated and experienced. Their professionals understand us as well or
                    better as we profess to understand them. There is gamesmanship involved, but we
                    are prisoners of our culture as they are prisoners of theirs.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>Given the period we're talking about, the '60s and '70s - what we then thought as
                    rather arcane but accurate knowledge of the Japanese system is now common
                    knowledge by even the most junior business people going out to Japan, many of
                    whom speak fluent Japanese. Meanwhile, Japan has evolved - has become much more
                    like us.</p>
                <p>An anecdote about their system. We had a series of U.S.-Japan Joint Economic
                    Conferences, which were Cabinet-level meetings held annually between the U.S.
                    and Japan. Part of the concept was to expose more insular Japanese ministers and
                    officials, other than just the Foreign Office, to us and our concerns - and to
                    induce them to be more interactive and open in discussing issues and problems.
                    On one occasion, I was part of an advance team with Phil Trezise and others who
                    arrived a few days early. As the working-level coordinator, I had thrashed
                    through the issues within the USG, including the briefing book policy papers,
                    and set up the arrangements. As per usual, I had drafted, negotiated USG
                    clearances, and provided a draft joint communiqu� to the Japanese Embassy in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>I arrived in Japan overnight, along with Phil and others, and was looking forward
                    to spending half a day or so getting around and talking with people whom I knew
                    in Japan before getting down to the work of the conference. Early in the
                    morning, I had a call from my Foreign Office fellow counterpart asking me to
                    come over “...for awhile”. I demurred, saying I had some other things to do.
                    “No, we really want to see you. You really have to be here.” “Okay,” I said,
                    “I'll stop by the Ministry.” “Oh, no,” he said, “Come to the Okura Hotel.”</p>
                <p>When I got there, I entered a suite they had turned into an interagency cockpit,
                    with a Foreign Ministry guy in charge. I was put at a small table in a corner of
                    a rear room. I couldn't get out without having to walk over about a dozen
                    officials who filled the room. I became captive to negotiating the joint
                    communiqu� and I was there for the next twelve hours. We went through the issues
                    and phrases piece by piece. We'd reach an impasse, they'd form a whispering
                    group, a junior officer would leave, and some time later, he and new people
                    would come back and huddle in the other rooms I could see from my corner. What
                    they were doing was running over to MITI or the Ministry of Finance and
                    elsewhere, negotiating with those ministries, and then back to the Okura with
                    revised wording to negotiate. I was there, as I say, for 12 hours or so. I don't
                    remember either food or a john break. We worked out the communiqu� which
                    constituted the outcome in advance of the Joint Cabinet meeting to be held. That
                    shows their intensity and the complexity of consultation required to achieve a
                    Japanese consensus. All of them versus me. Quite eye-opening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your negotiated communiqu� stand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Only one word got changed. I was quite proud of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, in retrospect, do you believe our economic
                        negotiations witJapan have been successful?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Oh, yes, very. Japan has opened tremendously. So much so, its culture is
                    changing rapidly. Each advance was too small by our standards, but given the
                    context of where the Japanese were coming from, quite long by theirs. I think
                    the U.S.-Japan relationship can be considered as one of the best and most
                    successfully managed bilateral relationships in history. A true testament to
                    long-term American diplomacy. All of Asia would be in a much different strategic
                    environment today without the firm U.S.-Japan relationship forged over a
                    half-century. And economics are an important part of that success and
                    environment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that way then? Or just, “Oh, God, dealing
                        with thJapanese?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: I always knew, concurred in, and fiddled with our overall long-term
                    policy. But few of us then would have predicted Japan's rise to a top three
                    world economy. However, when I left the Japan Desk, I had been totally immersed
                    in U.S.-Japan issues for about seven years. I was tired of the problems. Some
                    years later in the Carter Administration, a new East Asia Assistant Secretary,
                    Dick Holbrooke, asked me to become reimmersed as Japan Country Director. Much to
                    his surprise, I turned him down to direct another of his offices. I just didn't
                    want to take on what to me were old problems in new guises, political and
                    economic. I wonder how our Middle East colleagues bear it.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, some issues just don't go away. Did the political climate change at all
                    in Japan while you were handling it there? I guess it was the Liberal Democratic
                    Party (LDP) throughout...</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Yes, the LDP reigned and the political climate was static. But there was
                    a major change in how the Japanese did their diplomatic business. The quality of
                    Japanese representation in Washington and abroad jumped markedly. They always
                    had good people, but a real sea change occurred with their international skills.
                    Always well trained technically, they became much more global, more confident in
                    their ability to interact internationally, and adopted a higher profile in
                    expressing positions. Non-foreign ministry types became fluent in English. Even
                    spouses, who previously could rarely speak English, began to initiate
                    conversations rather than huddle together. Rather than just working the usual
                    places like the State Department, they expanded into the media and onto the
                    Hill. They became Americanized in the conduct of diplomacy. It happened in the
                    space of a few years.</p>
                <p>Q: Were they picking this up on their own, or was there a sort of tutorial with
                    us saying, “If you really want to get something done in the United States,
                    you've got to work the media, you've got to work Congress?”</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>FRITTS: We had always sought to engender greater Japanese openness, less
                    insularity and a more global view of their responsibilities. But the change was
                    also generational, engendered by growing confidence in a world class economy,
                    increased experience, the dimming memory and inhibitions of WWII, the lifting of
                    foreign exchange controls which sent floods of Japanese abroad to clog world
                    tourist sights. Japanese society was changing, and the Foreign Office
                    anticipated and was even ahead of the curve. Would that our Foreign Service
                    could be so farsighted and financially supported.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find the Japanese media? From what I gather, it's a pretty hungry
                    beast - lots of newspapers, lots of TV, and they're all over the place?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: The Japanese media are hyper-competitive and very influential. Anything
                    happening in the U.S. and the USG, particularly with any relevance to the U.S.
                    and Japan, is automatically big news. The U.S. is covered extensively and
                    intensively. The media national circulation plus proportion of readership and
                    viewers are much higher than in the U.S. The media were quite insular then. They
                    viewed the first Nixon Administration as “weak” because Nixon's competitors in
                    the primaries were included in his cabinet. Now they have bureaus around the
                    world with very qualified, sophisticated journalists.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved when Kissinger went to China? It was

                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: I had minor roles in damage control - drafting instructions on how to
                    mollify the Japanese. My only role in the opening to China was that John
                    Holdridge, who was on the National Security Council staff, realized he had to
                    have white tie and tails for the Nixon trip to China. He knew I had a set
                    (left-over from being a member of the University of Michigan Men's Glee Club. He

                        downplathe importance of Japan. That all of our effort was focused on

                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: No, not at all. Vietnam actually provoked a good deal of policy attention
                    toward Japan, albeit often in a Vietnam context. We were up to our ears in
                    trying to assuage Japanese fears that Vietnam was going to disrupt all of
                    Southeast Asia, cut down on their lucrative trade and investments, and create
                    regional instabilities. Their nightmare was that Vietnam could lead to U.S.
                    military conflicts with China and/or Russia or a renewal of war in Korea. Japan
                    wanted an end to the Vietnam War. From Japan, we wanted all the political and,
                    particularly, economic support or “contributions” we could garner. I guess our
                    diplomacy could be termed as focused on assuagement, inducement and reassurance.
                    We tried to get them increasingly involved in Vietnam and SE Asia, not
                    militarily, but economically and financially.</p>

                    still early days in Korea, I guess, so Korea wasn't much of an economic power,
                    was it?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: No, but Japan was still negotiating reparations and trade agreements with
                    South Korea. Whatever our difficulties in negotiating with Japan, we took relief
                    from the fact that it was much worse between the Japanese and Koreans. Their
                    bilateral “discussions” were marked by Korean vituperation and harassment.</p>
                <p>I remember discussing Korea with a Japanese diplomat, who had come back from
                    meetings in Seoul. After we had discussed the substance for my report, he added.
                    “You know, in negotiating with Americans, we're very careful to write down
                    everything precisely and clearly, because we know you'll raise it with us and
                    we'll need to be prepared. But we don't take notes of talks with the Koreans.
                    Whatever is agreed won't last anyhow, so why bother?”</p>
                <p>Q: Now this was the Nixon White House anKissinger is national security advisor.
                    Did relations with Japan reflect their “command and control” styles?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, I've spoken of Maurice Stans, the Secretary of Commerce, who cut an
                    independent swath, that U.S. economic policy with Japan was often schizophrenic,
                    and of Trezise' efforts to provide cohesion from his level. Okinawa reversion
                    occurred in 1972 with Secretary Rogers. Whatever the truth, we felt Kissinger
                    was Europe and China focused and didn't care much about what we viewed as the
                    tremendously important relationship with Japan. We thought he took it for
                    granted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the East Asia Bureau feel during this time that Japan
                        wagetting enough attention?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, we were, of course, incredulous at the non-notification to Japan
                    before the U.S. opening to China, the negation of dollar convertibility, and the
                    soybean embargo. They were insults to a major ally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the feeling that this was lack of attention or
                        deliberate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: I don't know what Kissinger now says, but they were omissions we couldn't
                    understand. Frankly, we thought it would never have happened to a Western
                    European country. Our memos said how bad it was, but, of course, it was water
                    over the dam. Our professional focus had to be on damage control, such as citing
                    exceptional circumstance, no lessening of our strong relationship, sending out
                    VIP's with kind words - that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, I think one of the ideas that was floated around, why this happened was
                    that if you told a Japanese anything, even at the highest level, it would be
                    leaked within a very short time.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>FRITTS: That probably was a concern and, unfortunately, it was probably true. We
                    generally operated on the premise that most of what we did with Japan would
                    become public, particularly on the economic side. Defense issues had a better
                    record, although they were not immune, as per my Rostow-Emmerson story.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, you had now spent seven years on Japan. Right now, I'm interviewing Bill
                    Breer, and, God, he never left Japan. I mean, he was either in Japan or on the
                    Japanese Desk for virtually his entire career. Now retired, he's chair of the
                    Japan office of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). Did
                    you consider becoming a Japan hand? Or did you want to get out from under?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: I considered a career path on Japan. In fact, while at embassy Tokyo, as
                    I mentioned, I wangled an additional two months at the Japanese language school
                    in Yokohama. But as I stated, I was tired of the same recurring problems.</p>
                <p>Also, consistent with my career pattern, I wanted something different. I never
                    wanted to return to the same country, even in a different slot. I also didn't
                    want to spend another year or so on advanced Japanese language training, which I
                    felt was not professionally worthwhile, except for ticket punching. I wanted a
                    new experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how did you go about getting out from under?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: It will sound odd, but having worked on economics for decade, I felt I
                    ought to study the subject.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is just about the time that they were developing
                        thsix-month economic crash course at the Foreign Service Institute
                        (FSI)?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: That's correct. It was designed as a master's degree equivalent. But my
                    interest in the course was to become better at policy advocacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>FRITTS: I had learned that to affect interagency outcomes, I had to be credible
                    in economic analysis, particularly with Treasury, plus the international
                    financial organizations and trade people. The usual Foreign Service horseback
                    economics were not enough to succeed in interagency conflict. I needed to
                    recognize faulty economic theory, pick from or add wheat to chaff, and speak the
                    jargon in adversarial debate. In part, I looked on advanced economics as a form
                    of language training.</p>
                <p>Intellectually, I had become reasonably adept at what we now call microeconomics.
                    I wanted to put those pieces into a conceptual whole - what we now call
                    macroeconomics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Quite difficult. The Economics field was beginning its switch from a
                    descriptive approach to quantitative, including regression analysis. Even though
                    I was only in my 30s, I found it hard to be back in a classroom, with evening
                    study and quizzes, rather than being operational.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the course meet your goals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Very much so. It stood me in good stead the rest of my career and after.
                    In fact, I counsel international relations students at the College of William
                    &amp; Mary, where I currently sit, to get a full dose of economics. Almost all
                    foreign policy problems are political-economic or vice-versa. You better have
                    both halves of the sandwich.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you use it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Several ways. One was the ability to spot baloney - biased or inadequate
                    presentations. As ambassador, I found it very helpful with USAID when I was
                    being urged to approve projects or programs. I could argue in their terms and
                    get things changed. Sometimes I had political concerns that I could argue more
                    effectively in an economic context. Later as a Country Director, I became
                    reasonably credible. Not many regional country directors had a conversant
                    economic background. When needed, I could break down the stereotype of political
                    apologist. Overseas, in Rwanda and Ghana, I could talk shop rather than
                    platitudes with expert officials and ministers plus IBRD and IMF types. I became
                    more effective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this bring you up to a par with sort of the general
                        publiservants you'd be dealing with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>FRITTS: It depends. Compared to many FSOs of the time, it was superior. Compared
                    to Treasury, I had become better, but not par. After all, I still wasn't a
                    trained Ph.D. economist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the next post we'll talk about was where and
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Jakarta, Indonesia. The summer of 1971.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why Indonesia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Out of the blue. I was walking down the hall one day and Jules Katz,
                    Trezise's principal deputy, said, “Hi, Bob. Congratulations. You're just been
                    paneled (assigned) for Jakarta.” That's how it was done in those days. So I was
                    assigned as first secretary in the Economic Section</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In terms of assignment, did you know Francis Wilcox, who
                        was thpatron of so many economic officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: I knew her, but naively never thought of her as having anything to do
                    with me, as I had been in the East Asia bureau. She was the long-time executive
                    director of the Economic Affairs bureau. She was very loyal to Trezise. Very
                    capable, with something of a fierce reputation, which I sensed, but never saw.
                    Since I didn't work in her bureau, I teased her a bit. Not many officers
                    did.</p>
                <p>Q: She had a lot of influence watching over her brood of economic officers. She
                    saw that her chicks were well treated and really worked at it.</p>
                <p>FRITTS: So I learned after the fact. She knew everyone's corridor reputation. She
                    certainly knew I worked with Trezise a lot and that I admired him. Speaking of
                    admiration, some years later a number of us recommended Trezise for a
                    Rockefeller national award for integrity in the public service. He didn't win,
                    but we tried.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're now in Indonesia in 1971. Sukarno is gone and
                        Suharto iin power.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: That's right. Suharto had been in office about six years or so. Our
                    ambassador was Frank Galbraith, a fine person - he understood the country very
                    well, spoke fluent Bahasa, knew everybody. He'd made a career out of one
                    country. He'd been one of the first Americans to step ashore after the Japanese
                    surrender in 1945. He was always very patient - in policy and management. It was
                    a happy embassy with respect up and down.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>I was a first secretary in the Economic Section. Peter Seip, briefly, and then
                    Erland Higginbotham was the economic counselor. My focus was on government and
                    commercial banks and the Indonesian financial system. As we sit here today
                    (1999), the Indonesian financial system has collapsed. It had also collapsed
                    before my arrival in Japan and came close to doing so again while I was
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the politico-economic situation in Indonesia when
                        yoarrived there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Quite stable. The Suharto Government was well established, foreign
                    investment was pouring in, some of it naive, almost all of it involved in
                    payoffs. Indonesia was leading the creation of a new regional body - the
                    Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Human rights were part of our
                    policy, but not on top. Indonesian and embassy memories of the traumatic 1965
                    Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) coup attempt and its implications for
                    Indonesia and our interests in Southeast Asia were still fresh. Our policy view
                    was unambiguous: The U.S. and Indonesia had luckily escaped a strategic bullet
                    and we should seek to ensure that it wouldn't happen again. We thus had large
                    foreign aid projects, PL-40 commodity transfers, and a large military assistance
                    and training (IMET) program. The economy was weak and fragile, although foreign
                    investment, including American, was exploding.</p>
                <p>The foreign aid program was headed by Dick Cashin - very sophisticated, smooth
                    and capable. Possibly the best AID director I ever knew. His thrust was to
                    support truly viable - the emphasis is on viable - self-sustaining development
                    in Indonesia. I don't remember examples, but he thought “outside the box.” He
                    later became a senior official at a non-governmental organizations (NGO).</p>
                <p>Despite corruption and an autocratic political system, Indonesia was beginning to
                    make marked economic progress. It was shifting from a food importer to rice
                    self-sufficiency, creating a domestic capital market, becoming a modern resource
                    producer, (particularly in natural gas), hyperinflation was decreasing, and
                    standards of living increasing. The previous description of Indonesia as “shared
                    poverty,” coined by the then well-known anthropologist Dennis Goertz, was almost
                    gone in the urban areas. Instead, there were blatantly visible income
                    differentials, corruption, banking manipulations and other dysfunctions, which
                    now are lumped into the term of “crony capitalism.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But our impression of the of the Suharto regime at that
                        time wafavorable?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>FRITTS: We were very supportive of the Suharto Government. As I said, the 1965
                    abortive coup was still a very recent event. Our conceptual vision was of a
                    strong, viable, stable and economically dynamic Indonesia stretching for 3,000
                    miles across the strategic supply and trade lines of ourselves, our military
                    forces, and our allies and friends, particularly Japan.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any sort of examination of Indonesia and its diverse nationalities?
                    Right now we're talking about major problems as of today in East Timor, and then
                    there's this Aceh group and all. Were we looking at this all being held together
                    by force and possibly breaking up?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: We believed in and supported Indonesian cohesion. Sukarno's great
                    achievement was putting these hundreds of groups and islands into a conglomerate
                    nation state with a commonly used national artificial language (Bahasa). Even
                    so, there were some Indonesian suspicions about the depth of our commitment,
                    because of an alleged CIA plot in the 1950s to support an insurrection in, I
                    think, Sumatra and bring down former President Sukarno by breaking up the
                    country. I've forgotten the historical details. But our policy could not have
                    been firmer - the strategic necessity for a stable Indonesia. I believe our
                    policy is the same today, because if Indonesia breaks apart into its many
                    entities, it would create severe problems throughout Southeast Asia, plus Japan,
                    China and India. Very destabilizing. As we've seen with the former Soviet Union
                    and Yugoslavia, devolution is no solution. Instead, it spawns conflicts. As
                    someone once said, we should not be lulled by the Indonesian culture and its
                    emphasis on conflict avoidance. “Amok” is a Bahasa word.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with the Indonesians, the banks,
                        and theconomic instruments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: We had very easy access to most - not all - officialdom. My predecessor
                    even sat in occasionally on internal meetings of the Indonesian central bank
                    (Bank Indonesia). By the time I arrived, the immediate hyperinflationary crises
                    were easing and I did not have such invitations. But appointments were easy; one
                    could even wander around and drop in a bit to chit-chat. The banking system
                    people appreciated our interest in what they were trying to achieve, both in
                    terms of our direct support plus the influence the USG had with the World Bank,
                    the IMF and other donor organizations. Although hyperinflation was declining, it
                    was still high. The banks offered consumer rupiah deposit rates of a hundred
                    percent per month. The rates were so lucrative that Ambassador Galbraith finally
                    convened an embassy task force, including me, which concluded it was a conflict
                    of interest for embassy employees to covert dollars into deposit rupiahs. Some
                    AID folk had tens of thousands of dollars invested personally. The Indonesian
                    Government regarded the U.S. embassy as critically important to its interests.
                    Indonesia is an exotic place to begin with and it was also fun and challenging
                    professionally.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>However, Indonesian officials could be tough and ultra-sensitive. They had fought
                    a long bloody war with the Dutch and could be quick to take serious offence at
                    any hint of Western arrogance or challenge. As usual, we generally gave a lot of
                    know-it-all economic advice and guidance, both directly via USAID and our
                    economic section and by trying to influence the IBRD, IMF, NGOs and other
                    donors, such as the Harvard Development Advisory Service, resident in Jakarta.
                    But one had to be careful as Indonesian cultural sensitivities and sense of
                    nationalism were very strong. Luckily for us and Indonesia, the chief Indonesian
                    economic ministers and officials were American-trained, the “Berkeley Mafia,”
                    but even so, too high a profile could be distinctly counter-productive.</p>
                <p>I also enjoyed Indonesian humor. When one of my best contacts, a senior Ministry
                    of Finance official retired, he took pride in the fact that he had actually
                    exceeded the mandatory retirement age by three years. His Indonesian father had
                    served in the Dutch colonial government and as his son my contact had access to
                    special schools run by the Dutch Government. One day he had been called to the
                    teacher's desk for some purpose and the teacher had asked how old he was? He had
                    replied, “I'm twelve, sir”. “No, you're not,” the schoolmaster replied, “You're
                    too small. You must be nine”. My retiring friend commented “When the Dutchman
                    said you were nine, you were nine. And that's colonialism!”</p>
                <p>Actually, that was an understatement. I knew he had also been a senior guerilla
                    combat officer in the independence war against the Dutch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about corruption that seems to have been a major
                        source of Suharto's recent (1998) downfall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: We were very aware of it. It was well known, for example, that for
                    Indonesians to gain contracts with BULOG, the commodity import-export agency,
                    which also handled our PL-480 shipments, that bribes were involved. Although
                    Dick Cashin was quite effective in insulating our PL-480 programs, our efforts
                    elsewhere had little impact.</p>
                <p>The embassy standing view was that as Indonesia became more prosperous,
                    corruption would become less. I thought that simplistic. Using economic
                    principles, I wrote an analysis of Indonesian corruption which argued that as
                    the prey became larger, so would the wolves. It earned some sort of Department
                    award.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>We counseled American business not to pay bribes, but what were their
                    alternatives? A very aggressive and astute commercial attach�, Joseph Harary,
                    was dead-set against bribery. He tried to find ways for businesses to work with
                    groups and organizations that were not corrupt, but it was swimming upstream.
                    American firms would agree with us, but then do what they deemed required. Many
                    avoided the embassy, because of the U.S. law against bribery and the belief that
                    the less we knew about them the better. Of course, Indonesia was not alone in
                    crony capitalism. It was endemic throughout Asia. Some may even argue there's a
                    bit of it in the United States from time to time...</p>
                <p>And we sometimes didn't help our case. I recall when a congressional delegation
                    came to Jakarta for annual PL-480 negotiations. At lunch, I sat next to an
                    American businessman with the delegation. I asked him what he did. He said he
                    was the “social chairman” and avoided further conversation. During the lunch, I
                    sat next to a Development Ministry counterpart. I noticed an Indonesian minister
                    at the head table confer with a junior-type who came to our table and whispered
                    to my counterpart who got tense, jumped up, and left. After lunch, it was
                    announced, to my surprise, that a PL-480 agreement had been reached and the
                    afternoon session was canceled. On leaving, I saw my counterpart rushing about
                    outside. I asked him what was going on? “Don't you know?”, he said. “We've been
                    told we can have the agreement as it stands, if we can put two prostitutes into
                    every congressional hotel room by 3:00 p.m. I'm half-way there.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So did American commercial interests continue to
                        grow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Sure. They were very large. There was a real surge of American
                    investment, particularly in resource development and American bank loans.
                    Suharto had been there long enough for Indonesia to look attractive and able to
                    pay from oil and gas receipts. The economy really began to come along as
                    hyperinflation declined. An Indonesia stock exchange began. The new foreign
                    investment law was quite liberal, was codified, and petty corruption declined as
                    the government consolidated multi-permits into a more-or-less one-stop
                    investment promotion office. There was a huge inflow of American foreign
                    investment in those years.</p>
                <p>Indeed, American banks helped precipitate an Indonesian financial crisis in their
                    lemming-like rush to extend short-term loans to Indonesian state-owned producers
                    of raw materials, particularly the state oil firm, Pertamina. The Indonesians
                    skillfully parlayed the financial lust far beyond the ability to repay and the
                    house of cards collapsed. Eventually, an IMF-led consortium bailed the banks
                    out. It was an object lesson that so-called sophisticated risk-analysis is
                    ignored when CEO's want to assert image and egos. If my competitor has a $50
                    million dollar loan to a client, I've got to have $75 million, no matter what
                    the data may show or, in the frequent case of Pertamina, did not show.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the oil business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: The oil business was going well, but as I recall, the really big major
                    business was liquefied natural gas (LNG), which requires billions of dollars in
                    investment. Major LNG facilities were built at that time.</p>
                <p>Q: I interviewed Ambassador Roy Huffington, who invested quite a bit of time and
                    effort in the oil and petroleum business. What about Japanese products? Were
                    they sort of flooding the market, beating out American?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Not really. I recall serious issues over big-ticket items, like GE
                    hydroelectric turbines pitted against Hitachi. We were also urging the
                    Indonesians to press the Japanese to untie their reparations agreements from
                    procurement in Japan. It was about that time that the Embassy was permitted to
                    promote a single American firm rather than all American firms for a contract or
                    sale. We were at least equally competitive toward Japanese foreign investment
                    which, in a broader context, we welcomed. But we wanted a fair American
                    shot.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: The Chinese-Indonesian business community had never really been “out”,
                    despite discrimination, occasional anti-Chinese riots, and the efforts to link
                    the aborted coup to the Peoples Republic of China. Most had adopted Indonesian
                    names. The main financiers remained and prospered as personal bankers to
                    Suharto, his family and others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds as if we had good access and knew a great deal
                        about thgovernment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: That's true, but we also recognized our gaps. Later, as country director,
                    I became very concerned that our excellent access at the top was too narrowly
                    based.</p>
                <p>Our contacts at the top stemmed from two people - Ambassador Frank Galbraith, who
                    knew everybody worth knowing over two generations, and an exceptionally capable
                    defense attach�, Colonel George Benson USA. I think Benson also had three or
                    four tours in Indonesia. He was there during the PKI coup attempt and knew
                    Suharto and the other mainly Javanese officers as majors. That group became the
                    new power structure. While Benson and Galbraith had unique access, the
                    Indonesians are very sensitive about foreigners. Galbraith and Benson were
                    professionally prudent in how they went about it. I should add that Ed Masters,
                    who succeeded Galbraith, also had good access, because he had been a
                    well-regarded former Deputy Chief of Mission in Jakarta. For a decade or more,
                    we had exceptional access and influence. More than any other foreign embassy in
                    Indonesia.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>But it was difficult to identify and cultivate middle-grade officers who were the
                    future leaders. The senior Indonesia military severely restricted access to
                    mid-level officers by foreigners, including diplomats and defense attaches.
                    Their standing orders were that younger officers needed official permission to
                    attend any embassy events or meet with foreign diplomats or officials, even
                    socially. So how to keep in touch?</p>
                <p>The answer, albeit partial, was most unexpected - through Harriet Isom, one of
                    our consular officers. Harriet had been arguing long and strong that as a Bahasa
                    Indonesia language officer, she should be in the Political Section, even in an
                    Islamic country. Galbraith and the DCM, Skipper Purnell, believed she could do
                    no useful work there and refused. Harriet finally created enough pressure from
                    the Department that Galbraith agreed reluctantly to give her a three-month shot.
                    The three months became two years plus.</p>
                <p>She was six feet tall and, in those days, wore a blonde beehive hairdo that added
                    another eight inches. Indonesians average about five foot-six. She was something
                    else - imposing, smart, deft, assertive and language qualified. Indonesian
                    officialdom had never seen her like. A real curiosity. She became our hostess
                    with the mostest - multi- parties and open-houses per month at her modest house.
                    And guess who mingled there? Indonesian majors, captains, lieutenant colonels -
                    all came to Harriet's. Why? Because no permission needed. Why? Because she was a
                    woman and thus, by definition, no threat. She didn't count either as a diplomat
                    or a foreigner.</p>
                <p>Naturally, we all made a bee-line to Harriet's. Col. Benson became a regular. It
                    was an eye-opener for me. I learned how effectively astute woman officers can
                    succeed in sexist societies by exploiting the biases to their and the U.S.
                    advantage. I later saw it happen in South Africa and heard of it in Saudi
                    Arabia. Harriet was terrific. She was ambassador twicLaos and Mali.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, my concern over the generational contact gap was misplaced. In the
                    '70s and '80s, we thought Suharto would step down at the next or following
                    election. As we know now, it didn't happen. Far better if it had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What in general were you picking up from the Indonesians
                        abouour Vietnam policy and the American role?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>FRITTS: At that time, the Indonesians had sort of a two-prong policy that stemmed
                    from economic and military weakness. They would not publicly gainsay the war in
                    Viet Nam, but neither would they contribute to its waging. In the short run,
                    they didn't want to sever all ties with the Vietnamese with whom they felt some
                    resonance in wars of independence. Somewhat as a paradox, in the longer run they
                    looked upon Vietnam as a potential rival to what they regarded as Indonesian
                    natural leadership in Southeast Asia. They wanted to retain the ability to be
                    credible with Vietnam after the war.</p>
                <p>Later, when the war was over and I was country director for Indonesia and its
                    neighbors, we provided constant reassurance to Southeast Asia that while we'd
                    lost the Vietnam War, it did not mean the withdrawal of the U.S. from the
                    region. We sought to maintain confidence that the U.S. would remain a major
                    regional player and be a counterweight to China. There was regional concern that
                    we might pull back. Singapore PM Lee Kwan Yu, for example, became more amenable,
                    and offered port calls and ship repair facilities. By the way, we didn't use the
                    word “lost” then.</p>
                <p>Q: Oh, yes. Well, you knew Japan. How about the role of Japan while you were
                    there? Was Japan our rival economically, or were we seeing Japan as a
                    partner?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: We saw Japan as a partner which we wanted more engaged in order to bear
                    more of the assistance “burden”. It was during my tenure either then or later as
                    country director that Japan's bilateral level of foreign aid surpassed ours. Up
                    until that point, our mantras were about Japanese burden sharing, introducing
                    them to a broader view of the world, and contributing to stability in Southeast
                    Asia - all that good stuff. Once their aid exceeded ours, we began to realize
                    that the Indonesians knew it, too. We had to begin to remind them that we were
                    their political as well as well as economic key supporter. That Japanese firms
                    should not be given priority over American firms. Japanese firms, of course, did
                    the informal deals the Indonesian power structure wanted.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: The Singaporean-Indonesian relationship was prickly at best. Both sides
                    suffered from superiority-inferiority complexes. Indonesia perceived Singapore
                    as a small Chinese island state which thought itself too smart by half and which
                    siphoned off trade and financial services which should have come to Indonesia. A
                    good deal of Indonesian trade was smuggled into and out of Singapore. In
                    retaliation, the Indonesians built a large port and trade entrepot on an island
                    visible from Singapore. Batang, I think.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>The history of confrontasi, the undeclared virtual war between Indonesia and
                    Singapore during the Sukarno era, still reverberated. A major shock to the
                    Singapore-Indonesian relationship when I was there was the Singaporean execution
                    of several Indonesian marines who had been arrested in Singapore during
                    confrontasi and had been in jail for years. Suharto made a personal appeal for
                    clemency to PM Lee Kuan Yew to no avail. Working things out “the Asian way”
                    failed. A great loss of face for Suharto. It was never forgotten.</p>

                    be ambassador to the Sudan, asked his staff for a list of Deputy Chief of
                    Mission (DCM) prospects. He thought he should live by the system he had run. My
                    name was on the list. I had never met him nor was interviewed, but, all of a
                    sudden, I was to be DCM in Khartoum. However, as you know, Ambassador Noel and
                    my predecessor, Curt Moore, were tragically assassinated just as I arrived in
                    Khartoum. I thus became instant charge d'affaires a.i.</p>
                <p>The definitive story of the assassinations, the trials in the Sudan and their
                    aftermath is in the book Assassination in Khartoum (1993), authored by our
                    former colleague, David Korn. His book is the only public account on which those
                    of us involved cooperated because we agreed earlier not to do so unless the two
                    widows approved. Lucille Noel and Sally Moore trusted David, who had known
                    Curt.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did this happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: In March, 1973.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this hit you?</hi>

                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>FRITTS: The assassinations or the assignment?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The assignment first.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, Audrey and I were surprised and pleased, but also somewhat
                    disappointed. We had been looking to enjoy more of Indonesia. As always, the
                    first year at a post is the toughest. You have to learn the work, develop
                    contacts, and start to become productive. Vacations are rare. The first year is
                    also filled with challenges for family members. That period was now behind us.
                    Our two girls were doing well in school; Audrey's and my Bahasa were starting to
                    be fluent. Then bang! We were to yank the girls out of school and go to a
                    totally new continent - Africa.</p>
                <p>However, like all Foreign Service families, we knew how to pick up and go. We
                    followed a philosophy that our kids also knew that our “home” was not a place;
                    our “home” was anywhere we were together. When I had a new assignment, Audrey
                    and I would convene a little ritual. Susan and Robin would be asked to get
                    cushions. We would then sit in a circle on the floor zabutan-style. I'd announce
                    our next post and we would discuss the changes. Nothing democratic about it; no
                    options. However, the kids were used to it and, maybe, even kind of liked it.
                    They knew they were losing friends, but also had learned there would be new
                    ones. The March timing was bad - they knew they'd be out of school for awhile.
                    But we made a fast trip to Bali, packed up, and left.Of course I was pleased to
                    be named DCM. It was a plum career step and I was young for the job. I knew
                    nothing about Africa or the Sudan. Zero. But the country and Nile confluence
                    sounded interesting and even a bit romantic.</p>
                <p>It was to be a direct transfer from Jakarta to Khartoum, but I raised a minor
                    fuss that I wanted to go via Washington for Department consultations. Besides
                    not wanting to be ignorant, I also knew I had to know the players at home.
                    Reluctantly, the Department finally agreed. As it turned out, it may have saved
                    my life.</p>
                <p>When I arrived in Washington, the State experts said, “Oh, we can't tell you much
                    about the Sudan. Ambassador Noel's the real expert. He'll bring you up to speed
                    much better out there than we can here.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what did you pick up on consultations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: That I would be very fortunate to have Cleo Noel as an ambassador.
                    Besides being an expert, he was a respected professional, a man of honor and
                    integrity, and he'd been genuinely welcomed by the Sudanese Government and
                    friends from his previous tours in Khartoum.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>Also lauded was the departing DCM, Curt Moore, who was a close friend of
                    Ambassador Noel. He was also highly respected as a person and as a professional.
                    He had been chief of the U.S. interests section (part of the Dutch embassy) in
                    Khartoum for several years until the restoration of bilateral relations a few
                    months before. Ambassador Noel was now the first full-fledged U.S. ambassador in
                    Khartoum since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the policy side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: The Sudan, as part of Arab unity, had broken relations with the U.S. in
                    the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. But now it had become the first Arab state to restore
                    relations. The U.S. hoped Egypt would follow suit. The Sudan was thus viewed as
                    a wedge to reestablish the American diplomatic presence in the Middle East. Our
                    goal was to nurture the Sudanese relationship to serve as a model for other Arab
                    states also to resume full relations with the U.S. The process would entail
                    building mutual confidence via political consultation, initiating an aid
                    program, attracting American private investment, enhancing trade and cultural
                    ties, and otherwise indicating that a formal, working, friendly relationship
                    with the U.S. was beneficial. The Sudan was also not inconsequential in its own
                    right. It's the largest country in Africa, is on the strategic Red Sea near the
                    Horn of Africa, and borders eight African countries, including Egypt, Libya and
                    then-Zaire now the Congo - again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did things develop on consultations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Tragically. I was in the Department of Commerce on, I guess, about March
                    1 when I was called out of a meeting by the secretary on the Sudan desk who said
                    I was to return to the Department immediately, but she was not permitted to tell
                    me why. I said, “Immediately?” She said, “Yes, immediately.” So I broke off the
                    meeting, went back, and found out that Ambassador Noel and Curt Moore had been
                    taken hostage by Black September Organization (BSO) terrorists, while attending
                    a farewell reception for Curt Moore at the Saudi Embassy in Khartoum. This was,
                    I think, the first ambassadorial hostage situation of what became a string of
                    hostage and terrorist situations to this day. I found out that the Principals
                    were meeting in the Operations Center, to which I repaired immediately. Bill
                    Macomber, then under secretary for management, had convened a task force there
                    and the ongoing discussion was what to do and how to do it. With all my vast
                    Sudan experience, I was, of course, but a fly on the wall.</p>
                <p>Macomber finally said, “Well, we'll leave right away for Egypt and see what
                    develops”. The idea was use Air Force transport, fly to Cairo, and determine
                    what to do based on the evolving situation. Macomber envisioned guiding any
                    Sudanese negotiations with the terrorists and wanted to be closer to the
                    action.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>Macomber then said, “Who's going to go with me?” He checked off various names of
                    people who were or were not in the room, altogether a small group of about six.
                    He hadn't named me and probably had no idea I was the new DCM. He knew my face
                    from other activities, but no one in the meeting had paid any attention to me -
                    what did I know? Macomber got up briskly to leave. I intercepted him and said,
                    “Mr. Secretary, I'm to be the new DCM - Curt Moore's successor. I need to be on
                    that plane.” “Okay,” he said, “I'm leaving in two hours. Can you do it?” Of
                    course, I said, “Yes.”</p>
                <p>Luckily, being in transit, I was staying across the street in the Columbia Plaza
                    apartments. I just threw stuff into a suitcase and garment bag. My wife and
                    daughters were visiting my parents in Florida and due up in a day or two. I
                    tried to call her, but no answer, so I left a note. My brother, purely by
                    chance, was in town on business from Atlanta. I called him to say what was up,
                    that I had hidden the room key in shrubbery outside Columbia Plaza, and to
                    collect whatever I left behind until Audrey returned. I hustled back to the
                    Department and boarded the van for Andrews Air Force Base.</p>
                <p>Q: So what was your impression at the meeting? As you said, you were a “fly on
                    the wall” at this crisis session. Did you feel the group was floundering or knew
                    what was going on?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, in any situation like that the information is incomplete. There
                    were rumors within rumors from Embassies Khartoum and Cairo, the media, and
                    intelligence sources. Many conflicted with others. What Macomber wanted to do
                    was get in close on the ground, be briefed, gain direct knowledge, and decide
                    how to have an impact - perfectly reasonable. Substance aside, we did not then
                    have the instant communications of today. Our only real time link was a
                    specially setup teletype (TTY) projection onto a wall screen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Air Force respond well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: In truth, the Air Force was not used to being called up on short notice
                    to provide an airplane for a State Department official and team to go anywhere.
                    They said no aircraft would be available for hours. But Macomber was a very
                    impatient, high-profile, hard-nosed person, as you may recall, and raised Cain
                    with the White House. As it turned, the only plane immediately available was the
                    President's 707 Special Command Flight to be used in response to a nuclear
                    attack. One was always aloft, but it landed at Andrews for us. It was quite
                    spiffy, with all sorts of radar consoles, excellent communications, and some
                    very nicely appointed seats. But you can imagine the Air Force was bent out of
                    shape big-time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>FRITTS: - to have, you know, a group of State Department people preempting their
                    airborne strategic deterrent. And they didn't let it last very long. We flew
                    from Andrews Air Force Base to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, a distance of,
                    maybe, 100 miles? And half the trip was circling and dumping fuel over the
                    ocean. We then sat at Dover for several hours awaiting another plane, but the
                    Air Force could say they had gotten us started. So while Macomber got us up in
                    the air, all right, we didn't go anywhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>After several hours, an Air Force C-141 arrived and flew us from Dover to
                    Frankfort, Germany where, after another layover, we flew on to Cairo. But the
                    C-141 was useless for any planning because of the noise level. They were large
                    cargo aircraft configured with a few passenger benches. We had to wear earplugs.
                    There was no way to discuss issues, to plan, to receive updates or work out
                    plans. Occasionally Macomber would be called to the cockpit, where somebody at
                    State would brief him on the latest with a few sentences. He would return and
                    try to shout to us over the din. He finally gave up on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern at the time about the White House
                        reaction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Not that I knew; all that came about later. The priority was to get into
                    the area, find out the facts, and react. I don't know what Macomber was
                    receiving or doing at that time on White House or State press guidance. The
                    White House issue and other controversies came up later.</p>
                <p>But I'll go on with the story. When we arrived in Cairo, our U.S. Interests
                    Section Chief, Jerry Greene (?), was at planeside. He told Macomber that the
                    latest word from Khartoum was that the Sudanese were negotiating with the BSO
                    terrorists and that the hostages - our two plus several foreign ambassadors and
                    the honorary Belgian charge d'affaires a.i. - and the terrorists would be flown
                    to Cairo under safe conduct and all released to Egyptian authorities. Macomber
                    thus decided to stay in Cairo to advise the Egyptians. He didn't want to be en
                    route to Khartoum if the hostages and terrorists were en route to Cairo. In the
                    meantime, to augment the staff in Khartoum, he sent Alan Bergstrom, a former
                    political officer in Khartoum, and me onward to buttress the embassy. A
                    commercial flight in Cairo had been held pending Macomber's arrival. Alan and I
                    boarded and took off for Khartoum.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>Unknown to us, a haboob or dust storm, had swept across Khartoum. By the time we
                    arrived in the area, visibility had been reduced to zero with dangerous winds. I
                    realized something was wrong because as we got closer and closer to Khartoum and
                    lower and lower, the plane began to buck violently. I sensed we made several
                    unsuccessful approaches, but after one particular wrenching gyration, we finally
                    landed. An embassy officer, Ed Braun, was there to meet us and related that
                    everyone in the terminal had hit the deck at one point when our plane emerged
                    out of the gloom lined up on the lights of the terminal rather than the runway.
                    We then went to the embassy in downtown Khartoum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived at the embassy, did you know what you
                        were gointo do, or was it just to be there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Just to be there and play it by ear. The embassy occupied the upper
                    floors of a commercial office building adjoined by others on the main street.
                    Because of the haboob, power was out and also, I think, the Sudanese Government
                    cut power to the Saudi embassy and the area included us. I thus climbed five or
                    six floors up the back steps, carrying my suitcase and garment bag over my
                    shoulder. The only lighting on the stairway was battery-operated dual emergency
                    lights - very dim. I finally came to the floor where the embassy began. The
                    administrative officer, Sandy Sanderson, was standing there with his glasses on
                    a string hanging around his neck. I couldn't quite see his face as he was back
                    lighted by the emergency lamps, but I could tell he was crying. He said, “We've
                    heard there was gunfire in the Saudi embassy. They may be dead. You're in
                    charge.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good God!... So what does one do? Out of breath at the top
                        othe stairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, I asked whether we had confirmed the deaths and, if not, how could
                    we do it? His answer was uncertain. I said that finding out was the top priority
                    for the embassy and Washington. He then sent a Marine to advise several of our
                    embassy officers who were monitoring events outside the Saudi embassy.</p>
                <p>My next thought was how could I be most useful? Others might behave differently,
                    but I decided it was not to come in and take a high profile approach. I told
                    Sanderson to remain in charge as he had been for the past two days, that I
                    didn't know the embassy, the staff or even the city. Nor did I know Sudanese
                    government officials nor they me. The American embassy staff was very small -
                    only a half-dozen American officers, two or three secretaries - all in shock and
                    without rest. Most of our Sudanese FSNs (Foreign Service Nationals) were
                    hunkered down at their homes. I decided the best thing I could do initially was
                    just do whatever was helpful.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>You'll recall that when I discussed the Operations Center, I said the Department
                    and embassy Khartoum were linked by a crude direct TTY line that printed letter
                    by letter. It was very slow and limited to only several sentences at a time.
                    While talking with Sandy and others, I saw the TTY keyboard and small screen on
                    a table with a chair in the corridor. It was unmanned and only glanced at
                    intermittently when an officer happened to pass by. I knew how thirsty the
                    Department was for information and its frustration with the dead time between
                    questions and responses. So I said, “I'll start with this.” Because of
                    consultations, I knew who was who in the Department and thought I knew what they
                    needed or would need. I manned the TTY for most of the next 36 hours. It became
                    our embassy cockpit. It also freed up those who needed to be operational with
                    the Foreign Ministry, the police, the Army, the media etc. I developed an
                    increasingly in-depth dialogue with the Department, including sets of short
                    evaluations, impressions, what next, etc. Versions were also being passed to
                    Macomber who was still in Cairo.</p>
                <p>The haboob was still howling. They normally last hours; this one lasted three
                    days. Even the following noon it was black. Dust and grit were everywhere - in
                    your eyes and teeth. Every flat surface was layered. We were covered in gritty
                    dust. The dim embassy lights were still battery powered. It was a scene from
                    hell.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, evidence accumulated that Noel and Moore had been killed, but no one
                    had been inside the Saudi Embassy and actually seen the bodies, so it wasn't
                    definitive. No one at our embassy wanted to accept that they had, in fact, been
                    killed. Finally, it seemed to me time to bite the bullet and I typed out a
                    message to the effect that they were “presumed” dead and future USG actions
                    should be based on that premise. I understand the reaction back at the
                    Operations Center was emotional.</p>
                <p>After further negotiations, the Sudanese gained access to the Saudi Embassy and
                    viewed the bodies. The remaining diplomatic hostages were released and the
                    Sudanese took custody of the BSO terrorists. The honorary Belgian diplomat,
                    half-Egyptian, had also been killed, probably, we found out, as part of a past
                    personal issue with one of the terrorists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What else do you recall from that awful time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>FRITTS: One human vignette I recall vividly is that the BSO operatives
                    “permitted” Noel and Moore to write “last words” to their wives, who were
                    together throughout at the residence. The murdered mens' notes, sealed in
                    incongruously embossed Saudi embassy envelopes, were given to Sanderson by the
                    Foreign Ministry. He asked me if I would deliver them? I said, “Sandy, I've
                    never met Mrs. Noel and Mrs. Moore in my life. I'm even here as a live
                    substitute for Moore. They've got enough to handle without factoring me in. You
                    know them well, they know you. It's better if you deliver the letters.” He left
                    for the task in tears. He returned to say how appreciative the wives were for
                    all everyone was doing, including me by name. And he commented that neither wife
                    had shown any tears.</p>
                <p>A couple other vignettes also stick in my mind, such as the overnighvigil.</p>
                <p>After much too long, the bodies were retrieved from the Saudi Embassy basement,
                    where they had been gunned down against a wall. Sandy identified them and he and
                    Braun assisted in the preparation of the remains and putting them into the
                    caskets that every Embassy has for emergencies. They lay “in state” in one of
                    our embassy houses overnight and the next day. We had a Marine Security Guard in
                    Dress Blues in formal attendance plus the American and ambassadorial flags. It
                    was like a wake - embassy officers and Sudanese staff would come and go and come
                    again. I think a few VIP Sudanese stopped by as well, even though the condolence
                    book was at the embassy.</p>
                <p>Then there was the departure ceremony. With the haboob over, Air Force One or
                    Two, which had staged to Cairo, arrived with Macomber. We and the Sudanese
                    arranged a tarmac exit ceremony for the coffins and the widows attended by the
                    government and diplomatic corps. In one of those poignant paradoxes you often
                    see in Africa, the coffins, carried by the Marine Guards with the wives, me and
                    the other embassy officers following, were accompanied by Sudanese troops
                    slow-marching to a Sudanese military bagpipe band playing Auld Lang Syne as a
                    dirge. I never hear that tune at New Year's, but what it saddens me. In
                    Washington, there was a memorial service at the National Presbyterian Cathedral,
                    which Audrey attended to represent the embassy. She met Lucille Noel and Sally
                    Moore there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did Macomber do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: He only overnighted. Of course, he met with President Nimeiri and other
                    key officials. I attended, but Bergstrom did the reporting cables. Nimeiri and
                    the Sudanese were incensed. They felt the attack had besmirched their
                    international reputation and personally insulted them. That Qadhafi was the main
                    force behind the attack, at least in part to punish them for renewing formal
                    U.S. ties. Macomber's emphasis was on the trial and punishment of the murderers
                    and we thought we had firm assurances. A trial and conviction of anti-American
                    Arab terrorists by an Arab state would be a first in the Middle East.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>On a personal note, I had a memorable “exit meeting” with Macomber. All of us had
                    been sleeping, such as it was, in the embassy. I used a dust ladened sofa in
                    Ambassador Noel's office. With the new arrivals, every sofa and chair was
                    occupied. For Macomber, we rigged up an actual bed (sort of) in our tiny
                    dispensary.</p>
                <p>He would leave the next morning. I went to see him just as he was about to nod
                    off after days of precious little sleep. “What guidance do you have for me?”, I
                    asked. And he said something like, “What guidance do you want?” And I said,
                    “Well, in these circumstances, how should I approach managing the embassy?” He
                    replied, wonderfully, “However you see fit.”</p>
                <p>You know, there's an “in box” exercise for Foreign Service applicants where they
                    arrive at a post to replace an officer who's died suddenly. They have to go
                    through the contents of an in-box and determine priorities. Well, I now had two
                    in-boxes and it was for real.</p>
                <p>Among the papers in Noel's box was a photo, taken and developed at the embassy,
                    of his taking the oath as ambassador the day of his capture by the desk where I
                    now sat. He had come to the Sudan on an interim appointment and been confirmed
                    by the Senate in absentia. Curt Moore had delivered the oath of office. The two
                    men and their wives were wrapped in laughter and friendship. Hours later, both
                    men were dead. If I had arrived in Khartoum directly from Jakarta, I might have
                    been with them.</p>
                <p>I learned later that Moore had possibly been at least vaguely aware of being
                    under surveillance, but had discounted it. Noel had also been advised to be
                    cautious, but, with his deep experience in Khartoum, had said that very day,
                    “Nothing will happen to me in the Sudan”. He was right about the Sudanese, but
                    wrong about the BSO, Libya and, maybe, Yasser Arafat.</p>
                <p>Among the papers in Moore's box was a hand-written welcome letter to me. It ended
                    with “So at the close of three and one-half of the finest years of my life, I
                    welcome you to Khartoum and hope you will be able to make the same statement
                    when you leave.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how did you decide to approach managing the
                        embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Carefully. The small embassy was in psychological shock and depression.
                    Although the Americans did not know Cleo Noel well, they knew his reputation.
                    His few months at post had been impressively reassuring. They virtually revered
                    Curt Moore. The Sudanese FSNs appreciated both men as friends of the Sudan and
                    everyone knew that Noel and Moore were as close as brothers. The embassy was
                    shattered - absolutely shattered.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>As noted, I'd never before been in the Sudan or Africa nor had anything to do
                    with the Arabic world or Israel-Palestine. I'd had only a few shallow days in
                    Washington. I had no presumed credibility by country or regional experience. But
                    I was now the senior officer at post. I spent nights going through Noel's and
                    Moore's working files and the embassy files in-depth back six months to a year.
                    A good deal of the sensitive stuff had not been shared with others and I could
                    piece some of it together. What was most irreplaceable, of course, were their
                    contacts and access gained over the years and previous tours. The political
                    officer, Sam Peale, was outstanding. He had become a close friend of Moore and
                    was devastated by his death, but soldiered on. Next senior to me was Sandy
                    Sanderson, the administrative officer, who had a lot of people skills, but
                    hadn't handled policy matters. The USIS director did great work with the influx
                    of Western media. He also felt and expressed readily and often that he should be
                    Charge as his USIS rank was higher.</p>
                <p>The first week or two was just terrible; each day worse than the one preceding.
                    Aside from lack of knowledge and contacts, it was a challenge to resuscitate and
                    inspire officers from such a trauma. I set initial personal and embassy goals,
                    at first day to day and then longer. I soon realized the American officers found
                    solace in focus. They also had been bonded by a crisis that encompassed me. It
                    was March and they began to respond to my game plan of rendering honor to the
                    fallen by having the embassy rebound as a fully functioning professional entity
                    by July 4, 1973. If successful, we could top it off symbolically with the first
                    formal July 4 celebration in an Arabic state since 1967. If we could do that, I
                    would have done what I could as Charge. The embassy would then be a proven,
                    ready and able vehicle for a new ambassador with shoulder patch to move forward.
                    Sounds rehearsed, but it was embedded in my mind and recallable today.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, I consider Khartoum the formative period in my Foreign Service
                    career. It justified the approach I had always taken of wanting responsibility
                    and across-the-board experience. Frankly, when I left the Sudan, I felt I could
                    handle any task the Foreign Service could assign.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you modify policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>FRITTS: Circumstance modified policy. Our top goal was for the Sudanese to try
                    and convict the murderers. I knew that task over time would become complicated
                    and as a new Charge, I wouldn't have much clout with the Sudanese. But I did
                    represent the USG and the Sudanese knew that my reports would influence
                    Washington. I also knew we were handicapped in not having the contacts to keep
                    track of what we didn't know - the crucial behind-the-scenes stuff. We'd have to
                    build, drawing in part on the receptive sympathy of many top Sudanese.
                    Officially, our “carrot” was a USG willingness to build a mutually rewarding
                    “example” of U.S.-Sudanese relations. The implied “stick” would be to render the
                    Sudan again an outcast from the West, a recent situation sufficiently unpleasant
                    that the Sudan had broken ranks and reestablished U.S. relations.</p>
                <p>However, my first task was to reconstruct the captures. I interviewed as many
                    participants as I could, including Sudanese officials, army and the police, plus
                    the diplomats at the ill-fated reception. The Saudi ambassador had decamped to
                    Saudi Arabia and the Jordanian charge, as I recall, was disappointing. Scared, I
                    think. In contrast, the Soviet ambassador was very forthcoming and detailed,
                    including his escape over the garden wall. He surprisingly and outspokenly
                    guaranteed the full support of the Soviet Government to punish the violations of
                    diplomatic immunity and embassy sovereignty. Didn't happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find President Nimeiri?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: As a newly arrived charge, I never had direct meetings with him, although
                    I met directly with the Vice President, the Army Chief of Staff and a cluster of
                    others. My main contact was with the permanent secretary in the Ministry of
                    Foreign Affairs, a Fadl Obeid, and occasionally with the mercurial, somewhat
                    anti-American foreign minister, Mansour Khaled. Fadl Obeid and I were not
                    personally close, but we grew to respect each other. He was a decent man trying
                    to do decent work under difficult circumstances. Nimeiri, of course, was caught
                    between an American hammer and an Arab anvil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you said the number-one issue was what to do with
                        thassassins.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Absolutely. Our goal was for the Sudanese Government to put the
                    terrorists on trial, convict and punish them. It was an issue of principle and
                    retribution, but also considered useful as an international precedent,
                    particularly for other Arab states. The Sudanese Government started out strong
                    and ended, over a year later, compromising and weak. Although finally convicted,
                    the punishments didn't fit the crime. By that time, I had been reassigned to
                    Kigali, Rwanda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll come to the punishments, but tell us a bit about the
                        triafirst.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>FRITTS: It was a tortuous process. The Sudanese's Government's initial chagrin
                    and outrage became progressively modified by internal and foreign policy
                    concerns. The first step, which took months, was a magisterial inquiry, sort of
                    like a grand jury. After fits and starts and a series of our demarches to the
                    government, the magistrate finally lodged charges of murder against the
                    principal BSO assassins.</p>
                <p>We covered the inquiry indirectly. I thought it better not to have me or an
                    American in the room to monitor it. At that time, English was still acceptable
                    and widely used professionally. But even for Arabists, trial language would be
                    specialized. Instead, an FSN attended and our reports drew from his notes, plus
                    surprisingly good coverage by the media, some of it Western. I also debriefed
                    selected Sudanese attendees and other sources, sometimes while ostensibly
                    playing tennis or other innocuous activities. However, our FSN was threatened
                    several times and we needed an expert fix on the Sudanese legal system, even
                    though it was still quite British. We wanted to know how to challenge the
                    continual delays which were often couched, true or not and increasingly not, as
                    procedural rather than political.</p>
                <p>I thus hired a Sudanese lawyer who attended the process privately. He would visit
                    me at home on the legal issues and background maneuvering. He would also suggest
                    occasional initiatives I could undertake and sometimes did.</p>
                <p>Inconceivably, the Department wouldn't authorize me to pay him for some reason
                    and told me to void the contract! He was, of course, in personal jeopardy should
                    his role become known. I ignored the Department, told him to trust me, and we'd
                    work it out. As it turned out, I was reassigned and found out only months later
                    he had never been paid. I was incensed and made it my business from Kigali to
                    hype the shame aspect. Eventually, it was done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the conviction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Months further, after I had gone to Rwanda, they were convicted in a
                    trial on charges of murder. The good news was that our foremost policy goal had
                    been met - the conviction of anti-American terrorists in an Arabic state. The
                    sentence was life imprisonment, which the Sudanese Supreme Court commuted to X
                    years. The bad news was truly bad. They were eventually turned over
                    surreptitiously to the PLO to “impose the sentence” and spirited out by plane to
                    Cairo. I think then-Ambassador Brewer only found out about it after the fact.
                    The USG pressured the Egyptians not to release them and they were put in a form
                    of progressively loose house arrest in a Nile mansion. Eventually, they
                    evaporated. A travesty!</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>One of the controversies in later years was that the White House and State eased
                    the pressure, partly for Middle East foreign policy reasons and partly because
                    the major State principals were progressively transferred in a normal career
                    sequence. Kissinger is cited as having a bigger picture in mind and State as
                    viewing the matter as “an” issue, but not “the” issue it had been. I can't speak
                    to that as I was in Kigali well before the trial ended.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As for controversies, I earlier asked about the role of
                        PresidenNixon...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: It's argued that President Nixon's public announcement, while Noel and
                    Moore were still held and alive, that the U.S. would not negotiate with
                    terrorists for hostages precipitated their execution.</p>
                <p>I have no proof either way. Nobody does. However, my slant is different. I think
                    they were doomed at the outset in that the operation was undertaken expressly to
                    kill Moore as a way to reestablish BSO credibility in the wake of a BSO fiasco
                    in the takeover of the Japanese embassy in Kuala Lumpur several months
                    previously. Those hostages had been successfully released and there was
                    widespread international media comment that the BSO was a paper tiger. In
                    contrast, Cleo Noel was taken by chance. The BSO attacked Moore's farewell
                    reception and Noel just happened to be there. The BSO found that they actually
                    had two Americans rather than one. If I had not argued for consultations in
                    Washington, it might have been three.</p>
                <p>I also think Moore was a victim of mistaken identity. As the terrorists ran
                    through the Saudi Embassy, I understand they were shouting for “Moore from
                    Jordan, Moore from Jordan”. I think they confused him with a Curt Moore who had
                    been an AID accountant in Jordan when the PLO and BSO were rolled up by King
                    Hussein. In their CIA conspiracy world view, they assumed the Curt Moore in the
                    Sudan had been under cover in Jordan. Either they made that mistake or their
                    superiors conjured it up to justify the operation and murder.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the role of Yasser Arafat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Another continuing controversy. About a decade later when I was in
                    Consular Affairs, the Rand Corporation was commissioned, possibly by a
                    Congressional committee, to do a study on Yasser Arafat, including his and the
                    PLO's role in the assassinations, as a prelude to a U.S. policy decision on
                    whether or not to grant a visa for Arafat to attend his first United Nations
                    General Assembly.</p>
                <p>The terrorists were in touch with their headquarters by radio and one belief is
                    that Yasser Arafat personally gave the order to execute Moore and Noel. Others
                    say the information is inconclusive. Some aver he was possibly in the room and
                    could have nodded. I don't know. We'll probably never know, unless someone who
                    was there talks and, even then, we won't be sure.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>In contrast, there's no controversy about the role of Qadhafi and the Libyans.
                    The arms were brought in through the Libyan pouch in Khartoum. The Libyan charge
                    helped plan it and departed Khartoum hurriedly the day before the operation went
                    down. Several other Libyans were also involved.</p>
                <p>Q: The very soft treatment of the assassins - what did this do to the embassy? I
                    only met Curt Moore a couple of times when we were in Personnel at the same time
                    - but I know that for years I felt very bitter about Nimeiri and his role in not
                    coming up... Just as a Foreign Service officer, I just felt he had proved to be
                    unfriendly to the United States.</p>
                <p>FRITTS: I think the widely held view in the Foreign Service was not so much to
                    blame Nimeiri, but to blame the Department and, particularly, Kissinger for not
                    keeping enough pressure on the Sudanese. But I was gone and don't have any
                    personal knowledge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the embassy function normally during the trials?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Yes, we pursued our policy of demonstrating that the restoration of full
                    relations with the U.S. was a useful thing. We ratcheted up our official
                    presence and programs. We assigned an AID officer as the precursor of an AID
                    office. A number of State-DOD delegations began to negotiate military assistance
                    agreements. Our USIA operation expanded. We had several Congressional (CODEL)
                    visits, which had not occurred for years. We encouraged American private foreign
                    investment and the Sudanese doors were open. General Electric (GE) looked things
                    over as did several smaller American exploration oil firms. We initiated closer
                    and more sensitive political exchanges. We thus began to restore and do the
                    panoply of political, economic, commercial and public diplomacy kinds of things
                    that go with friendly bilateral relations. We wanted Sudan to serve as a model
                    for the area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you augmented by anybody from Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Not really. A security guy came in from our embassy in South Africa. He
                    revamped our security effectively and sensibly. But the then-embassy, in the top
                    floors of an adjoined downtown office building, was completely indefensible. We
                    had occasional troublesome hostile surveillance and military escorts. We didn't
                    travel much outside Khartoum. We couldn't travel south to Juba, for example. We
                    were very chary in our public activities, but the small staff measured up
                    extremely well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the south in revolt?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>FRITTS: Providentially, no. A big plus was that the Sudanese and the Southerners
                    had just signed an agreement in Addis Ababa to end the conflict and integrate
                    the Southerners into the Government and the army. Hopes were high. We were
                    involved in trying to make the agreement work. Sam Peal was in close touch with
                    the Southerners. And initial signs were quite positive. As I made my official
                    rounds, there were high-ranking Dinkas, including, I think, a Dinka Minister of
                    Economic Affairs, whose name I've forgotten, Bol, maybe. Ethiopian Emperor Haile
                    Selassie was in Khartoum not long afterward to bless the agreement. I remember
                    at the airport ceremony being surprised at how short the Lion of Judah was in
                    person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Sudanese Government like at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: The Nimeiri government was more moderate than it eventually became. In
                    restoring relations with the United States, Nimeiri took a lot of heat from the
                    radical Arab states and from militant domestic groups, such as the Islamic
                    Brotherhood. The Sudan needed an opening to the West to restore economic
                    momentum and the U.S. was responding readily.</p>
                <p>As a people, the Sudanese have a very high sense of personal honor and the
                    government felt its national honor had been besmirched. Thus, there was a high
                    sense of acute embarrassment. Moore and Noel were also widely respected and
                    known. Indeed, there was a gratifying initial outpouring of Sudanese indirect
                    public expressions of embarrassment and bereavement, especially from those who
                    had known the two men for years. The government believed the assassinations had
                    been designed specifically to embarrass it. The Sudan and Libya had had
                    difficult relations for years, including border clashes. On the other hand, the
                    government did not want to be perceived as giving in to the Americans in any way
                    that could be used further against them. The regime felt itself already exposed
                    and vulnerable to overthrow by conservative Islamic groups, such as the Muslim
                    Brotherhood and the charismatic Sadiq al-Mahdi. Anti-government demonstrations
                    were periodic. Several occurred across the roundabout from us. If large and
                    serious enough, the Sudanese Army would fire live ammunition over the
                    demonstrators' heads. They'd flee leaving their slipper shoes behind which we'd
                    count and divide by two for crowd size.</p>
                <p>Q: How about the Sudanese Government? What was your impression of their
                    abilities? The Sudan had been the crown jewel of the British colonial service,
                    and I was wondering how</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, the tragedy of the Sudan is the continuing saga of what might have
                    been and should be a viable, prosperous and accomplished country. Although
                    mostly desert, there is massive irrigation potential from the Blue and White
                    Niles. It has excellent tourism prospects by evoking its African-Arab meld,
                    Victorian imagery, ancient monuments in Meroe, and the Red Sea coast. And
                    there's some oil. Plus a huge territory - the largest in Africa. And, at that
                    time in Khartoum, the still functioning remnants of a good educational system,
                    and fairly wide knowledge of internationally useful English. Many Sudanese
                    agronomists and engineers were proud of their training as graduates of the
                    University of Arizona and Arizona State. The peoples were impressive in
                    character as well as skill. I've often said that of the countries I know
                    something about, the Sudanese and the Burmese are the two that least deserve the
                    governments they've got. But the Sudan just never has worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about some of the more militant Arab countries, like
                        Libya,Syria, and all? What sort of roles were they playing in the
                        Sudan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: With the exception of malevolent Libya, not much. Khartoum was a somewhat
                    disdained African backwater by the “pure” Arabs. I had limited contact with
                    militant Arab diplomats since we had no official relations. The militants were
                    actively working against our interests in general and on the BSO trial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Egypt? What sort of role was Egypt
                        playing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Egyptian-Sudanese relations are historically strained, probably since
                    Pharonic times and, more recently, from the Sudan being the junior partner in
                    the colonial Anglo-Egyptian condominium. Egypt was closely watching the
                    Sudanese-U.S. resumption of relations. If it worked out in Khartoum, then Cairo
                    would probably be next.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But then at that time, Egypt wasn't playing... We didn't
                        looupon Egypt as being a partner in helping us get somewhere.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, Egypt was a big Middle East player and, even though whad only an
                    Interests Section in Cairo, it was a big operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how long were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>FRITTS: Ambassador Bill Brewer came out later in the fall and I took my station
                    as DCM. After a few months, it was time for home leave. I took receipt of a
                    powerboat from Beirut to use on the Nile on our return and put it unused on
                    skids in the front yard. Audrey and I got on the aircraft with our children at
                    the usual midnight cooler hour so the plane would have enough lift and we flew
                    off towards the United States. We anticipated a wonderful home leave with the
                    crisis and tensions behind us. Our family was always quite firmly bonded
                    together. As the plane took off, Audrey and I held hands, said how much we liked
                    the Sudan, and we would have a lot of fun on our return.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: We arrived in Washington and went to a Foreign Service cocktail party at
                    a friend's house. We hadn't been there more than five minutes when the FSO
                    hostess gave me a squeeze and said, “Congratulations.” I said, “Why?” She said,
                    “Because - well, don't you know? You're becoming an ambassador.” I said,
                    “Where?” She said, “Rwanda.” I said, “How do you know?” She said, “I saw it in
                    Personnel.” I said, “Beats me.” That ruined the party and our night's sleep.</p>
                <p>The next day I went to the African bureau executive director who said, “Welcome
                    back, you did a great job,” all that stuff, and I said, “What's this I hear
                    about Rwanda?” “Oh,” he said, “You're being nominated as ambassador to Rwanda.”
                    I said, “I don't want to be ambassador to Rwanda. I want to go back and be DCM
                    in Khartoum.” And he said, “Well, you'd better talk to David Newsom about that.”
                    David Newsom was the assistant secretary for African affairs. I had only met him
                    to shake his hand during consultations. I couldn't get an appointment with him
                    till the next morning. He was one of the most respected and admired senior
                    officers in the Foreign Service and later became undersecretary for political
                    affairs. But I was angry, thought a transfer dumb, and that I was needed in
                    Khartoum.</p>
                <p>Audrey and I had another sleepless night.</p>
                <p>Newsom is, by nature, calm, contained and poised. I went through my litany
                    more-or-less professionally. “Well,” he said, “You're being named ambassador
                    because of your wonderful work in Khartoum.” I said, “I don't want to be
                    ambassador in Kigali. Khartoum needs me. I've put the embassy back together.
                    There's a new ambassador there. Things are shaped up. I want to go back there
                    and do my job as DCM.” And he said slowly, “You're going to be ambassador to
                    Rwanda.” And I said, “What if I refuse it?” And he said very slowly, “If I were
                    you, I would think rather hard about that before doing so.” And I said, “Well,
                    when does the request for agr�ment go out?” He said, “Agr�ment is back already.”
                    I think my jaw dropped. “Agr�ment is completed and I've never even been
                    informed?” “Well,” he said, “I guess there was some oversight.”</p>

                <p>FRITTS: So we went to Rwanda.</p>
                <p>Q: You've said how you felt about this. The whole idea in the Foreign Service is
                    becoming an ambassador. It's a key career thing, but at the same time, this is
                    not the way to get it.</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, I found out I was an experiment by Kissinger, who was in the
                    process of shaking up the Foreign Service. One aspect was to assign so-called
                    promising young officers as ambassadors of small embassies. I became the
                    then-youngest FSO ambassador in Foreign Service history - briefly.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: That's right. My record lasted about a year until he or someone else
                    younger was named. In my case, the New York Times had an article saying that
                    Secretary Kissinger thought the Foreign Service too specialized regionally and
                    that he would transfer a large number of FSOs to so-called “out of area” posts
                    by the summer. Make them all more “global” and thus broaden expertise.</p>
                <p>Further down in the article it said that the first example of his “unconventional
                    approach” of younger more junior ambassadors was naming me to Rwanda. It also
                    quoted some anonymous senior “fiftyish” FSO who said, “Who ever heard of a class
                    three officer being picked as ambassador?”. So that's how I went to Rwanda at
                    age 39.</p>
                <p>Q: So did the Kissinger initiative on younger ambassadors last?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: No. The power structure of senior officers was opposed, in part, because
                    it reduced the number of ambassadorships for them. Being the first appointed and
                    thus the first assigned back to the Department, I adopted a low profile on
                    return. As an East Asian (EA) Bureau office director, I didn't use the
                    “ambassador” title, didn't put it on the door, and didn't use it in memos. Just
                    downplayed it all. After all, none of the EA Deputy Assistant Secretaries or
                    Assistant Secretary Holbrooke had then been ambassadors. It was all in vain. The
                    “young” ambassador program was wiped out - for all the bureaucratic, envy and
                    system reasons you can assume.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>One could tell from the beginning that it wouldn't last. I was not sworn in on
                    the Eighth Floor, as was routine. Instead, I was sworn in on the Sixth Floor.
                    “They” wouldn't give me access to the swish rooms. It was the system striking
                    back. The only person I could get to swear me in was a deputy assistant chief of
                    protocol. The Department wouldn't pay for any of the snacks and beverages. It
                    was pretty much a third-class train. In reporting from Kigali, I was careful
                    about when to use the first-person pronoun. Everybody knew these cables were
                    from an unprecedented “junior” ambassador.</p>
                <p>Another indication of lack of status was that I never met Secretary Kissinger,
                    who had no real interest in Africa or in junior officers like me, despite his
                    initiative. Indeed, two of my best-kept secrets during my tenure in Rwanda were
                    that I only met President Nixon once (in a Japan Desk context) and I never met
                    the then-Secretary of State. When I was in Washington on consultations, of
                    course, the Rwandans thought I was doing wonderful things at the “highest
                    levels.” Well, I wasn't. For me, the decision-makers and resource-givers were at
                    the deputy assistant secretary and office director levels.</p>
                <p>Q: Again, this is not exactly a place that you'd spent a lot of time brooding or
                    contemplating about - Rwanda. Did you know anything about it before?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Not at all, but I began reading, although materials were limited. But I
                    will comment, Stu, on your implication. Sure, Rwanda was small, but my mind sort
                    of comparable to a Navy destroyer. A small command far away. Terrific!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you go out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: In March 1974, exactly a year after arriving in Khartoum..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't remember which of those twin countries is at the
                        bottoand which is at on top?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Burundi is at the bottom, Rwanda is on top.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. What were you getting about American interests,
                        mean, when you went to the Desk and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>FRITTS: Our overall mission was to support a moderate government in a Francophone
                    African country. Our interests were the standard ones for Africa at that time.
                    The U.S. had - and still has - an embassy in virtually every African country of
                    whatever size and importance. We are the only country to have such a presence.
                    The “universality” policy was initiated in the Kennedy Administration as UK
                    Prime Minister's MacMillan's “winds of change” blew independence into some forty
                    new countries. We pursued favorable votes in the UN, the protection and welfare
                    of American citizens, human rights and plural governance, American private
                    investment, and ecological conservation. Politically, we were a window on Idi
                    Amin's Uganda, a peephole on Zaire, and a wary observer of Libya. Within the
                    Cold War, we were a mutually competitive local nuisance for the PRC, the
                    Soviets, the North Koreans - all of whom had embassies - and, occasionally, the
                    Cubans who were activists in Africa. The Cold War was the rationale for much of
                    our diplomatic activity throughout Africa. We ran a small AID program and began
                    a Peace Corps program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So when you out there, what was the country like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Rwanda is the size of Maryland, but with a then-population of about five
                    million. It was one of the most densely populated countries in the world and
                    also one of the poorest. The country had been colonized late by the Germans -
                    only in the 1880s.</p>
                <p>Like its southern Burundi neighbor, the population was composed of Tutsis in the
                    minority and Hutus in the majority. Historically, the Tutsis had been dominant,
                    but shortly before independence had been overthrown and slaughtered by the Hutus
                    who subsequently controlled its post-independence governments. There were
                    occasional tensions and murders, but the government pursued a policy of national
                    reconciliation and a number of Tutsis had top jobs. Both groups shared the same
                    culture and language with much intermarriage. Still, everyone knew who was what,
                    even though it wasn't physically apparent. There was the stereotype of the tall
                    thin Tutsis and short squat Hutus, but most, as one French journalist noted,
                    were “people of medium height.”</p>
                <p>The major foreign power, in practice, was Belgium as Rwanda became Belgian colony
                    under a League of Nations and subsequent UN mandates following WWI and WWII. One
                    of the unusual and welcome aspects for me was to become a small power. When
                    Rwandan Government officials asked me for this or that, I could say, “Well,
                    that's not really in my line, go see the big power. Ask the Belgians.” I was
                    thus absolved from some of the issues that normally come America's way - such as
                    military assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any American community?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>FRITTS: Yes, about 200 spread around the countrmissionaries, business and
                    holdovers from the colonial period who had made a life in Africa. Several were
                    remarkable.</p>
                <p>One was Joe Wertheim, a tea entrepreneur and expert, who created a tea plantation
                    and, subsequently, a tea factory as well. He was the first American direct
                    investor in Rwanda and received the first USG overseas investment insurance
                    guarantee for a project in Rwanda. His operation still runs almost thirty years
                    later after a continual series of crises, including Rwandan bad faith.
                    government corruption, fires, theft and genocide. The tale of his smarts,
                    persistence and integrity should be a novel.</p>
                <p>Another was Rosamond Carr, now in her eighties, who has lived virtually her
                    entire adult life in Africa and Rwanda and is the closest to a living saint most
                    people will ever know. Living up-country in genteel poverty, her love of the
                    people, Tutsi and Hutu, has been her only protection through recurrent
                    revolution, destruction and bloodletting. She now runs an orphanage for nearly a
                    hundred kids whose parents have been murdered in ethnic strife. She was played
                    by Julie Harris in the film “Gorillas in the Mist” on the life of Diane Fossey.
                    (Rosamond Carr's story is in her autobiography “Land of A Thousand Hills” 1999).
                    Diane was played by American actresSigourney Weaver, who is now a major donor to
                    Rosamond's orphanage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you know Fossey well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Yes, quite well. Diane was one of the woman primate behavioralists whom
                    the naturalist Louis Leakey chose personally. The other two were Jane Goodall,
                    who focused on chimpanzees in Tanzania and a third, whose name I forget, covered
                    orangutans in Borneo. Diane's life and focus were on Rwanda's remnant population
                    of endangered mountain gorillas.</p>
                <p>She and a British or American student assistant or two, lived amidst gorilla
                    habitat in a small camp, the Karisoke Research Center, at 10,000 feet on the
                    slope of Mount Visoke, an extinct volcano. We could theoretically reach her by
                    embassy radio, but she seldom had it on and it was unreliable. Communication was
                    often by happenstance courier which wasn't easy. Although only ninety miles
                    away, it was a four-hour trip by vehicle and then a two-hour climb up the trail
                    on the volcano.</p>
                <p>She was unique - a legend in her own time and obsessive over the gorillas, which
                    she protected fiercely. The mountain and gorillas were “hers.” I spent a good
                    deal of time trying to facilitate her work, in part by keeping her from being
                    expelled. She would, for example, chasten poachers by kidnaping their children.
                    The kids, by the way, loved ithree meals a day, small animals to play with, soft
                    camp beds etc. They'd sometimes refuse to return to their parents.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>Other incidents were more serious, such as leading retaliation raids against
                    poachers to capture their possessions and equipment or driving off cattle, which
                    impinged illegally and were destructive of gorilla habitat. The cattle were an
                    important issue as they and their horns are the basis of Rwandan culture,
                    prestige and male status. She also had her Rwandan assistants, who were known as
                    trackers and devoted to her, alarm the gorillas, if the trackers were sighted by
                    them. Her rationale was that as all the poachers were African, she wanted the
                    gorillas to associate that Africans were dangerous and whites observers were
                    not. It was not politically correct, of course, but her means to an end.</p>
                <p>One time she was about to be kicked out, but I wangled a temporary stay and sent
                    word to her that I had arranged an informal “last resort court” at a regular
                    weekly informal get-together of President Habyarimana and his cabinet held at a
                    guest house in Kigali. I sent a note and vehicle to alert her a couple of days
                    ahead, not knowing if she would respond. She arrived in our vehicle at the last
                    moment unkempt in her usual bush outfit. We gave her our guest room and an hour
                    later she came out clothed in an attractive long white dress with golden belt,
                    earrings and her hair arranged, etc. She looked gangbusters. We went over and
                    she gave a presentation in fractured French and Swahili with a faded National
                    Geographic documentary on the gorillas, using our embassy projector. The viewers
                    were fascinated. I don't think any of them had seen a gorilla before. She was
                    not only not expelled, but the government made additional concessions to protect
                    the gorillas. A book, “Gorillas In The Mist” was published in 1983 and later
                    became the movie. That story was not included.</p>
                <p>Despite her brittle exterior, Diane had a soft spot for children. Audrey, our
                    daughters and I were at Karisoke for several days once and she took the kids out
                    to track a gorilla group while her assistant, Kelly Stewart, daughter of the
                    actor, James Stewart, took my wife and me. We were antsy about that, but Diane
                    was adamant, saying that human parents were primates and any misperceived
                    protective reactions to close encounters could be dangerous. It worked out fine,
                    of course. We learned from the kids thaDiane, at one point, sat on a log with
                    the girls while Digit, her favorite gorilla, came up behind and touched, stroked
                    and smelled the girls' long hair. Diane told them gorillas have color vision and
                    it was the first time Digit had seen blond hair. Quite an experience.</p>
                <p>She and I had a policy disagreement as I (and her supporters such as the National
                    Geographic Society and the African Wildlife Foundation) supported projects
                    designed to prove to the villagers and poachers that tourism could make gorillas
                    more valuable alive than dead and thus lessen poaching and infringement. Diane
                    wanted none of it, but eventually came around.</p>
                <p>Well after my time, she was murdered at her camp. The Rwandan Government said it
                    was by a jealous British assistant. Almost everyone else, including me, believes
                    it was by a poacher Diane had punished by taking his amulet - a very personal
                    and magical item for Rwandans. She was an amazing American who did wonderful
                    work in her very own way. She's buried at Karisoke.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many people in the embassy? What was the staff
                        like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: It was quite small, of course. The chancery was a converted butcher shop.
                    There was still a meat hook attached to a ceiling, but the building was
                    functional. We had seven or eight Americans, half a dozen third-country
                    nationals, and maybe twenty-five Rwandans and African FSNs. Ethnically, we had
                    difficulties at times in our African work force, not only because of the
                    Hutu-Tutsi issue, but also because of a mix of Zairois and Ugandans as well as
                    Rwandans. The Motor Pool “downed tools” once for a day because a Zairois
                    mechanic from a tribe with a history of cannibalism threatened to eat his
                    Rwandan supervisor.</p>
                <p>We also had a more serious strike when the DCM, Peter Higgins, uncovered the fact
                    that the embassy apparently had never given out any performance awards to our
                    African employees. Naturally, I was aghast and we rectified what we thought was
                    the oversight at our next general awards ceremony. Following the awards, I was
                    pleased to see several of our younger - and better - employees returning from
                    lunch downtown wearing new shirts and showing off their shoes.</p>
                <p>But the next morning was a different story. My periodic walk through the general
                    services area of motorpool and crafts was met, not with jovial talk, but
                    sullenness and turned backs. Later in the morning, a strike was announced. What
                    had happened? Peter got some insights, but a leadership group wanted to meet
                    with me personally.</p>
                <p>When we met, the group emphasized in great detail that I, as the ambassador and
                    hence “Father of the embassy family” had violated Rwandan chief and family
                    customs by not treating “all of my children equally” and, particularly, by not
                    ensuring that the older got stuff before the younger. The leadership group, of
                    course, were all older.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Temporized. I listened, asked questions, used elliptical French, and said
                    I would need to commune with Washington etc. which, of course, I never did. The
                    group decided to go back to work, but sullenly, while we pondered what to do.
                    Fortunately, Peter later “discovered” that every one of the leadership group had
                    been overlooked in previous years for length-of-service salary step increases or
                    similar causes for financial esteem. At our next awards ceremony several months
                    later, we made everybody whole. I never asked Peter any probing questions about
                    his “discoveries.” I also learned the helpful lesson that what we Americans may
                    think as enlightened management practices are not universal nor are our
                    definitions of discrimination.</p>

                <p>FRITTS: No, not really, other than keeping Diane Fossey in-country.There was some
                    petty crime, but American tourism was small.</p>
                <p>As for the embassy homes, our guard force was so unskilled and illiterate that we
                    couldn't trust them with any weapons or equipment. The administrative officer
                    wryly wrote and published a local Request-to-Bid for spears, bows and arrows. Lo
                    and behold, one morning in the motor pool there were about six purveyors
                    demonstrating the manufacture of their wares and test firing them. Some of the
                    arrows wove back and forth 30 degrees from the horizontal. A bidder won the
                    contract and our house guards thence went armed, in a sense. I saw some irony in
                    asking the government to vote on UN nuclear Armageddon issues, while negotiating
                    locally for superiority in pre-industrial weaponry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was life like in Rwanda? Were you able to educate
                        your kids?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Yes, the usual Foreign Service approach of making the best of what
                    exists. The only school was a Belgian school and our daughters, Susan and Robin,
                    at first knew only a few words in French. Near the end of our tour they won
                    prizes for the best pupils in the school, for which we applaud them to this day.
                    They were young tykes, nine and twelve, whatever it was. They came home one day
                    and said, “We're teased because we're Americans and don't speak French very
                    well, we can't ask questions in class, we don't have many friends, there are no
                    extra-curricular activities, there's no dancing and no boy-girl stuff. So we're
                    just going to study and prove them all wrong.” And, of course, they wound up
                    with lots of friends and really enjoyed the school. Coping and excelling are not
                    bad things to learn overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, not at all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Rwanda was stable and travel, while inconvenient, was safe. Rwanda was
                    not very big and we traveled around a good bit by van, always with a 50 gal.
                    gasoline drum in the rearmost seat. The roads were awful - sixty to seventy
                    miles in three hours or so was a good pace.</p>
                <p>Rwandans are dignified with a somewhat isolated mountain mentality - very stoic.
                    They had been colonized late by the Germans, only in the 1880s. But they could
                    also be conspiratorial and untrusting, particularly within their culture which
                    set great store upon cloaking one's thoughts. And this impacted occasionally
                    upon us.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>I recall having a local issue which I thought could be resolved if I could get a
                    better handle on what the real problem might be. But my government sources were
                    evasive. I thus went to a retired older government official whom I had found a
                    useful sounding board. He listened to my tale, said he would help (and did), and
                    then explained a bit of intriguing Rwandan cultural behavior. He said that
                    children in the West are punished if they tell lies. In Rwanda, they were
                    punished if they tell the truth. A Rwandan, Tutsi or Hutu, one clan or another,
                    one neighbor or another, he explained, must always guard against unwittingly
                    giving information to a potential enemy. Thus, Westerners, being open, are
                    considered childlike. I, of course, continued to be professionally American in
                    how I did things, but I wonder how the international trials of those responsible
                    for the recent genocide in Rwanda can ever be completed successfully under
                    Western rules of evidence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were any other agencies or departments trying to put
                        people intRwanda or were you pretty well out of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: We were quite self-contained - pure State Department, no AID, USIA,
                    Commerce, and Defense Attach�, etc. People liked visiting us, but no agency
                    wanted to be there. It was wonderful. Our agency support came mainly from
                    Nairobi, particularly USAID, which had a large regional office there. I thus
                    flew to Nairobi three or four times a year on consultation and the family as
                    well, where we could go to real restaurants. We also weren't on Congressional
                    itineraries. We were pretty much left alone to do our thing the way we wanted to
                    do it. That was fine by me.</p>
                <p>Speaking of the Congress reminds me that at one point the country was in severe
                    drought and we arranged for emergency shipments of PL-480 sorghum grain, which
                    was the principal Rwandan food commodity. Logistically, it was difficult, but we
                    were the first country to respond, the Rwandan government let us bypass its own
                    system, so we could distribute directly and fairly through Rwandan church and
                    foreign missionary groups. The embassy staff and I monitored many distributions
                    and it was very gratifying. We saved hundreds if not thousands of lives.</p>
                <p>We knew that sorghum beer was also the Rwandan beverage of choice and began to
                    hear that the Rwandans had discovered American sorghum grain produced beer of a
                    remarkably high alcohol content compared to the locally grown. Thus, a
                    considerable portion of our sorghum was going into beer production. Including
                    for babies! Rwandans routinely gave babies sorghum beer that, I learned, has a
                    very high protein content. We tried to prevent diversion, but not very
                    effectively, and, and after all, the beer was being produced by individuals in
                    small quantities and consumed on site. Nevertheless, I learned that we might
                    have a CODEL to observe our emergency food aid. I could visualize the headlines
                    in the U.S. to the effect that I was using taxpayer's dollars to produce infant
                    alcoholics! No CODEL came, thankfully.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>I also used AID funding to support conservation, such as saving a residual herd
                    of elephants by sedating and transporting the younger ones to a newly protected
                    isthmus in Rwanda's Kagera National Park. Unfortunately, the older ones had to
                    be killed as they could not be moved. As it was, an American wildlife
                    photographer, Lee Lyon, was killed by one of the elephants on its release. She
                    had a premonition of death and, to meet her reported wishes, I expended some
                    hoarded good will with the foreign minister and she was buried by the park.
                    Again, as most Americans don't know, every embassy has caskets that come in
                    handy. The consular officer, David Rawson who later became ambassador there,
                    helped prepare the body. I sometimes felt sorry for colleagues in Europe -
                    glitzy, sure, but exotic? Or challenging? Each day in Africa was different.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Tutsi-Hutu problem very prominent then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: I'm often asked these days whether I foresaw or whether the USG should
                    have foreseen the recent Hutu massacre of Tutsis. During my time, we were well
                    aware of tensions and the prioHutu slaughter of Tutsis which, as I mentioned,
                    had occurred in 1962. We knew that occasionally huts were burned and cattle
                    stolen, that scores were settled and reopened, and we even had occasional ethnic
                    problems within the FSN staff, which affected our hiring decisions. But the
                    problems were local and not national.</p>
                <p>In that regard, I found the president, Juvenal Habyarimana, a former Army
                    Chief-of-Staff and Hutu, a very decent man. He was a practicing Roman Catholic
                    of imposing physical stature. He had come to power two years previously after
                    returning from the embassy's July 4th reception to find assassins waiting for
                    him. He was very much imbued with trying to overcome the Hutu-Tutsi past and
                    integrate things together. There were Tutsi ministers in the government and a
                    lot of slogans to the effect “We're all Rwandans”, downplaying clan and other
                    ethnic loyalties. Indeed, I noted in my farewell-from-post analysis that if
                    Habyarimana could stay in office for several years on the path he was on, he
                    could become a credible mediator of African conflicts. It was thus a surprise to
                    me two decades later to learn of the mass ethnic polarization and his alleged
                    role. However, there is some evidence that he and his plane were blown up as a
                    pretext for the genocide, at least, in part, because he had signed a
                    power-sharing agreement with the former Tutsi refugee army that had invaded from
                    Uganda several years before and is now the government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about American missionaries?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>FRITTS: There were American and other missionary groups hither and thither. We
                    visited them frequently and their mission stations were often the only available
                    stopovers with food, beds and fuel (which we prestaged or replaced). They had
                    useful insights into their communities as to what the problems were and helped
                    to guide some of our aid decisions. They loved the opportunity of talking with
                    people with outside news, beyond the BBC, VOA or Deutsche Welle.</p>
                <p>I had great respect for the missionaries and their commitment and devotion. I was
                    also concerned by the expectation of many of them, who were second or third
                    generation, to have their children follow in their footsteps. I felt there was
                    no future for white foreign missionaries in Africa - and there wasn't.</p>
                <p>Rwanda was nominally Catholic and Rwandan bishops and priests had great influence
                    in the prefectures. It was useful to attend religious events, of which there
                    were many. For Protestants, Audrey and I became well versed in Catholic Masses,
                    the large ones were held outdoors with congregations on the hillsides. Very
                    colorful.</p>
                <p>Q: On the missionaries, it's one of the great problems. It's sort of a Christian
                    colonialism, in a way. The same trouble in Korea when I was there, too. I mean
                    third, fourth generation of missionaries.</p>
                <p>FRITTS: It's a way of life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much of a diplomatic community?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: To a degree. A handful of African states, plus the Belgians, Brits,
                    French, Chinese, Russians, the two Koreas, the Vatican and a few others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the Cold War intruded there, did it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Sure. We did the usual Cold War reporting and demarches. And tried to
                    break through the Soviet isolation. The Russian ambassador's residence was just
                    behind mine with only a wood and bamboo fence between us. Every Wednesday night
                    they would show an outdoor movie of the Great Patriotic War to their guests and
                    staff. So every Wednesday night we had tanks, bazookas and bombs going off. As
                    was normal then, we and the Soviets had little to do with each other - by their
                    preference. I invited the Soviet Ambassador one night to a movie, Nicholas and
                    Alexandra, and said in a hand-written note that it was favorable to the
                    Revolution, but, of course, he didn't come. We exchanged the traditional calls
                    and courtesies, but he didn't speak much French. He did opine to me once that he
                    didn't like “these African peoples” very much, but hoped to complete six years
                    in Rwanda to qualify for a Rwandan Government decoration.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the UN votes? How did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, as with all my colleagues in Africa, we were expected to “improve”
                    the UN voting patterns of our host country. Rwanda was better than some and
                    worse than others. It was sort of in the middle, bearing in mind that hardly any
                    country was over 40%, with the possible exception of Liberia. But we made our
                    demarches and presentations along with personal diplomacy. I remember telling
                    the Foreign Minister once that since the last UN General Assembly, I had done a,
                    b and c for him and Rwanda and now it was their turn to show something for me.
                    Rather than voting against us on some key vote, they abstained, which counted as
                    an “improvement” in Washington. With the Soviet Union now gone, one can look
                    upon all this much more dispassionately.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Zaire?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Zaire under Mobutu was quite stable, relatively speaking. The Rwandans
                    were wary of Zaire and its capacity for mischief toward its much smaller
                    neighbor, which had been a virtual appendage during the colonial period. One
                    positive initiative was the formation at this time of the Great Lakes
                    Convention, encompassing Zaire, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and, I think, Tanzania.
                    There was a lot of talk about economic integration, none of which had much
                    substance, but the psychology was good.</p>
                <p>I made several trips to the adjoining Kivu provinces in Zaire and was surprised
                    to find that people there spoke a variety of Kinyarwanda. The area was a vestige
                    of the pre-colonial Rwandan and Burundi Tutsi kingdoms.</p>
                <p>As its turned out, it that swath of territory, much larger than Rwanda itself,
                    which the current Rwandan Government occupies as part of its military
                    intervention into what is now again the Congo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Uganda?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Uganda was under Idi Amin. He complicated Rwanda's life and our life,
                    because he had a throttlehold hold on Rwanda's transport lifeline - the road
                    from Mombasa and Nairobi in Kenya to Kigali, about 800 miles or so. Truck
                    convoys to and from Rwanda were started and stopped by Ugandan policy whim and
                    corruption. Rwanda was thus often in short supply and/or its exports and foreign
                    exchange on hold. In the embassy, we would be thrown back on our own resources
                    for periods of time.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>A small anecdote about that was the delayed arrival of my new official car from
                    Mombasa due in Kigali by truck. Weeks went by as it became “lost” somewhere en
                    route. Finally, I heard it was in town, but Peter Higgins said it needed fixing
                    up in another location and to be patient. Each time I asked, he said it needed a
                    little more time. Two weeks or so went by. It was still being “fixed up”. So I
                    finally said, “Peter, what's the story?” He took me to a warehouse by an open
                    field outside of town. There was the brand-new official Chevrolet with its
                    interior completely gutted. All the seats out, carpets and pieces of upholstery
                    draped over bushes, side panels off. Everything. I asked, “What happened?”
                    “Well,” he said, “The car was on a truck from Mombasa to Kigali and the truck
                    driver decided to make a little extra money, so he used it as a chicken coop -
                    buying and selling chickens along the way.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My God! Tanzania, did that play any role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: No, there were no Rwandan bilateral issues and no Tanzanian embassy.
                    There was also virtually no trade with an also-impoverished Tanzania. It would
                    have been different if the proposed railroad from Dar Es Salaam to Kigali had
                    been built by the Germans, but WW I stopped it, literally, in its tracks.</p>
                <p>At the border, the bridge over the river was used in the 1960s, and more
                    recently, as a place to count massacred bodies going down river and provide some
                    numerical estimate of the numbers killed. I went across the bridge several
                    times, just to step foot into Tanzania.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: David Mark, I think. David and I had some common issues as his government
                    was Tutsi, rather than Hutu controlled, and each government was suspicious of
                    the other, although both professed “renewed” friendship. He and I thus visited
                    back and forth a bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said there were two Peace Corps Volunteers. What were
                        thedoing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: We had just begun the program and their arrival was experimental for the
                    government and for us. They were involved with education at the University of
                    Rwanda in Butare, which is an easier starting point than community development.
                    After I left, the program became reasonably large.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In retrospect, was Rwanda worth it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>FRITTS: Sure. We did everything a large embassy did, but on a smaller scale. I
                    was in up to my ears. I was working nights with all the sorts of things one does
                    in the Foreign Service when you think you have a mandate, are trying to do good,
                    and represent the U.S. in a foreign land. Did we have any crises? Yes, but none
                    that concerned the Seventh Floor, the Congress, or the American media of the
                    time. We had to be self-reliant.</p>
                <p>It was special. We had the gratification and chagrin of seeing quite quickly when
                    we did well or poorly. Small embassies are microcosms. They were challenging
                    training grounds. And especially valuable for younger officers.</p>
                <p>Professionally, it also worked out well. I had a good corridor reputation and
                    tried to build on and trade whatever goodwill I had accumulated in only fourteen
                    years in the Service. When I did bark, I was sustained. I had no more than the
                    usual complaints about the “home office”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you came back to the Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Yes, Audrey and I believed strongly in our daughters going to an American
                    public high school in order to be truly American. We came back, bought a house
                    in a fine school district, and got the children into school. We would be in the
                    U.S. for seven years, a relatively long time in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Seven years from about when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Oh, 1976-1983.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you start doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: I spent the first year in the Senior Seminar at the Foreign Service
                    Institute (FSI) which, of course, provided great exposure to what was going on
                    in America. It also bridged (thankfully) the presidential transition from Ford
                    to Carter. With a reshuffling in the State Department. Dick Holbrooke became the
                    new Assistant Secretary for East Asian (EA) Affairs. He tapped me for one of his
                    office directors.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>Mine would be a new combination of Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Burma, and
                    Singapore, plus the political part of the regional Association for Southeast
                    Asian Nations (ASEAN). The acronym was TIMBS. It was the only EA
                    multi-functional multi-country directorate and included eleven posts. Dick had
                    added Thailand and Burma, because he wanted to send a signal to the Thai that
                    they had become too dependent upon American political access and economic
                    largesse. Thailand would now be treated as a “regular” country. It was sort of a
                    super-directorate of fascinating countries.</p>
                <p>Dick also offered me the choice of Japanese Affairs (EA/J), but I had previously
                    been directly involved with Japan, in Tokyo and the Department, for over six
                    years. Not much had changed. It seemed to me the burden of U.S.-Japan relations
                    was to handle the same issues over and over in different guises. I knew the
                    policies and the jargon too well. I wanted a new region and Dick gave it to me.
                    Actually, he was relieved as I later learned he wanted to give EA/J to Nick
                    Platt, but somehow felt he had to ask me first. Some thought I made a mistake
                    given the importance of Japan to the U.S. I don't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, in the first place, how did Dick Holbrooke
                        operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Holbrooke was an activist - brilliant, aggressive, innovative, creative
                    and disruptive. He had little patience for previous policy or prudent advice.
                    His approach was unsettling to the Foreign Service and also to foreign
                    diplomats. He was highly conceptual and visionary, could be absolutely charming
                    or totally insulting, the latter often unnecessarily. He could be courageously
                    supportive of some officers and ravishingly cruel towards others. He was a
                    consummate strategist and achiever.</p>
                <p>For me, he was exciting to work with, but also disconcerting. I'm organized and
                    structured. While admiring his talents, I didn't seek out his company and didn't
                    fawn on him.</p>
                <p>Holbrooke had an eye for talent and recruited a stable of outstanding deputy
                    assistant secretaries, particularly Bob Oakley, to whom I reported. Oakley was
                    also an activist and, while totally loyal to Dick, knew his faults and helped us
                    work around them. I never worked with anyone with as many ideas as Bob Oakley.
                    Added into the coterie werMike Armacost (NSC) and DASs Mort Abramowitz at
                    DOD/ISA and, later, John Negroponte, who succeeded Oakley. A lot of intellectual
                    firepower and all went on to bigger things - Armacost eventually as
                    Undersecretary for Political Affairs in the Bush Administration.</p>
                <p>The group would meet with Dick two or three times a week in the evening to kick
                    ideas around and coordinate policy. Other office directors and I would
                    occasionally attend. In retrospect, the sessions were seminars on how to create
                    and affect foreign policy, not with foreign states, but by outmaneuvering the
                    NSC, DOD or State bureaus and our own Principals on the Seventh Floor. I learned
                    a lot and also became considerably less in awe of high officialdom.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>An anecdote on dress. The Carter Administration took symbolic pride in its
                    populist origin “the man from Plains, Georgia,” etc. Coats and ties were
                    considered very much ancien regime. Dick and the other appointed luminaries
                    affected jeans, scuffed boots, and open-necked shirts. The dress miffed and
                    insulted ambassadors and visiting officials. They found it rude and immature. I
                    recall Dick talking to the Indonesian ambassador with his boots up on a table
                    with the soles pointed at the ambassador, a gross insult within Indonesian
                    culture. Dick learned and toned down over time. I was amused when he later
                    joined a major New York investment bank and I'd see photos of him in three-piece
                    suits and watch fob.</p>
                <p>As I said, Dick was not alone. High-appointed State officials rubbed new cowboy
                    boots to look old, abhorred closets full of suits and so forth. Even on the
                    Seventh Floor. The images were costly while they lasted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Carter Administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Much the same as I found Holbrooke. I think the Foreign Service found the
                    Carter Administration creative and disconcerting. The assumption was that
                    whatever policy we had been doing had to be wrong. That we were not trusted. We
                    were not “their” people. We had only given lip service to human rights, had
                    coddled up to dictators, and pursued policies tinged with immorality. MosForeign
                    Service officers found that hard to swallow. In retrospect, of course, such
                    “outside” attitudes always existed, but I think they became axiomatic after
                    Carter. Reagan also ran a populist mantra against “the Beltway.”</p>
                <p>Now it's normal and has much to do, in my opinion, with the loss of prestige and
                    trust in public service and our difficulties in Foreign Service recruitment.
                    Also a great waste of time and resources as every administration reinvents
                    wheels.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, within a short period of time, many Foreign Service officers,
                    particularly those of us working for Dick, found ourselves freed from
                    inhibitions and structures that had been static and stultifying. If you had an
                    idea, you could get a hearing. Indeed, pressures for new ideas were intense.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's begin with the big picture. You'll recall the fall of Vietnam in the
                    spring of '75. It had been an article of faith for a long time, at least for
                    those who supported our role in South Vietnam, that the other countries around
                    would act like a row of dominos and start to fall. Now you were dealing with the
                    potential dominos a rather short time after the fall. Was there concern about
                    Vietnam, an aggressive Communist Vietnam, or had that kind of dissipated?</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>FRITTS: There had been great concern, but Dick less so and he believed it was
                    time to reorient our policy in Asia to a post-Viet Nam mode. Policy-wise, we
                    would, of course, emphasize and deal in providing regional reassurance of a U.S.
                    security, policy and economic presence and, when necessary, buttress. Dick also
                    believed the dominoes didn't and wouldn't fall if we properly valued the he
                    forces of nationalism as well as the fiber of leaders in the Association of
                    Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), although the Thai were beset. The Viet
                    Nam-stimulated exodus of refugees was also regarded, correctly, as a politically
                    hostile and intentionally destabilizing campaign directed at the region. The
                    Vietnamese thus helped our political stance. We devoted a lot of resources and
                    diplomatic capital to demonstrate that the U.S. was an Asian power in for the
                    long haul and we could be counted on. The effort was successful. The policy was
                    often beset in trying to harmonize it with political concerns over human rights,
                    including East Timor in Indonesia. As well as the Golden Triangle of narcotics
                    production and trafficking in Burma and Thailand.</p>
                <p>Q: Another argument is that both the investment that we put there, but also the
                    time allowed during the 10 years we were involved in South Vietnam, gave the
                    countries time to develop a backbone and a stiffening, economic and
                    political.</p>
                <p>FRITTS: That's also true.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, going back to the domino theory, were you conscious of our trying to
                    build up Thailand and these countries around to resist a possible resurgence of
                    Vietnamese aggression?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Sure. With ASEAN, we began to try and institutionalize processes of joint
                    consultations and programs that would lead to habits of political cooperation
                    and cohesion which, in turn, would assist our strategic, military, economic and
                    political goals in the region. Remember, the Cold War was still on. There was a
                    strategic position and political web in Asia we sought to maintain.</p>
                <p>Q: Some persons have the feeling that, in a way, what we call Indochina now,
                    except for the refugees, had dropped off the map of our interests, and that
                    since we'd lost that one, we ought to get on with something else?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Do you mean after the fall of Saigon?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>FRITTS: Not from my perspective. Vietnamese refugees were a major issue. There
                    was concern over regional stability and shoring up ASEAN. The POW-MIA aspect was
                    big. Then we had the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia to overthrow Pol Pot with a
                    perceived threat to Thailand. Thailand thus became big on our scope politically
                    and it was also a major focus of American investment. Many Americans had served
                    in Thailand as an ally in Viet-Nam war. Thailand thus regained a very high
                    visibility in Washington. In addition, all the ASEAN states were nervous over
                    the depth of U.S. strategic-military posture and commitment in the wake of Viet
                    Nam.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there concern on the part, particularly, you say, of Indonesia or
                    Malaysia, at all, that the United States was really withdrawing from the
                    region?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Certainly. And those concerns were our concern. To a degree, the ASEAN
                    countries probably heightened it in order to extract more from us. Lee Kwan Yu,
                    however, was particularly concerned about a U.S. precipitate naval withdrawal.
                    He offered to provide repair facilities in Singapore. We turned it down then,
                    but accepted it some years later when the Philippines shut down our bases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we a catalyst toward the ASEAN association or were we
                        sorof an outsider looking in, at this particular time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: We were both. Our public stance was that the ASEAN states were very
                    competent and could manage their own interests in the region without big brother
                    beating on them. We thus stressed their formal structure and our only informal
                    consultation. In practice, not much was done unless we worked behind the scenes
                    to encourage, goad and mediate. We thus maintained a public consultative facade
                    while providing political substance behind the scenes. That dual role was
                    welcome within ASEAN, particularly when one ASEAN state or another had to be
                    out-maneuvered by the others, who didn't want to adopt a position officially or
                    formally. Sometimes they copped out wit“Let the U.S. do it and take the heat.”
                    We also overstepped ourselves occasionally and, fairly or unfairly, got smacked
                    down, usually by Mahathir in Malaysia, but also occasionally by Lee Kuan Yew in
                    Singapore. The Thai and Indonesians were more subtle.</p>
                <p>A major policy was to ease ASEAN into a political as well as economic forum as a
                    regional counter to what we also perceived as a potentially aggressive Indochina
                    group dominated by Viet Nam. The ASEANs shared our view, but didn't want to draw
                    attention from Viet Nam by any political “ganging up.” Accordingly, we and other
                    Western powers plus Japan, were careful. We consulted with ASEAN as a group only
                    on the periphery and after the ASEAN sessions were formally over.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>We also sought to inducASEAN to move into political substance rather than be
                    concerned only with economic issues. That was difficult because of interlocking
                    bilateral tensions, including intra-ASEAN attitudes toward Viet Nam, and hidden
                    pretensions of regional leadership by the players. The Indonesians felt they
                    were entitled to a leading role by size and destiny, the Filipinos because of
                    their historic background, size and U.S. relationship, the Singaporeans felt
                    they're so smart they ought to be on top, and the Malaysians weren't about to
                    cede a leadership role to anyone, especially Singapore or Indonesia. The Thais
                    sort of floated above it all, beset with a series of non-violent military coups
                    d'etat. The common wisdom was that ASEAN could and would do nothing
                    politically.</p>
                <p>But we kept pushing discreetly as topics of opportunity came into view. We
                    introduced political aspects gradually - sort of “down the garden path.” A
                    breakthrough occurred when we got “regional security” accepted as a legitimate
                    agenda item for the annual ASEAN summits. We also initiated the first U.S.-ASEAN
                    Dialogue at the Foreign Minister level as a side meeting of the ASEAN sessions.
                    That was a break-through.</p>
                <p>Human rights and corruption were always issues as were viable economic
                    development, including foreign and American private investment. And the
                    Vietnamese boat refugees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The boat people were a major problem, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Absolutely. Boat refugees were the major crisis of the period throughout
                    the region, including Australia, Hong Kong and Japan. We were engaged virtually
                    daily. Our goal was to maintain receptivity to first asylum - the ability for
                    refugees to stay in the country where they landed without being deterred at sea,
                    pushed off or expelled or treated inhumanely once landed. Our major carrot was
                    to provide “guarantees” that the receiving countries would not be stuck
                    eventually with residual refugee populations, of which many were ethnic Chinese,
                    always a volatile concern. We and other non-ASEAN countries relocated tens of
                    thousands of refugees. There were constant crises and constant struggles,
                    internationally and internally.</p>
                <p>Then Fidel Castro expelled thousands of Cubans from Mariel and the refugee shoe
                    was put on our foot. The U.S. became a receiving country of first asylum. The
                    ASEANs correctly pointed out that our moralistic stance of humanitarian
                    obligation somehow changed when the U.S. became a refugee target. President
                    Carter said initially “Y'all come” and then reversed himself when Florida and
                    other refugee states exploded politically. We began to intercept refugees at sea
                    in the Caribbean, which ASEAN leaders found analogous to their recurrent
                    off-shore deterrence practices. In theory, they had a point. In practice, not.
                    Americans with tacit official support were not robbing, killing, raping and
                    enslaving refugees at sea as Malaysians and Thai were. We were accused of a
                    double standard.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How well did you find the East Asian Bureau worked with
                        thBureau of Refugees?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: We worked well together, with a lot of mutual respect. A number of
                    Foreign Service officers with Viet Nam experience were there. They were very
                    committed. We were agreed on the policy goal of maintaining first asylum. We
                    wanted to save lives. We had some tactical differences about the most effectual
                    ways to achieve it. The refugee folk tended to want to pound doors and issue
                    decrees. We felt it important to handle matters in an overall context. We came
                    together in crises, such as massive push-offs of landed refugees, forceful
                    interceptions at sea and real or threatened forcible repatriations from the
                    camps.</p>
                <p>The Refugee Bureau was highly assertive and rightfully so. In fact, when I moved
                    up and over to consular affairs (CA), we had recurrent issues with the Refugees
                    Bureau. BuI brought some credibility from TIMBS which helped to contain and
                    resolve them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was also, for the first time, a Bureau of Human
                        Rights.How were your relations with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Virtual bureaucratic war. The Human Rights Bureau under Pat Darien was
                    almost impossible to work with. Not to put too fine a line on it, she and her
                    deputies assumed we were immoral and untruthful and that neither we nor our
                    ambassadors were carrying out instructions with sufficient zeal. The Human
                    Rights Bureau people prided themselves on their access to private voluntary
                    groups, which they chose to believe were more reliable than we or our embassies.
                    They also had privileged access to kindred spirits in the Congress. Any
                    classified cable on human rights which the Human Rights Bureau could exploit was
                    leaked to key Members and staff right away. It was all quite poisonous - both
                    ways. One of my colleagues once opined that in previous administrations, Pat and
                    her deputies would have had their security clearances pulled. Or maybe be in
                    jail.</p>
                <p>An irony was that our then-major adversaries and mass violators of human rights
                    were just about untouchable e.g. the People's Republic of China, Viet Nam, the
                    USSR and the Eastern European countries. The U.S. had little leverage. Those
                    governments didn't care about our views on human rights and the NSC was careful
                    to calibrate those relationships. So Pat focused on the friendlies, such as in
                    ASEAN (and other regions). For those of trying to maintain a balanced approach,
                    it was frustrating and we attracted personal invective as well as professional
                    tensions.</p>
                <p>Even so, the Carter Administration's legacy of a stronger foreign policy emphasis
                    on human rights is admirable, even though it had historically been part of the
                    American moralist approach to foreign policy. And it became further
                    internalized. When speaking to public groups on foreign policy, I find they're
                    usually surprised that I saw little difference in the scope and tone of my
                    instructions on human rights issues, whether under Carter or Reagan.</p>

                <p>Q: Why don't we now cover the countries of TIMBS, starting with the smaller ones.
                    What was the situation in Burma and what were our concerns?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Our relationship with then-Burma, now Myanmar, had two policy prongs:
                    anti-narcotics and human rights, often in conflict. The salient and recurrent
                    focal point was the helos provided by the U.S. to the Burmese Army. Initially
                    unarmed, the Burmese put guns on them as, after all, they often got shot at on
                    anti-narcotic ops. But were the helos being used solely for anti-narcotics
                    operations, such as crop destruction? Or were they also being used to suppress
                    the many and varied insurgencies. In virtually every case, of course, insurgents
                    were also into narcotics in varying degrees. It was a fascinating m�lange -
                    tribal groups such as the Karens, autonomous warlords such as Khee Shan, and
                    even a remnant of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang army. We knew that parts of the
                    Burmese military and government were also in cahoots with selected producers and
                    traffickers among the insurgents. Some of the army's attacks on heroin
                    laboratories were staged, for example. There were continual shadow plays. It was
                    the Wild West of the Far East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the narcotics side, did you find the government
                        responsive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Only to a degree that the Burmese Government found our focus and aid useful in an
                    anti- insurgency context. For us, at best, political and, at worst, military.
                    Burma was also then and is today insular and isolated. Our embassy was
                    restricted and didn't have much access to officialdom. Nor did any Western
                    embassy. Our ambassador had never met Gen. Ne Win, who lived in seclusion. We
                    had intelligence on the Golden Triangle, the narcotics area enveloping the
                    borders of Burma, Thailand and Laos, but it was as unreliable as it was
                    complex.</p>
                <p>One way to keep in touch and induce the Burmese Government to respond was to
                    organize narcotics inspection visits. Mathea Falco, head of our anti-narcotics
                    bureau, developed quite good contacts with the Burmese. Too good, the human
                    rights folk said.</p>
                <p>A major player on Burma was Congressman Lester Wolf, Chairman of the House and
                    Senate Joint Committee on Narcotics. He led several CODELs to Burma. The helos
                    staged out of up-country sites and flew us into the narcotics and insurgency
                    areas. It was a great experience. We were able to talk with otherwise
                    inaccessible Burmese civilian and army types, often at senior levels.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>One policy issue we fought was Lester Wolfe's idea of a “preemptive buy.” It
                    actually originated with Knee Shan, a major drug lord, and picked up by Wolfe's
                    staffers. The idea was for the U.S. to buy the Golden Triangle's heroin
                    production in advance and thus keep it off the market. Deceptively simple. It
                    took us some time to convince Wolfe that heroin poppies should not be handled as
                    a subsidized American farm crop, whose main historical result had been to
                    increase production geometrically. Also no one had or would ever have a clue as
                    to actual total production. So we'd still have an illegal crop.</p>
                <p>Khee Sahn became angry after Wolfe decided not to pursue a “preemptive buy”
                    policy. On his next trip, the embassy learned that Knee Shan might attempt to
                    shoot down the helo carrying the Congressional Delegation (CODEL) helo. We thus
                    flew above 5000 feet. Wolfe told me to keep quiet and didn't tell his
                    Congressional colleagues (Congressmen Hyde and Dornan) until after the flight
                    was over. They were quite miffed with him. Years later I heard Dornan as host of
                    a call-in radio show talk of his courage in flying “alone” over Burma as the
                    assassination target of a drug lord. What a self- promoter...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was ambassador to Burma when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Maurice Bean for part of the time. After he left until now, we've had
                    only charge's d'affaires in Rangoon or Yangon, as it's now called.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much we could do in the human rights line?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: The usual demarches at working levels. And the recurrinissue of whether
                    the helicopters were being misused.</p>
                <p>There wasn't much leverage. We had only a very small aid program outside
                    narcotics. And narcotics control was the key priority for us. Japan was the
                    major donor with projects linked to former WW II reparations. The Japanese had
                    little interest in tweaking a major trade program for human rights goals.
                    Indeed, human rights in Burma became increasingly worse over the years. Make
                    that decades.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Thailand, the other new addition to your
                        directorate?.I'm surprised that they lumped Thailand with Burma..</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, Dick used the structural change to illustrate policy shift. And
                    narcotics issues were common problems along a common border with many of the
                    same players. More specifically, as I noted, Dick believed that during the Viet
                    Nam war Thailand had come to expect too special a relationship with the U.S. He
                    wanted Thailand, then a separate directorate with Burma, to revert to being a
                    “regular” country with a “normal” U.S. relationship. He thus folded it into
                    TIMBS, making us almost an Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN)
                    directorate. He considered adding the Philippines as well, but felt he couldn't
                    do so politically or bureaucratically because of the importance and visibility
                    of the U.S. bases. So, I got four fifths of ASEAN plus Burma. However, we did a
                    lot of the ASEAN political policy and support work.</p>
                <p>The new combo lasted a little over two years until the Vietnamese invasion of
                    Cambodia to overthrow Pol Pot. Thailand was perceived as under threat, which the
                    Thais also made as dramatic as possible. We and DOD began to scrounge tanks and
                    other military assistance from National Guard units. The workload on Thailand
                    soared. Mort Abramowitz, then ambassador to Thailand and a good friend of
                    Dick's, wanted more focused attention and back-stopping than we could provide
                    handling five countries. So Holbrooke called me at half time of a Super Bowl
                    game - called Paul Cleveland and me - and we went immediately to the Department
                    on that Sunday afternoon and split the office, broke up the files, etc. The
                    Thailand-Burma directorate was open for business on Monday morning. TIMBS became
                    IMS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the smallest of them alSingapore. How did we view
                        hiLee Kwan Yu by this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, Lee Kwan Yu and Henry Kissinger recognized each other as
                    intellectual peers. There was not now quite the same regard by Brzezinski or
                    Vance for Lee Kwan Yu nor he towards them. But he still liked to tell us what to
                    do and not to do.</p>
                <p>We also had bilateral issues with Singapore, because of their restrictive
                    treatment of Americans and other foreign tourists, ranging from spitting and
                    haircuts to mandatory death sentences for drugs.</p>
                <p>And there were recurring ethnic, investment and trade tensions between Singapore
                    and Malaysia plus Singapore and Indonesia which we tried to dampen.</p>
                <p>Singapore was very fortunate in having an exceptionally capable ambassador in
                    Washington, Punch Coomaraswamy. Punch, an ethnic Indian, had been the former
                    Chief Justice of the Singapore Supreme Court. He was a smart as any Singaporean,
                    while exceptionally personable, low-key, erudite and humorous. He knew everybody
                    at all useful official levels and defused a lot of American angst.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Malaysia? What were our concerns with

                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>FRITTS: Malaysia was always difficult. Indeed, dealings with Kuala Lumpur were
                    the most difficult and feisty of any so-called friendly government in my career.
                    Anything and everything were challenged in some way. They were closer
                    politically to Viet Nam than their ASEAN partners and thus their statements
                    often contained zingers toward the U.S. Prime Minister Mahathir reacted
                    particularly strongly to anything he deemed as pressure, such as on human
                    rights. They would ratchet up pressure over refugees whenever it suited their
                    purpose and force us and other Western states to accelerate our off take.
                    Elsewhere in the region, a bit of cajolery can go a long way. Not in Malaysia.
                    Everything required going through hoops.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk about Indonesia. What was going on?
                        You'served there some years before and now were back..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: I would have thought that Suharto would have given way to somebody else
                    in the interim, but it hadn't happened, would not happen on my watch, and,
                    indeed, would not happen until some 25 years later. Indonesia is a terrific
                    country of great strategic and economic importance to the U.S. But it's also a
                    country that senior policy-makers traditionally take for granted and lesser
                    policy-makers love to hate. We were thus embroiled in recurrent controversieEast
                    Timor, human rights, military assistance, economic aid, foreign investment and
                    the pulsating surges by boat of Vietnamese refugees throughout the region and
                    overland into Thailand.</p>
                <p>Q: So what about East Timor, which is now - we're talking about September 1999 -
                    very much in the headlines. Was that a factor or anything we paid attention
                    to?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: East Timor had not been an important issue when I served at embassy
                    Jakarta. But it became very important for TIMBS on human rights grounda key
                    tenet of the Carter Administration. We were called to the Hill frequently to
                    testify. I think it was Bob Oakley and Dick Holbrooke who originated the
                    Solomonic dictum that the U.S...” accepts the incorporation of East Timor into
                    Indonesia, while recognizing that a legitimate act of self determination has not
                    occurred.” Kissinger was accused of having turned a “blind eye” or given a
                    “green light” to the invasion.</p>
                <p>Now in 1999, it's clear that the Indonesian military and the militia it supports
                    are engaged in massive violence and human rights violations in East Timor. But
                    in 1977-79, the anti-Indonesian allegations about East Timor were highly
                    exaggerated, often lacked credibility, and were a convenient political platform
                    for persons opposed to our overall policy toward Indonesia.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>It may sound odd as we look at today's events, but I think our perspectives then
                    were accurate. In addition to other sources, ambassadors Galbraith and later
                    Masters were experienced in Indonesia and fluent in Indonesian. They visited the
                    island and wandered about independently as did other fluent embassy officers,
                    such as Harriet Isom. As a woman, she had some unique access. Many of the
                    allegations were overstated and unsupported. Even so, it was not a happy place,
                    despite the economic resources Indonesia poured in.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, we were often in the position in front of the House Foreign Affairs
                    Committee of arguing exactly 180 degrees from those who were recounting atrocity
                    stories. Many of the proponents were American professors from Cornell
                    University, who had links into East Timor and the various Portuguese priests.
                    One of them has just won the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
                <p>At that time, in our view, the situation was winding down. The Fretilin leader
                    was under loose house arrest and almost all the insurgents had surrendered or
                    faded away. Life on East Timor was generally calm, even though the Indonesian
                    Government was often high-handed. The recent collapse of Indonesia's economy and
                    the fall of Suharto have now reenergized the independence movement.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned Cornell. Almost every one I've interviewed who's dealt with
                    Indonesia, going back to the Sukarno times, talks about Cornell as being the
                    worm in the apple.</p>
                <p>FRITTS: It was a hotbed of historic revisionists. For me, iseparated academics
                    from objectivity.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, but they seem to have been able to capture... I guess nobody else paid
                    any attention to Indonesia, and being the only sort of academic institution
                    there that even thought about Indonesia, they seemed to be able to stand front
                    and center stage in the policy debates.</p>
                <p>FRITTS: To a degree. I'm now on the faculty at the College of William and Mary.
                    There and elsewhere, I've come to realize that scholars focused on a single
                    country or area are as or even more prone to “clientitis” as supposedly is the
                    Foreign Service. Their all-too-common stance is that U.S. policy toward their
                    area or country is wrong, ignorant, and out-of-touch with “the people.” In too
                    many cases, I suspect their stance is oriented more to their longer-term scholar
                    career access prospects than knowledge. I didn't know that at the time. I
                    naively worked hard at producing what I thought were objective facts. The
                    academics weren't interested and any State Department views considered as
                    self-serving as I considered theirs.</p>
                <p>Q: Although you were focused on Southeast Asia, were you picking up things within
                    the East Asian Bureau about the promise of the Carter Administration beforehand
                    about withdrawing the U.S. military from South Korea? I mean this had been an
                    election promise, and it was scary as hell to a lot of people, and it should
                    have had reverberations all over.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>FRITTS: I was aware only on the periphery. It would come up in the night-time
                    senior sessions with Dick Holbrooke, which I attended occasionally. Usually
                    there were Bob Oakley, Mort Abramowitz, deputy assistant secretary in
                    International Security Affairs (ISA) in Defense, Mike Armacost from the National
                    Security Council, etc. Mort was fighting inside DOD against a draw down, but he
                    had to be loyal outside in support of President Carter's announced intention.
                    Everyone thought a draw down would be disastrous for peace in Korea and
                    confidence in the region. I came to admire Mort Abramowitz a great deal both
                    then and later, when he became ambassador to Thailand. He was a true
                    professional in balancing loyalty with policy advocacy. He took a lot of heat
                    and his career was hurt by it.</p>
                <p>Let me add that Mort Abramowitz was a superb ambassador to Thailand. With the
                    assist of his wife, Sheppie, they were visible big-time in support of the
                    Vietnamese boat people. They deserve the highest humanitarian accolades.</p>
                <p>And Mort got one. I may be wrong, but I think it was the Medal of Freedom, about
                    the highest honor given by the American Government, for his role in saving
                    thousands of refugee lives. However, as you'll recall, the Carter Administration
                    ended with thIranian hostage situation and President Carter held no public
                    ceremonies. As a result, the medal was never awarded. When the Reagan
                    Administration came into office, they found things lying around, including his
                    medal. Because it was a President Carter remnant of unfinished business, a
                    Reagan staffer merely sent it over to State in a brown envelope in the
                    inter-departmental mail and that's how Mort received it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: The story is only hearsay, but my source was good. If ioccurred, it was a
                    great injustice.</p>
                <p>

                <p>FRITTS: From 1977 to 198three years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And where did you go then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: To the Bureau of Consular Affairs (CA).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, 1980, how did you get into Consular Affairs, known as
                        CA ?How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>FRITTS: I knew my tour as IMS country director was coming to an end. A friend in
                    Personnel tipped me that Barbara Watson, the assistant secretary for consular
                    affairs, was looking for a new principal deputy assistant secretary. I put my
                    name into the hat, was interviewed by her, and later notified I'd been
                    selected.</p>
                <p>The move was a surprise to Dick Holbrooke as he very much operated a
                    patron-client system. Generally, EA officers went to him to finagle favorable
                    onward assignments. I didn't think I was a favorite and also thought it beneath
                    my dignity to make a pitch to him. Indeed, his executive assistant phoned me
                    once, certainly on instruction, to intone that I wasn't hanging around Dick's
                    office enough at night being visible. In my view, Dick's deputy, Bob Oakley, was
                    whom I worked for directly. Bob was brilliant and efficient, had the Department
                    and interagency clout I frequently needed, and also filtered out the excesses of
                    Dick's impulsive creativity. I was working long hours, but also had a great
                    family. I didn't want to waste hours as a courtier, particularly as being around
                    Dick was always an unstructured experience. I attended when asked or thought it
                    useful, but it wasn't recreation.</p>
                <p>After my interview with Barbara, she called Dick to check me out. Dick, in turn,
                    then called me in a sort of mild shock. He said I was the first EA officer to go
                    out and negotiate an assignment “independently.” After that, I felt he regarded
                    me higher as our paths crossed in later years and as his fine contributions to
                    U.S. foreign policy expanded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your tour in consular affairs was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: From 1980 into 1983.</p>
                <p>Q: Talk a bit about assistant secretary Barbara Watson and how she operated. She
                    was a fairly important actor in the State Department in those days.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>FRITTS: My tenure in the bureau of consular affairs (CA) was under two assistant
                    secretaries, initially Barbara Watson and then Diego Asencio, who succeeded
                    Barbara when she became ambassador to Malaysia. Barbara, as you know well, set
                    the then-longevity record for a CA assistant secretary, about seven years, up
                    until the current one, Mary Ryan. She was the first African American woman to
                    have a high position at State. She was revered by many, respected by most, and
                    feared by some. She had deep Washington experience, an imposing personal
                    presence, a fine command of language and strong links to the Congress. She was
                    capable and skilled, but habitually cloaked her thoughts. She could be tough,
                    but seldom show her hand. Her favorite saying was, “You catch more bees with
                    honey than with vinegar.” She was very careful about CA relationships on the
                    Seventh Floor and with other bureaus and agencies, very cautious about
                    decisions, and hugged the sidelines on foreign policy issues affecting CA,
                    preferring to let them play out. I was her principal deputy for a little less
                    than a year, when she was nominated as ambassador to Malaysia. Departing CA was
                    very traumatic for her. She “owned” the bureau and it was her persona. She knew
                    Malaysia would not be the same. In fact, she avoided leaving her CA office for
                    as long as possible, always finding excuses for delay. As it turned out, her
                    ambassadorship lasted only a few months as Reagan defeated Carter.</p>
                <p>I respected Barbara and she was an effective defender of the traditional consular
                    profession. Being in charge for a long time, she developed a number of likes and
                    dislikes about officers, a number of whom she dead-ended. Some unfairly, I
                    thought.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, why was Barbara Watson, who had so much clout, so
                        careful,do you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, “Honey and Vinegar” was her mantra. Whether she felt that the
                    bureau was not strong enough or because as a woman and a minority she had to be
                    prudent, or because she got bounced out of office once in an election crunch, or
                    maybe she was just wise. But times were changing.</p>
                <p>Barbara had an enduring impact on consular affairs. She defended the function
                    when under siege, which was often. Her prestige and presumed Congressional
                    access were somewhat daunting to in-house and interagency adversaries,
                    particularly as she found ways to leave deft images of her Congressional favor.
                    She made it difficult for those who wished to undermine consular affairs,
                    budgetarily or otherwise, to proceed. She was a fine political public servant
                    during her extended tenure as CA assistant secretary.</p>
                <p>But times were changing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How so?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>FRITTS: I came into CA with a strong belief in its formal missions. But I also
                    felt CA did not meet its potential as a player in foreign policy. It needed to
                    be more foreign policy relevant and assertive. Its deep technical expertise
                    should not just exist in a vacuum, but be used for policy purposes.</p>
                <p>After a short while, I found there were consular officers, mostly younger, who
                    had the policy skills and smarts as well as consular expertise. They were tired
                    of being second fiddle to the powerful geographic bureaus on issues where their
                    knowledge was better or at least equal. I thus began to nudge and move the
                    bureau into a higher profile on foreign policy. I advocated that movements of
                    peoples should not be handled as afterthoughts of policy, but as legitimate
                    foreign policy interests. My view became stronger the longer I was there and
                    continues. Indeed, I'm still at it. I speak publicly on migration issues and
                    teach a course on international migrations and conflicts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's at the College of William and Mary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: That's correct. Barbara was not too pleased with my initiatives. In part,
                    I think she saw it as creating waves or, at least, ripples, which were not her
                    style. There also certainly were officers who resisted my push and whispered
                    into her ear. She took me to lunch on two occasions I recall and, in an
                    understated velvety way sheathed in steel, inferred I was overstepping my
                    bounds. I'm not surI would have lasted in CA if she had not gone off to
                    Malaysia.</p>
                <p>Q: I'd like to go into more detail about when you came in, what you perceived,
                    where you perceived the Consular Affairs Bureau and consular officers in
                    general, what they were doing, what they could do better, how it could be sort
                    of brought to a different level, and what you were trying to do.</p>
                <p>FRITTS: There were then, and still are, although attenuated, tensions between the
                    geographic bureaus, which perceive themselves as being at the cutting edge of
                    policy formulation, doing “substantive” work, and the functional bureaus, which
                    tended to have a higher proportion of civil service and were looked upon by the
                    geographic bureaus as specialized technical support. The geographic bureaus
                    handled policy within the context of countries and regions. The functional
                    bureaus were new and handled what came to be known later as transnational issues
                    - economics and international finance, human rights, science and the
                    environment, political-military, etc. But consular affairs had been around since
                    1782. Most FSOs had had their initial duty tour on a high-pressure traditional
                    visa line somewhere and many hadn't liked it.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>The geographic bureaus considered policy as their ordained prerogative. That view
                    began to change as economic affairs became more critical and with the obvious
                    rise of what came to be called globalization as a major foreign policy
                    challenge. Indeed, State was recently reorganized to reflect them. But at the
                    time I'm talking about, those were new ideas and by no means generally accepted.
                    And certainly not on the human migrations side. The typical geographic bureau
                    view was that CA should do whatever it was told at whatever level and without
                    riposte.</p>
                <p>I also found the CA culture defensive. Some officers took perverse pride in
                    digging in their heels on technical grounds as a sort of firewall between the
                    purity of their perspectives and the policy drumbeats of the Department. I felt
                    both views, geographic and CA, were often dysfunctional.</p>
                <p>The issue came up in varying guises, but even more so when Diego Asencio became
                    CA assistant secretary. He was a former ambassador, something of a national hero
                    following his extended hostage experience in Colombia, had an activist bent, and
                    was somewhat unconventional in how he approached CA issues within the bureau and
                    without. Diego also unleashed me to become Mr. Inside to his Topside and
                    Outside. A few fiefdoms were broken, younger officers of talent took heart,
                    other bureaus found us a player, and CA began to change.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you feel when you left, around 1983 that the corps of consular officers
                    was beginning to be more assertive and policy oriented?</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>FRITTS: Very much so, and it was not only anything that I particularly did, but,
                    I'll say it again, times were changing. We had become a policy player on the
                    Irish Republic Army and the Ulsterists, South Africa, Soviet-proxy
                    organizations, such as the World Peace Council, the Soviet Bloacross the board.
                    CA now had some policy respect. Our efforts aside, the conceptual reason was
                    that foreign policy challenges were becoming more and more transnational (a new
                    term then), rather than just geographically focused. There was increasing
                    recognition that, particularly with the catalysts of the Vietnamese boat people
                    as refugees, which threatened to destabilize Southeast Asia, plus the Cuban
                    Mariel exodus to the United States, that movements of people were a permanent
                    major foreign policy catalyst of issues. Control or manage the movements and you
                    can manage policy outcomes. Indeed, the later fall of the Berlin Wall; the
                    liberation of Eastern Europe and the collapse of the Soviet Union can arguably
                    be traced to the emigrations out of East Germany and Bulgaria, which Gorbachev
                    decided not to confront forcefully. My view was and is that mass migrations are
                    both a cause and result of international conflict. They should be viewed as an
                    adjustable factor in foreign policy rather than any ad hoc aftermath. If that
                    premise is valid, then CA is a policy bureau. In my view, getting active was no
                    sacrifice to the integrity of the traditional consular role. We made better
                    inputs to the conduct of foreign policy by having our oar in at the beginning of
                    policy debate rather than being defensive against decisions at the end. But it
                    was difficult to move CA into anticipatory analysis and policy advocacy. The
                    bureau was also notorious for detailed legalese in memos I knew wouldn't be read
                    by Principals; indeed, wouldn't even reach them. We needed officers who thought
                    policy and could put it into concise, readable, relevant prose.</p>
                <p>As I dipped down, I found there were younger officers who welcomed opportunities
                    to engage. As time went on, I was gratified to find more and more who had the
                    smarts and drafting skills to be policy competitive. I had occasional
                    resentment, of course, from some supervisors of those officers, but there were
                    benign ways to handle that. I've had pleasure in later years in seeing those
                    officers in senior Foreign Service positions across the board, not just in
                    consular affairs.</p>
                <p>Q: There are three general functions of consular operations. One is the
                    protection of Americans, called American Services - the problems of Americans
                    overseas - two is visas, and three, passports. Let's deal with the passport one
                    first. To my mind it almost ceased to be much of anything but a pretty cut and
                    dried thing, because new laws made it very difficult to lose citizenship. Thus
                    the whole focus became getting passports out in time to people.</p>
                <p>FRITTS: It's true that the passport function was the least policy-oriented
                    function. The challenge was to develop a credible, technologically modern and
                    fraud-resistant document and distribute it to citizens in a timely and
                    cost-effective manner. In the millions. One thing we did was to get
                    Congressional and Treasury/OMB support to hike the fee by two or three times and
                    retain part of it to help cover costs. The fee hadn't been changed since the
                    '50s. While not much involved day-by-day, I realized it was a highly visible
                    public face of State to the American people and the Congress. And that the
                    public's view of foreign policy credibility could be affected by our image.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>Q: Moving to the visa function, here is a place where CA and our posts have
                    hundreds of contacts with Congress every day. I would think we could be
                    influential very early on in any reform of nationality and immigration laws. We
                    must have had very good contacts in Congress.</p>
                <p>FRITTS: We dion both sides of the aisle. And with Diego's lead we influenced the
                    Special Commission on Immigration Reform, which led to the 1986 Immigration
                    &amp; Reform Act. Diego jumped into it with lots of substantive ideas and a
                    desire to leave an imprint on immigration reform in a manner to enhance U.S.
                    foreign policy. Being the son of an immigrant from Argentina, it also meant much
                    to him personally. As I said, he came into CA with a hero's image and media
                    acclaim. He therefore had a “name” and was politically untouchable. Real
                    assets.</p>
                <p>He formed a small select CA group on immigration reform, including B. J. Harper,
                    Dick Scully, Dick McCoy and a few others. B. J. Harper and Dick Scully were
                    respected national experts. Also fine persons. B.J. was Foreign Service; Dick
                    Civil Service. They were a great tandem who had worked together for years. Their
                    rare forte was to anticipate and forestall unintended consequences by devising
                    new policies or redesigning others' initiatives. The little group had major
                    impact. Diego spent a lot of time on the Hill networking, testifying, working
                    interest groups, etc. We were fortunate that the chairmen of the Senate and
                    House immigration sub-committees, Senator Alan Simpson (Republican-Wyoming.) and
                    Congressman Ron Mazzoli (Democrat-Kentucky.), were very intelligent and public
                    policy motivated. They listened to us and were respected in their party
                    caucuses. Simpson was just pure fun to work with, offering continual quips and
                    punchy insights on people, politics and policies. My only role was to keep up
                    enough that I could be thrown into a breach if Diego were abroad or elsewhere.
                    Barbara Watson would not have taken the high level active participation that
                    Diego did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Visa fraud is an endemic problem. Was that high on your
                        screen?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>FRITTS: One of the things I took to hand, to a degree under Barbara, but more so
                    under Diego, was a CA-wide Anti-Fraud Program. One of CA's problems was that the
                    culture saw itself not unreasonably as three separate entities - passports,
                    visas and citizens services. But the separations were sometimes dysfunctional.
                    For example, we had three separate anti-fraud programs, which went their
                    independent ways, often wastefully and somewhat capriciously. Part of the
                    impetus was my belief that unless we had effective, coherent, anti-fraud
                    programs, the bureau could be discredited by some scam, not only in the eyes of
                    the public and Congress, but also on the Seventh Floor, which would derail any
                    emerging credibility on the policy side. I thus put myself in charge and
                    empowered Donna Hamilton - who was also frustrated - to pursue it. The effort
                    was looked upon with askance by many. But with persistence from Donna, Michelle
                    Truitt and a few others, there was real progress. Indeed, the GAO at one point
                    announced a formal review of our anti-fraud efforts. A team came over, looked
                    around and canceled the review.</p>
                <p>Some years later officers who were involved would come up to say how they
                    welcomed the process for what it had accomplished, not only in anti- fraud
                    terms, but in bringing CA more together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any fraud trends that became acute?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: The fall of Iran with the overthrow of the Shah was a challenge. Tens of
                    thousands of Iranians flooded primarily into European posts with a great deal of
                    money for bribes, sophisticated fraud techniques and, sometimes, influential
                    American sponsors and interested parties. The U.S. was the destination of
                    choice. Some posts were virtually inundated. The Iranians were proficient in
                    visa-shopping from post to post, trying to find cracks and niches for approvals.
                    Attempted bribes, both of FSNs and officers, were frequent. One officer endeared
                    herself to me by adopting the technique of shaking hundreds and even thousands
                    of dollars out of visa applications onto the floor for the applicants to
                    retrieve in full view of others in line. Naturally, we also had fraud
                    allegations against our own people. Investigations uncovered a few miscreants,
                    mostly FSNs.</p>
                <p>We also had an in-State problem as many of the Iranians were well connected with
                    prominent Americans inside and out of government. We thus had anumber of appeals
                    and irresponsible charges against officers who refused to issue certain visas.
                    The NSC and parts of the Congress were quite insistent that we provide a
                    favorable visa climate for Iranians fleeing Iran. Our consuls and I plus Diego
                    came to see it as increasingly unnecessary and a perversion of law. We went
                    high-profile and, much to our surprise, got the policy revised. We tightened up,
                    but still made liberal allowances for persecuted minorities, such as the Bahais
                    and Iranian Jews.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>Which reminds me. We took a lead role in implementing the departure of Falasha or
                    so-called Black Jews from Ethiopia to Israel via U.S. auspices. They were
                    fascinating historically as a supposed “lost tribe,” Queen of Sheba and all
                    that. The program was quite successful and the Israelis swallowed hard, but
                    accepted the racial difference even though, I think, not fully accepting the
                    religious foundation. Some years later I was in Israel and felt good about all
                    the Ethiopians I saw working there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Congress has traditionally followed visa issuances
                        closely.Did you find that true?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Every ear we issued or denied visas in the millions and the Congress
                    challenged those decisions by the thousandalong with threats by Congressional
                    staffers seeking to bend the laws for constituents, including foreign friends of
                    constituents. One learned quickly that while favorable decisions were presumably
                    a good thing, they better be justifiable and legal. To knowingly issue a false
                    visa is a felony and a jail term. Negative decisions, of course, led to
                    Congressional and citizen charges of stupidity, sloth and bureaucracy. But we
                    knew that any benefitted Member would be the first to plead innocence and lay
                    blame on a consular officer if a flap occurred. It was important to be
                    responsive for review queries, but absolutely imperative to maintain the
                    integrity of visa decisions. Consular officers, because they were so frequently
                    importuned by Americans and foreigners to subvert the visa process or bend the
                    laws, resisted reviews. Keeping balance in the field was thus a management
                    issue, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this work? How did you handle cases where there
                        was lot of pressure in Washington to issue a visa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: There were two kinds of cases: A few with major foreign policy impact and
                    the thousands from the Hill relayed from constituents. Sometimes the Member or
                    Senator was his or her own constituent.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>The foreign policy cases pertained primarily to U.S. adversaries and
                    controversial insurgents, usually combined with human rights concerns.
                    Occasionally, visiting the U.S. for access to the UN would be the issue. U.S.
                    leeway was quite restricted by the UN Headquarters agreement in favor of access.
                    Yasser Arafat, for example, was a repeated focus as were South American
                    insurgent leaders. Interagency debate could be contentious within and among
                    State, Justice, INS, the intelligence agencies and the White House. There would
                    be pitted political dialogues with the Congress between those who wished to keep
                    the person out and those who wished him/her in. CA, the keeper of the visa
                    flame, was by definition a hurdle. State, except for us, might believe the visa
                    imperative for expedient policy reasons. CA might believe issuance illegal.
                    Sometimes the Secretary might have to make the decision, but wouldn't want to.
                    He wanted the CA assistant secretary to do so in order to neutralize political
                    flak. What I tried to strengthen was CA ability to think the issues through in
                    broader contexts and have an impact, rather than just provide reflexive legal
                    cover.</p>
                <p>For the blizzard of daily Congressional queries, we had standard referral system
                    where the post would be instructed to review the case and report why it made the
                    decision it did. About 90% of the queries came from young staffers and were
                    boilerplate.</p>
                <p>On occasion, a Member or Senator would get a bit in their teeth. I recall when
                    the chairman of a House subcommittee wanted a visa issued to a particular
                    Italian chef to work at a K Street restaurant in which the Member had blind
                    ownership. The business was about to fail and he thought this particular chef
                    would be its savior. He put a lot of pressure on Diego, who really wanted to
                    issue the visa. There were several one-on-one sessions with no staff present.
                    Diego finally told the Member there was no way he could get the visa issued
                    without violating the law. The Member got the message.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why the tension? Weren't visa officers responsive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Only up to a point. As you will recall, the Immigration and Nationality
                    Act (INA) gives consuls supreme authority to decide visas - “adjudicate” is the
                    technical term. Neither the secretary of state nor an ambassador can just order
                    a visa issued. Political ambassadors often don't understand that their writ is
                    limited. Visa officers can be quite jealous of their prerogative and don't
                    hesitate to blow whistles.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>Another factor was that the CA advisory legal folk, in my view, were too often
                    inflexible. So much easier to advise “No” than “Yes.” On the other hand, the
                    laws and formulae are extraordinarily complex; equal at least to the tax Code.
                    Individual human conditions are infinitely variable. I remember a big go-around
                    on whether an Englishman, who had been barred from the U.S. because of a
                    homosexual conviction and become permanently ineligible on grounds of “moral
                    turpitude,” had become eligible following a sex change operation to a woman. And
                    while we tried to ensure a close degree of consistency worldwide, one size never
                    fit all. There's always room for interpretation. That's why we have consuls
                    overseas. But some applicants are adept at “visa-shopping” - looking for posts
                    with reputations for flexibility or an inexperienced officer.</p>
                <p>Q: You talked about the Congress. Was there a difference in dealing with Congress
                    between Diego Asencio, when you were working with him, or with Barbara Watson
                    when you were working with her? Congressmen all the time want to get visas
                    issued to friends of constituents or something like that. Did each handle it
                    differently?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: As with all things Congressional, Barbara kept much of that close to her
                    chest, so I wasn't much involved. But the little I saw struck me as prudent and
                    conservative. It t'were done, t'were done skillfully.</p>
                <p>Diego was different. He was by nature a negotiator and trader. He liked to
                    challenge orthodoxy. He valued personal good will and had several personal
                    relationships inside the Congress, even before he became CA. He was always
                    willing to look at cases brought by high-ranking congressmen and especially by
                    those who oversaw our budget and operations. He saw quids and quos as the grease
                    of government. But at the end of the day, his decisions were about the same, as
                    in the case of the visa-for-a-chef I mentioned previously. But his in-house
                    ruminations and questions left some officers discomfited.</p>
                <p>In a lesser vein, I recall Diego once delayed for weeks a favorable response to a
                    request by Tom Tracey, the Assistant Secretary of Administration, to issue a
                    dozen diplomatic passports for Marines working temporarily at Embassy Moscow.
                    Tracey came under increasingly irate pressure from DOD. But Diego held firm
                    because he wanted to have our disreputable visa offices across the street
                    painted and Tracey had refused to authorize it some months earlier. Diego waited
                    out the DOD escalations on Tracey and then finally agreed to sanction the
                    passports, if Tracey would fund the paint job. After the deal, which Diego
                    thought would be a morale coup, he announced his finesse at an open luncheon
                    meeting of the Consular Association. Instead of appreciation, there was a
                    firestorm of protests from officers whose delegations wound up in my office.
                    They believed the integrity of CA and diplomatic passports had been sullied by
                    the “sale.” It heightened suspicion that Diego would trade other things as
                    well.</p>

                        relationshiwith Diego.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Very much so. Diego shared my view in terms of the need fothe bureau to
                    become more policy oriented and responsive.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, as you know, I was a working consular officer most of my career, and one
                    of the things I learned rather early on was don't ask Washington for an opinion
                    unless you wanted it negative. If there's a reason you want to stall and
                    essentially not issue a visa, sure, ask for an opinion, otherwise go ahead and
                    issue it.</p>
                <p>FRITTS: That principle can apply to a lot of issues, not jusconsular.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the third CA function - American services and the overseas
                    protection of Americans? Were there any major initiatives or crises that hit CA
                    during this time?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, the Iranian revolution occurred and we had the usual task force
                    facilitating the exodus of Americans. Later on, of course, our Embassy
                    colleagues were taken hostage, but their release was not a CA issue. We served
                    on a number of other similar task forces, Grenada, Panama, Cuba and others.</p>
                <p>A frustrating and recurring issue was the, in effect, kidnaping of American
                    citizen children by foreign spouses, often but not exclusively from the Middle
                    East. All we could offer was quiet diplomacy. There were successes, but not
                    enough.</p>
                <p>I felt that overseas citizens' services was probably the most fun and rewarding
                    consular activity. I believed strongly then, and do now, that the protection of
                    Americans overseas, with all its variety, is the basic justification for the
                    American Foreign Service. I consult with the Joint Forces Staff College in
                    Norfolk and I emphasize there that the first two conflicts this country fought
                    after the Revolution were to a large degree to protect Americans overseas - the
                    War of 1812 and the Barbary Coast wars. In this day and age, senior military
                    planners must know that one of the top priorities in an ambassador's mind is the
                    safety and well-being of the American citizens in any particular country - that
                    they be evacuated, if necessary, that they not be taken hostage, and if they are
                    taken hostage, that they be released either peacefully or forcefully. I believe,
                    having watched other countries and their treatment of nationals, that the United
                    States is by far the country which takes the protection of its citizens most to
                    heart and won't sacrifice them to our foreign policy interests. It's a hallmark
                    of our American culture and what Americans expect. And it's CA which holds the
                    lamp. So much for “The Speech.”</p>
                <p>Q: Did you have problems in the field in driving this point home? Because I've
                    seen times where ambassadors have been very reluctant to take up the plight of
                    an American in jail when it reached the point where it really needed fairly high
                    representation because there were always other policy matters involved and
                    all.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>FRITTS: Sure. And, at times, properly so. But there's alwayflexibility on the
                    scene of how to carry out instructions effectively.</p>
                <p>Q: In that regard, were there any tensions between CA and its requirement to
                    protect Americans who were in jail, often on drug charges, with the Bureau of
                    Narcotics and other enforcement agencies?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Not much with the agencies. Congress, however, exercised close oversight
                    of visits to imprisoned Americans. Their relatives and friends kept the pressure
                    on. Also usually claiming that the prisoner was innocent.</p>
                <p>Those visits can become professionally controversial when the Americans in prison
                    are thugs. To what degree should we use political goodwill and diplomatic
                    resources to protect those who have violated laws, international and local, in
                    heinous kinds of ways? Such as drug trafficking and murder? That's difficult for
                    many officers and ambassadors to accept. But it's our duty.</p>
                <p>For example, we had numerous American prisoners in Bangkok on narcotics
                    convictions. Our mandate was to ensure that they received at least a minimum of
                    acceptable living standards and necessities, which we would supplement, such as
                    vitamins. These guys were not innocents and some were extremely violent. But
                    Congress mandated a minimum frequency of prison visits worldwide because of
                    perceived CA inattention here and there, particularly in Turkey. Relatives of
                    prisoners always worked the Congress for better treatment.</p>
                <p>But the Congressional requirement was global. We kept trying to reduce the amount
                    of time that consuls had to give to prison visits where conditions were O.K.,
                    and in some places, excellent. In Sweden, I recall, we had to send a consul
                    quarterly on a ten-day journey by rail to a town in the Arctic Circle in order
                    to visit one American prisoner. Several times when the officer arrived, the
                    “prisoner” was “on leave.” A nice trip for the officer, but a waste.</p>
                <p>We negotiated treaties or agreements with some countries to permit Americans to
                    serve out their terms in the U.S. It amused me how many American prisoners, if
                    given the offer to returning to the U.S., even from Mexico, refused to do so.
                    Any prisoner with funds from the “outside” had perks few Americans had in our
                    prisons, such as conjugal visits, including prostitutes, catered meals, TVs,
                    special furniture and even outside excursions. Without funds, of course, foreign
                    prisons could be tougbut so, in most cases, were the crimes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about evacuations of Americans in danger? FRITTS:
                        Often and frequent. And we do it well.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>An interesting aspect is the moral issue when Americans citizens refuse to
                    evacuate a dangerous situation when encouraged officially to do so. What is the
                    USG responsibility for those who choose to remain in-country, be they
                    missionaries, businessmen or young hikers? Although not then in CA, I recall the
                    bombing of Tripoli in about 1984, when we encouraged Americans in Libya to leave
                    because of a pending military strike against Libya. Many Americans decided to
                    stay because they were employed by Libyan oil firms and received Libyan
                    Government assurances they would be well treated and even receive bonuses. They
                    stayed and we bombed. No American casualties, but I'm sure it affected our
                    targeting.</p>
                <p>If we encourage Americans to leave a country and they refuse, and they then
                    become captured, injured or killed, to what degree can we say, “Well, we warned
                    them, but they wouldn't leave”? The answer is no matter they made bad decisions,
                    they're American citizens and the USG, particularly an American ambassador,
                    remains fully responsible for their protection and welfare. In briefings at the
                    Joint Forces Staff College, military officers find that stance hard to accept,
                    but it's an ethical fact for military as well as civilian authorities. And if
                    the media or Congress perceive us as callow in that regard, we will be
                    forcefully reminded.</p>
                <p>Q: I think you were probably the first political officer to be the Principal DAS.
                    Did you find that you were a bit of a fish out of water or had trouble getting
                    accepted?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, actually, I was neither. I had been an economic officer by cone.The
                    first political officer to be Principal DAS was Hume Horan, whom I succeeded.
                    Hume did things differently than I did. He was, in essence, an advisor to
                    Barbara Watson on foreign policy matters. In contrast, I was operational and
                    wanted to put CA into policy institutionally.As for acceptance, sure, one had to
                    earn credibility, but there are techniques for doing that. The fact that no
                    consular officer had ever been Principal DAS implied that senior consular
                    officers were somehow second rate and not capable of driving policy. Like many
                    stereotypes, there was just enough truth to perpetuate it. Many otherwise
                    capable senior consular officers had neither the experience nor the desire for
                    high-profile policy engagement. However, when I left CA, I felt we identified a
                    cadre of officers who had the talent and ambition to do more. The need for such
                    skills was increasingly apparent and the culture began to shift. In fact,
                    several years later a consular officer became Principal DAS and it's been that
                    way ever since. I feel some gratification that she and her successors are
                    officers whom I plucked up. A certain legacy, perhaps.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find relations with officers in the field? I think consular
                    officers feel closer to CA as sort of a professional home than do officers
                    relating to the geographic bureaus.</p>
                <p>FRITTS: That's true and we tried to reinforce it. After all, consular officers
                    have most if not all of their career assignments made by CA. Other officers
                    usually serve in several geographic bureaus.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>But there was a downside. In serving as DCM and ambassador, I emphasized
                    integrating Consular Sections into the Country Team as full participants.
                    Frankly, it sometimes didn't take, which I also later saw when inspecting our
                    posts. Too many consular officers, including Consuls General, would complain
                    about being outsiders, but they didn't want to be bothered with policy. They
                    wanted to be left alone to run their business without “interference.” Granted,
                    they were often beset by already heavy workloads.</p>
                <p>But I felt they could and should do both. I appreciated, however, that some
                    officers found great psychic satisfaction, as a research scholar would, in the
                    detailed theological interpretations of issuing visas. They wanted to be left
                    along to be arcane experts of a discrete function. That was fine in its place,
                    but I didn't believe they were or should be future leaders of CA. And time
                    proved it.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find CA management, because during the period not too long before
                    you came in, the consular operation was probably the only element of the
                    Department of State that organized and manipulated complex data. And personal
                    computers were still rare. I think the computerized budget analysis was called
                    the “Consular Packet” or something like that. Was this a handy tool?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: I felt that the determination and allocation of CA resources to needs was
                    about the most complex of any bureau of that time. Between visas and passports,
                    we ran two global service businesses, which manufactured and processed
                    productpassports and visafor distribution by domestic and overseas offices. In
                    the millions.</p>
                <p>Some computerized techniques were innovative for their time. Only recently I ran
                    across separately two retired senior Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
                    officers who each commented that he always gave CA presentations high marks and
                    presumed to give us what we asked. Wish I had known it then!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in preparing the CA budget and were
                        there lotof internal tensions in dong so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: No, I was not deeply involved in preparing the budget. Whad a very strong
                    executive director.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ron Somerville.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>FRITTS: Ron Somerville, who was very effective, skilled and crafty. I sat in on
                    the review sessions and made my points, but was not much engaged in the internal
                    tugs-of-war. Ron took most of that heat. It was my job to take the team to OMB
                    and justify our line items with them and with Hill staffers. Diego worked the
                    Seventh Floor, the Hill committees and testified.</p>
                <p>Q: During this time you had several secretaries of state - Vance, Muskie and
                    Haig. Did you feel there was any change when the Reagan Administration came in
                    or didn't it really involve CA?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Once Diego was informed he would remain as CA, we were relatively immune.
                    Indeed, the disinterest in consular affairs was about the same under all three
                    of them.</p>
                <p>Along that line, I wrote what I called my “Strike Three Memo” to Muskie and Haig
                    at times when I was acting assistant secretary. I don't think either ever saw
                    it. It challenged the Department's chronic lament that it had no domestic
                    constituencies and thus lackeCongressional clout and public support. I thought
                    that view false, that we had a lot of public interaction and could leverage it.
                    As we've noted, CA had thousands of productive contacts annually with American
                    citizens and the Congress on passports, protection and welfare of Americans
                    overseas, and facilitating visas. We were the public services face of the
                    Department. I solicited from posts and within CA a bundle of human-interest
                    vignettes. Most showed officer initiative far and beyond the call of dutmany
                    were heartwarming, others tear jerking. I thought it a persuasive pitch for a
                    joint program by the bureaus of Public Affairs and Congressional Affairs. If
                    exploited, I felt we could create the image of the Foreign Service and the
                    Department of State as a truly American outfit run for Americans and thus assist
                    our foreign policy pursuits. But nothing came of it. I later sent it to
                    Secretary Shultz when I was Deputy Inspector General. I'm confident he never saw
                    it either. Three Strikes and Out. A wasted opportunity.</p>
                <p>Q: As for the Secretaries...</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Vance departed shortly after I went to CA. Barbara Watson believed she
                    had good access and I know she respected him. But other than that...</p>
                <p>Secretary Muskie had very little impact, from my perspective, upon either CA or
                    the Department. His work habits were lackadaisical and he tended to look as a
                    senator would upon the Bureau of Consular Affairs - an office to be used for the
                    Secretary's constituent services. He was there only a short time.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>Secretary Haig was also a relative short-timer. But he was in the seat during the
                    process leading to the 1986 Immigration &amp; Reform Act. Diego briefed him a
                    couple of times. His interest was minimal. At one point, Diego was away when a
                    Cabinet meeting was scheduled to discuss a draft of several proposals. I
                    briefeHaig for about an hour on the principles and inter-agency controversies,
                    which he sort of suffered through. But he was sufficiently uneasy that he
                    directed me to attend the Cabinet session with him in the White House, which, of
                    course, I was pleased to do. While fun, I was somewhat appalled, because the
                    more vociferous Cabinet members were the least knowledgeable. Even those I
                    thought knew better, like the Attorney General and Secretaries of Commerce and
                    Agriculture, merely pontificated on pet themes and theories. It confirmed why
                    American Presidents don't rely much on Cabinet government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in around '83, you left. Whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: To Ghana as ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: 1983 to 1986.</p>
                <p>Q: Before you went out to Ghana, what were you getting from the Department, from
                    the African Bureau, about our interests in Ghana and what needed to be done?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Ghana had a very long history of a close relationship with the United
                    States. It was the first country in Africa to become independent, in 1957. It
                    was the first country to receive American Peace Corps Volunteers. Ghana under
                    its first prime minister, Kwame Nkrumah, had become what was called the “Black
                    Star of Africa.” During those early years of promise, he had attracted many of
                    the best and the brightest of the American African community to look upon a new
                    day in Africa with Ghana as the potential leader of a unified Africa. None of
                    that came to pass, of course.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>By the time I was preparing to go out, there had been a number of governments in
                    Ghana, often short-lived, led by military generals, and even under occasional
                    parliamentary processes, there had been endemic corruption and malfeasance. That
                    had led to a coup earlier in the year bFlight Lieutenant Jerry Rawlings, who had
                    taken power briefly and then turned it back over to a civilian government. A few
                    months later, in Rawlings's view, that government had also not measured up, so
                    he staged a second coup on the same grounds as the first. He then executed two
                    previous military presidents and imprisoned the latest elected president. He was
                    embarked upon a revolution under what was called the Provisional National
                    Defense Council (PNDC). It was radical socialist in its approaches to the
                    country's economic, social, and political problems. Rawlings saw Libya and Cuba
                    as models. The Soviet Union had rising influence. Rawlings was intrigued by
                    radical revolutionary regimes in Africa and the world.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Tom Smith. He had worked very closely with the previous parliamentary
                    government overthrown by Rawlings. Tom was crestfallen over developments. He
                    waited and waited for the opportunity of a normal farewell call on Rawlings as
                    the new head of state/head of government, but it never happened. He even missed
                    his daughter's graduation from his alma mater, Harvard. U.S.-Ghanaian relations
                    were at a very low point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you see as what you were going to do when you
                        went outhere in '83?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, there's a process of developing an ambassador's mission statement
                    with goals and objectives, but I didn't want to develop a whole new policy
                    approach before even stepping foot in the place. The situation was also volatile
                    as Rawlings in his “second coming” had only been in power for several months. As
                    you know, ambassadors try to write their own instructions, which they then seek
                    to implement. I thus gave myself some breathing room, saying essentially that I
                    wanted to assess the situation on the ground first and would report in 90 days
                    or so with a prescription as to what policies we might pursue.</p>
                <p>I was very fortunate that the assistant secretary for African affairs, Chet
                    Crocker, whom I didn't know, was more than amenable. I wrote up a formal memo of
                    instructions within a conceptual policy framework. Of course, I had worked it
                    out within the African Bureau and incorporated those aspects which made sense to
                    me with other bureaus, departments and agencies.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>When I saw Crocker shortly before departing, he gave a cursory scan of the
                    document and then gave me orally the absolutely best instructions any American
                    ambassador could ever desire. His words were, “I don't think much can be done in
                    Ghana. But go out, see what might be done, and don't take any guff.” And he used
                    a word other than guff. In other words, I had carte blanche to do my thing. He
                    also said that if I concluded the situation was hopeless, then draw down the
                    embassy staff and maybe close the embassy. If I thought something could be done,
                    come up with proposals. In the interim, do what I thought was necessary and
                    maybe just tell the Department afterwards. One could not ask for more. Going
                    back to our earlier conversation - for me, another ship was about to get
                    underway and with some independence. Real responsibility.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, now, I take it that at this time, Ghana did not rank very high in
                    American policy. It had been, since the late '50s, as you say, that the “Black
                    Star” was there, but by this time, did it have any real constituency in the
                    United States? Were we concerned about it? Did we have any strategic
                    concerns?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Naturally we had the usual concerns we had throughout Africa during the
                    Cold War. Under the PNDC, one could anticipate that Ghanaian votes in the United
                    Nations would be primarily with our adversaries. We knew that the climate for
                    American investment was now even worse. There was no rule of law worth much.
                    There were major human rights considerations, because there had been killings
                    and purges and shutting down of a free press. Supreme Court judges had been
                    murdered in suspicious circumstances. We were concerned over an expanding wedge
                    of Russian, Chinese, Libyan and Cuban influences and that Ghana could become a
                    platform to destabilize West Africa. Key members of Rawlings's entourage,
                    including his chief of security, had fought with Samora Michel in Angola. The
                    idea of radical revolution expanding in Africa and affecting our access to
                    strategic resources and to military bases was all part of Cold War tensions. We
                    also thought that Ghana had a special history and Ghanaians proven skills, which
                    if freed and supported, could reverse its downward economic spiral and create a
                    more open political system. Ghana was thus an integral part of U.S. interests in
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived in Accra, what was your impression of
                        thembassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>FRITTS: The embassy staff, frankly, was only a skeleton. Staff had been pulled
                    out without replacements, who would not come in for some months. The carry-over
                    DCM overlapped only 10 days and then departed early with prior Dept. approval.
                    The few FSOs were, in general, inexperienced. It was one of those cyclical dips
                    that affect many posts in the developing world. I felt singularly alone in
                    trying to figure out who was who, what was going on, and what we should be
                    doing. It seemed incredible that the world's superpower had such a dysfunctional
                    disinterest, particularly at smaller posts in difficult places where, in fact,
                    there are no back-ups. State was the problem. USIA, AID and DOD did better. Over
                    time the State quality also improved as FSO bidders learned in corridor gossip
                    that Ghana was not a pit. I helped recruit persons by saying we had career
                    opportunities in an improving situation. My premise was that in Ghana, you could
                    have impact. At the end of the day and tour, you could say, “Yes, this is what
                    I/we sought to achieve and this is what was accomplished (or not).” You wouldn't
                    get lost in a larger embassy where individual achievement was muddled,
                    professional growth diffuse and psychic reward lacking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Watch officers on a destroyer again.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Maybe. In addition, the embassy location was in downtown Accra. Given the
                    increasingly politically hostile environment, Ambassador Smith had made the
                    correct decision to relocate to our more defensible and underutilized USAID
                    building. We had thus begun to quietly renovate that building on the Ring Road
                    outside of downtown. I accelerated the plan. Much of the work was by our own
                    efforts with technical specialists rotating in and out. In essence, we built an
                    embassy inside the AID building without the Ghanaian Government being alert to
                    it. After several months, we delivered a note to the Foreign Ministry after it
                    had closed on Friday, indicating we would reopen for business on Monday in the
                    new location. Over the weekend, we moved the embassy lock, stock, and barrel
                    from the chancery downtown to the renovated building. We had dropped off the
                    note late assuming no Ghanaian official would read it until Monday and thus be
                    unable to interfere or interrupt the movements of our vehicles carrying
                    classified equipment and files. We probably made a hundred sorties using motor
                    pool vehicles and our personal cars. There was no incident, but we had Marines
                    in civilian clothes riding along in case the convoys were challenged. We were
                    proud of the accomplishment. We felt there was some danger in it all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would there be opposition? Why did it have to be
                        donsurreptitiously?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>FRITTS: I didn't trust the Ghanaian Government at that time. They'd been in
                    office less than six months. There were some very unsavory folk in the “Castle”
                    the seat of governmenwho were ideologues, impulsive and armed. Anti-American
                    vitriol was official. I knew Rawlings had contempt for the Reagan Administration
                    and my predecessor. The U.S., wrongly, was considered opposed to the PNDC. There
                    was a wide-spread Ghanaian belief going back to the old Nkrumah period that
                    somehow the CIA was the arbiter of U.S. policy in Ghana and that we were
                    involved in seeking to overthrow the PNDC. My concerns were based on
                    intelligence and other sources, that for us to give the Ghanaian Government
                    advance notice could be twisted by their security group's paranoia into
                    temptations to interfere, such as by detaining our vehicles which were carrying
                    cryptographic equipment, classified material and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we also feel that our embassy had been pretty well
                        exposed tlistening devices and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Sure. The embassy had received a design prize at one time in the '50s, I
                    guess, as one of the then-new embassies, which reflected an idealized
                    host-country architectural style and used local products. Our offices fronted
                    onto a second-floor square veranda that overlooked an open courtyard. The walls
                    were made primarily of local mahogany and plywood. We were enveloped by much
                    taller government buildings. The logical assumption was that we had no
                    communications security whatsoever, even for spoken conversations. So, yes, that
                    was also one of the reasons we decided to relocate.</p>
                <p>There was also an overall security issue as the chancery grounds had been open
                    and were now only fenced off with wire. Being in the heart of downtown, we were
                    exposed to mass demonstrations, if ginned up by the government. We were also on
                    the main track to and from the soccer stadium and thus an additional potential
                    target for unruly crowds, which could be induced. Some Ghanaians were also
                    intimidated to visit the chancery for fear of observation from the government
                    offices. The list of concerns was long.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your estimate, after your reading up and getting started, on
                    Rawlings? Who was he? Where was he coming from? Could he be dealt with?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Rawlings was an enigmatic figure. Over the course of my time there, I got
                    to know him fairly well - to the degree that an official American could and, in
                    truth, far better than any Western ambassador there.</p>
                <p>He was a populist mystialmost messianic. He had, as did many African
                    revolutionary leaders, overtones of a prophet. Very nationalistic and patriotic.
                    Quite idealistic, but through an anti-Western lens. Also sincerely desirous, I
                    thought, of improving the lives of ordinary Ghanaians, but the models he then
                    found appealing were Cuba and Libya. And he was feted by Castro and Qadhafi with
                    whom he developed kindred relationships.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>His was an unusual personality. There was no normal flow of conversatioa lot of
                    in's and out's and elliptical phrases. I sensed he often held back as not
                    trusting what he might say. He was emotional, unpredictable and quick to judge
                    on what I thought poor or limited information. In short, someone to be careful
                    with. I thought how difficult it was for his ministers and staff. They weren't
                    sure when they might inadvertently offend him. None of them ever said that to
                    me, of course, but I observed their nervous behavior if, for example, asked a
                    question from out of the blue.</p>
                <p>He detested forms of Western protocol as being artificial and imposed. That was
                    okay by me, but bent European ambassadors out of shape. For example, he
                    generally would not receive credentials of new ambassadors and was choosy in
                    whom he saw at departure. I presented my credentials to one of the members of
                    his five or seven-person PNDC senior team, a Mrs. Annan, I think. A pleasant
                    figurehead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how did you get to know him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: A well-connected Ghanaian businessman sought me out to suggest that it
                    might he useful if I were to meet with the “Chairman.” I knew the businessman
                    was reliable, as he had been mentioned to me by former ambassador Shirley Temple
                    Black, a predecessor twice removed. He inferred there were those who felt a
                    rapprochement with the U.S. was important. Naturally, I said “Sure.” The result
                    over some months was a series of meetings at the businessman's home in a
                    close-by Ghanaian town and once at my residence. The sessions were always late
                    at night and into the early morning. I sensed Rawlings was seeking to draw some
                    measure of what I was while I did the same with him.</p>
                <p>Sometimes I'd go to a location to meet him, spend four or five hours waiting
                    around with a couple of ministers, and he wouldn't show. During the wait,
                    several of his cabinet and security people would bounce in and out using
                    hand-held radios to contact him as he and entourage prowled the night. He
                    operated a lot at night and was concerned, probably correctly, about
                    counter-coups and assassination. A nighttime curfew was in force and getting
                    home could be risky for us as the police and military at the roadblocks were
                    scared and often fortified their courage with drugs and beer. Because of that,
                    on occasion he's escort us in his armed vehicle. Scared our guards, but also
                    helped us in the Ghanaian street rumor mill. If he didn't show, I'd get word
                    several days later of a rescheduled rendezvous.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>From the very first, my wife, Audrey, was specifically invited to those sessions.
                    I think it was because Rawlings didn't quite trust his own reactions and thought
                    a woman's presence would have a calming influence. He had a sense of obligation
                    towards women and could be quite charming at timealmost boyish. I felt her
                    presence helped facilitate the discussions and also kept some of the potential
                    thugs in check. After getting back to the residence, Audrey and I would use
                    separate typewriters and write up inputs, which I would combine for my cable
                    report. We would finish about dawn. Audrey's independent analyses of the meeting
                    and participants were invaluable. Hers was absolutely the kind of contribution
                    Foreign Service spouses make to the conduct of American foreign policy.</p>
                <p>By the way, the first meeting did not begin well. He arrived with a full panoply
                    of bodyguards, gun on his hip, telling of having been delayed while attending
                    the execution by firing squad of one of his former military friends who had been
                    convicted - so-to-speak - of fomenting a counter-coup. Rawlings had personally
                    recorded his last words with a hand tape recorder. In fact, he did it twice as
                    the first time he hadn't pushed the “On” button. His interest had been to get a
                    possible deathbed confession of who had previously murdered several Supreme
                    Court justices, but no success. He commented that the condemned man had made a
                    last request that Rawlings look after the man's widow and children financially.
                    Rawlings said he agreed. That's when I first noted his colleagues being nervous
                    in his presence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like this personalized Rawlings government with a
                        rulinclique would have had the country living in considerable fear.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, fear for some, but just uncertainty for most. Rawlings first coup
                    had involved considerable bloodshed in Ghanaian terms, but not much compared to
                    other African countries then and now. As I said, he had executed two of his
                    presidential military predecessors on grounds of corruption and imprisoned the
                    elected president, who had only been in office for several months. The three
                    murdered Supreme Court justices, including a woman, had been found in a forest,
                    their bodies partially burned. Several journalists were murdered or disappeared.
                    Some scores, official or personal, were settled with an occasional body in the
                    early morning streets. It was relatively mild in African terms. That all
                    preceded my tenure.</p>
                <p>When I arrived, the second Rawlings coup was over and he was well into
                    establishing the PNDC structure with borrowings from Cuban and Libyan models,
                    such as neighborhood Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR). Purges
                    were continuing, particularly members of professional groups, such as lawyers,
                    journalists and past politicians, who were arrested and imprisoned without
                    trial. Although denied by the PNDC, the anti-American, anti-imperialism media
                    line was run out of the Castle. There were still some murders in ambiguous
                    circumstances. His close associates had begun to talk about drafting some kind
                    of Basic Law. The view in the street was that he'd only be in charge a short

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds grim.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: It was, but after a time I decided the previous government, although
                    elected, had been corrupt and elitist. Some oRawlings' populist instincts were
                    compatible to degrees with American values. He believed, I think sincerely, that
                    the mass of Ghanaians had not only been exploited by their leaders, but also by
                    their own faults. He believed he was fated to restructure society more
                    equitably. He believed in forms of simplistic participatory democracy. He wanted
                    to improve the lot of the average Ghanaian and restore Ghana to its golden age
                    of immediate post-independence international image. He was embarrassed by what
                    Ghana had become. The economy was a shambles. There had been years of decreasing
                    GDP. But there had been no mass bloodletting and no inter-tribal atrocities.
                    Ghanaians have a societal sense of decorum and personal respect, which inhibited
                    the worst.</p>
                <p>After a few months, I decided it would be possible to work with Rawlings and some
                    of the people around him, who saw the prospect for economic recovery through
                    rational Western concepts. If successful, I thought in time economic progress
                    and American/Western influence could support or induce favorable political
                    adjustments, including human rights. With careful, judicious initiatives, we
                    might be able to make something of the situation.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned the economy. Ghana was pointed out at one time as being a fairly
                    self-staining country - it had solid crops like peanuts and cocoa and other
                    things of this nature - that it should be able to do fairly well. Were we
                    involved in that or concerned about their economy?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: The economy and its infrastructurroads, ports, railroad and
                    communications were a complete, utter shambles. All the worst kinds of problems
                    endemic elsewhere in Africa. In 1957, Ghana had been the first African colony to
                    become an independent country. It had been generally prosperous with a
                    reasonably well-educated middle-class. The “Black Star” had been the leader of
                    Africa and its first prime minister, Nkrumah, among other disastrous views, saw
                    himself as a pending “President of a United States of Africa”. He even built an
                    African presidential compound in Accra for the first meeting of the Organization
                    of African Unity (OAU). In 1957, Ghana and South Korea had been virtual twins in
                    economic and demographic data. Now in 1983, South Korea was an upward Asian
                    “Tiger” and Ghana had only spiraled downward.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>The cocoa producer smallholder had been squeezed almost out of existence. Bloated
                    state corporations controlled the economy. Marginal employment and over staffing
                    were six to ten times what was required. The budget was broken. There was
                    hyperinflation. The economy functioned primarily by smuggling and small traders.
                    The infrastructure had deteriorated. There was no foreign exchange for spare
                    parts or to replace equipment. Railroads to carry bulk products had stopped
                    functioning. Telephone wires had been stripped to use to tie bundles or smelted
                    down. Roads were awful. And to top it off, drought and mismanagement had caused
                    a serious food shortage. Malnourishment was rampant up-country and starvation
                    had begun. To most observers, it all looked hopeless, particularly with a
                    radical Marxist PNDC in charge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the positives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: As I noted, there were several in the PNDC who viewed the economy
                    rationally. One was Kwesi Botchwey, minister of finance and economic
                    development. He and a few others favored a disciplined approach using the
                    International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank IBRD). They recognized that
                    to have any hope of inducing those institutions and any Western consortia, they
                    had to have at least the acquiescence of the United States. That's what I came
                    to believe caused my late night meetings with Rawlings. To see if they could get
                    him to overcome his visceral distaste for dealing with the United States, which,
                    in their shoes at that time, meant me.</p>
                <p>Interestingly, I had served in Indonesia and seen first-hand how a small group of
                    American-trained Indonesian economists, the “Berkeley Mafia”, could be
                    successful economically in a situation very similar to what existed in Ghana,
                    even if Indonesia had been on a much larger scale. And there had been associated
                    political improvements, including on human rights.</p>
                <p>As for Rawlings, I felt many of his concerns were sincere and that over the
                    course of time and experience, he could be brought to welcome progress if
                    packaged appropriatelmultilateral, basic human needs, export infrastructure,
                    grass roots projects etc. I though his humanistic instincts could be directed,
                    not by me probably, but by pragmatics around him.</p>
                <p>Thus, in Ghana, I saw a chance.</p>
                <p>Q: Why was there this distaste for the United States? I wouldn't think that we'd
                    had a particularly heavy hand there. Was it coming from the London School of
                    Economics socialism? Or was it Marxism, or what?</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>FRITTS: There was a belief among much of the Ghanaian populace that the United
                    States and the CIA had been instrumental in the overthrow of Nkrumah, who was
                    the founding father of the nation. It had become part of the historic fabric,
                    even for those who believed Nkrumah had betrayed his promise and become a
                    disaster. Nkrumah's role was resurrected by the PNDC; his grave was buffed up,
                    etc. Soviet Bloc, Cuban and Libyan anti-CIA diatribes and disinformation were
                    common in the media. Philosophically, much of the PNDC brain trust adhered to
                    socialist or communist theory, including the standard analyses of former Western
                    colonialism and current “neo- colonialism.” The U.S. was depicted as the
                    capitalist-imperialist center of the world. The Reagan Administration was looked
                    upon as a cowboy renegade racist group whose concern was to overthrow non-puppet
                    governments in the developing world. All this mythology and cant was constantly
                    promulgated by the government controlled press.</p>
                <p>Q: Were there elements of the population - I'm talking about within the capital
                    city, maybe, intelligentsia that you could deal with that had a more rational
                    view?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Absolutely. For most Ghanaians, the anti-U.S. anti-Western cant just flew
                    over their heads. They had “been there, done that” before. Now they just wanted
                    a functioning economy, employment, education, money to travel, a stable currency
                    and goods in the stores. And political peace. The CDRs, for example, never
                    amounted to much. Ghanaians were masters at only pretending to participate.</p>
                <p>The general public regarded the U.S. and Americans highly. The U.S. had done much
                    for Ghana since independence, many Ghanaians had studied in the U.S., almost all
                    knew that the first Peace Corps group was sent to Ghana, and many knew or had
                    seen Americans first-hand. I often said to visitors that while we had a
                    difficult political environment, we also had, in my view, the best human
                    environment in Africa. And, frankly, there was no doubt in my mind that if the
                    PNDC collapsed in some way, some of the PNDC officials who were most
                    vociferously anti-American, would vie to be first in line for an American visa.
                    I had to bite my tongue on that more than once.</p>
                <p>I mentioned there were many Ghanaians, lawyers, professionals and politicians,
                    who'd been involved in the parliamentary system. But I felt their leaders were
                    discredited, fairly or unfairly.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>Still, I wanted to encourage potentially independent institutions. The first goal
                    was damage control, try to keep a few functioning and support a few new ones.
                    For example, I did a lot of discreet work directly with the Chief Justice of the
                    Supreme Court, which the PNDC had not abolished, but just ignored. Some times at
                    the most basic, such as providing stationery and typewriter ribbons out of our
                    own stocks. I worked with the lawyers' society in similar ways, looking toward a
                    day when they might be able to function, although some of the persons in that
                    organization were suspect in my own view concerning their personal integrity. We
                    worked at trying to maintain women's and other professional organizations, to
                    help keep them viable and quietly demonstrate some support. But we had to be
                    careful, because if support were too much or too open, it would just reinforce
                    the PNDC in-house paranoia that we were in the coup business.</p>
                <p>As part of political image, I no longer wore coat and tie, except for the most
                    formal functions even at my own embassy, as coats and ties were looked upon by
                    the PNDC as Western bourgeois affectations, even though the Ghanaian
                    Oxford-Cambridge elite had been among the best Western dressed Africans in the
                    past. Their threadbare London suits were now seldom worn, but carefully
                    retained. The PNDC and the government wore safari suits. Frankly, I also wore
                    safari suits in part because the European ambassadors didn't. When serving in
                    Africa, I always wanted to show that while many of us looked like Europeans, we
                    weren't and, indeed, had once been revolutionaries ourselves. In that and other
                    ways, I tried to indicate that I was not the representative of that great
                    mythical ogre of the United States, but was willing to have an open mind and
                    look for ways in which we could cooperate rather than ways to confront. But if
                    the PNDC confronted us, we would confront them back - as Chet Crocker had
                    directed.</p>
                <p>That reminds me that sometime in my first year the PNDC renovated the home where
                    W.E.B. Dubois had lived and worked for some years. There was an outdoor ceremony
                    for the diplomatic corps where Rawlings gave a speech of praise, which also
                    ripped the U.S. for slavery, bigotry and racial oppression. He then said he
                    would call on an ambassador to talk about W.E.B. Dubois' life. The diplomatic
                    corps froze. Of course, he tagged me, so I stood in place and winged some
                    minutes on W.E.B. Dubois and U.S. progress in civil rights. Going out later, a
                    Rawling's associate whispered, “It was a test. You passed.”</p>
                <p>Q: What about the Brits? I mean, this had been their colony at one point, and had
                    they pretty well given up with this, or were they playing a role?</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>FRITTS: The British High Commissioner wanted to be active, but London, like
                    Washington, was fed up with Ghana. Both capitals, and especially the Brits as
                    the former colonial power, felt we had devoted a lot of goodwill, effort and
                    resources to Ghana over decades, which had been squandered. Now, once again, a
                    Ghanaian government had adopted a hostile political stance citing
                    neo-imperialism, consorting with our adversaries the Soviet Union, China, Cuba
                    and Libya, and giving lip service to “wars of liberation.” London shared the
                    Washington view that it would pretty well be switched before reactivating any
                    aid programs to Ghana or put new investment resources into a country, which had
                    so ill used them and was semi-hostile politically. However, the U.K. High
                    Commissioner, Kevin Burns, felt much as I did. Probably an occupational disease,
                    if you're there, you feel you can do something. So did the Canadian and, to a
                    degree, the Australian ambassadors, until the latter's foreign ministry closed
                    the embassy. The other European embassies didn't give a hoot. Their goal was
                    commercial contracts, of which there were precious few.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about on the economic side? What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: After several months, I did a think-piece which said there was some hope
                    and set out a series of check-points for improved relations ranging across the
                    board of our interesteconomic reform, human rights, trade and investment,
                    exchanges etc. Among other initiatives in getting started, I recommended a new
                    small scale aid program, that we should induce and support the reintroduction of
                    the World Bank and the IMF into Ghana's affairs, and, importantly, begin
                    significant emergency food shipments. Ghana was in the midst of drought and
                    hunger was widespread. The U.S. got in with the firstest and the mostest. After
                    some initial difficulties, the government let us distribute our food
                    commoditiegrain and cooking oilthrough church and other private organizations
                    rather than state-owned corporations. It worked well and I was gratified by the
                    absence of government interference and the work of the private organizations.
                    Our “wastage rate” i.e. theft was the lowest AID had experienced in Africa. Not
                    too many months later, Nigeria expelled almost a million Ghanaians. Rather than
                    whine and moan for international aid, the PNDC organized basic refugee
                    processing centers and in an amazingly short period the million had been
                    absorbed into extended families. As I recall, we hadn't much to do with it. I
                    was impressed.</p>
                <p>I commented that Botchwey was already working the World Bank, knew what needed to
                    be done, and I was convinced he could convince Rawlings in pragmatic terms of
                    positive potential outcomes. The foreign minister, Obed Asamoah, was a very
                    decent experienced person totally familiar with the United States and our values
                    and policies, many of which he didn't like. But I felt we could also work with
                    him pragmatically. The U.S. should thus begin a measured series of steps to
                    indicate our willingness to work with the PNDC, while being precise in stating
                    our concerns and responding to harassments and excesses as they occurred.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>I also had in mind a broader context. If a radical socialist populist regime such
                    as the PNDC in Ghana were to embark upon a rational, Western-principled economic
                    reform and development program - and show progresit could have a demonstrable
                    impact upon other African countries, which might be, encouraged to follow. Not a
                    sure thing, but possible.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, I take some pride in that assessment. If one looks at Ghana today,
                    almost fifteen years later, it's pointed to as an example of economic resurgence
                    and vitality. Imperfect, certainly, but a measured success. And a number of
                    other African countries have similar programs, admittedly for a variety of
                    reasons. Still, I really had to fight for the approach to Ghana, particularly
                    with USAID and Treasury. But when the USG finally agreed to once more become
                    involved economically in Ghana, it had a measurable impact upon the World Bank,
                    IMF and country donors. When the World Bank president, or maybe vice president,
                    visited Ghana some months later on an inspection trip, he asked to see me. I
                    outlined the rationale that had led me to recommend a change in U.S. policy and
                    discussed the potential progress and pitfalls as I saw them. Meanwhile, Kevin
                    Burns got the HMG to get back in, arguing in part that if the U.S. were back,
                    the Brits could not be conspicuous by their absence. Within a year, there was
                    whole panoply of donor committees. Now, all of that was not my doing by a long
                    shot. Botchwey, Asamoah and others were very presentable and very effective. But
                    I did my bit and am willing to be judged on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the role of the Ghanaian military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: There was a perception that because Rawlings was a flight lieutenant,
                    that the PNDC was a military government. That wasn't true. Even though a number
                    of Ghanaian generals had been presidents, the history of the Ghanaian military
                    was not to become involved in politics. Its preferred response in case of
                    political unrest was to return to barracks, lock up the guns, and lie low until
                    the danger was over. The PNDC was a group of disgruntled noncoms and junior
                    officers who rallied around Rawlings as a flight lieutenant. Thus, the Ghanaian
                    military as an organization was not actively involved in the coups or the
                    PNDC.</p>
                <p>Instead, Rawlings had an aggressive internal security group in the Castle, headed
                    by Kojo Tsikata, a Ghanaian and former senior guerilla leader in Angola. He was
                    smart as a whip, ruthless, clever, experienced, well educated and effective.
                    Some Ghanaians considered him the real brains of the PNDC and speculated how
                    long Rawlings would last before Tsikata took over. Tsikata was, of course, tight
                    with all our adversaries of the timthe USSR, Libya, Cuba et al. He was an
                    experienced and highly competent revolutionary. A real nemesis.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>The military was primarily army. I spent a good deal of time, as I mentioned,
                    trying to support in varying discreet ways those institutions in Ghana which
                    might help provide greater diversity, both in human rights and politically. I
                    included the Ghanaian army as one of those institutions. We had had a long
                    mutually valued relationship with the Ghanaian army since Ghana's independence.
                    Historically it was apolitical and had no record of civil atrocities or
                    anti-human rights actions. It was a garrison force with the exception of
                    periodic seconding to the United Nations for service in Lebanon (UNIFIL).</p>
                <p>Its commanding general, Quainoo, and many of his officers had received training
                    at advanced military schools in the United States. I thus felt that maintaining
                    a good relationship was a visibly demonstrable means of indicating that the U.S.
                    was willing to work with those Ghanaian entities that retained some claim to
                    credibility. Frankly, and perhaps most importantly, I was also concerned,
                    particularly in the wake of what had happened to our American hostages in Iran,
                    that the integrity of our embassy and colleagues be maintained against any
                    threats from rogue elements within the Ghanaian Government and any of its
                    paralegal, paramilitary organizations. I hoped to develop a relationship with
                    the army such that if the embassy were to come under siege or attack, that the
                    army would be inclined to argue in our favor and maybe come to our assistance.
                    For the same reason, I worked very hard at cultivating good relationships with
                    the Ghanaian National Police, providing them with minor assistance in resources
                    and commodities. One might object to that on purist human rights grounds, but,
                    again, pragmatically, I wanted to develop relationships, which, if called upon
                    for our defense, might do so with some will.</p>
                <p>And the police did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: The PNDC could call out stalwarts to demonstrate upon whatever occasion
                    it wished. To a degree it wasn't all that worrisome because Ghanaians, in
                    general, liked the United States and liked Americans. The anti-American
                    diatribes sort of rolled over their heads. Many of them had friends in the
                    United States or they'd known Americans for a long time. Older Ghanaians
                    particularly remembered Americans from during World War II. They had very
                    favorable views concerning our openness and the values that Americans like to
                    pride ourselves on.</p>
                <p>But there were radical elements that could be motivated for political reasons to
                    undertake actions, and at times we had information that certain groups did have
                    those intentions. There was antipathy by ideologues to the Reagan
                    Administration, the policy to roll back the “Evil Empire,” etc. We believed that
                    adversaries such as Libya and Cuba focused on us and could be emboldened to
                    encourage actions against us. I knew the role the Libyan embassy had played in
                    the assassinations in Khartoum.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>Our renovated embassy in the former AID building on Ring Road was only about 200
                    yards from the Libyan Embassy with an open field between us. That posed security
                    problems. As part of a worldwide effort, we were able to improve our security.
                    For example, we built a perimeter wall, new gates and other devices. There were,
                    of course, the usual naysayers and criticism in the local government press.</p>
                <p>But lo and behold, it was all-worthwhile. You'll recall that the U.S. launched
                    air strikes against Libya as a response to terrorist acts against Americans in
                    Germany. Ghana became the only African country to mobilize a demonstration
                    against us, composed of regime stalwarts, civil servants, etc. We understood
                    from sources that some of its leaders had instructions to penetrate the embassy
                    and take hostages. I had oral instructions from the Department citing the “White
                    House” that I was to avoid a hostage situation by all means. I well understood
                    that the Reagan Administration, which had come into office, at least in part, in
                    response to the Iranian hostage situation, did not want one on its own
                    watch.</p>
                <p>Closer to home, of course, neither did I. We closed the embassy, implemented
                    security procedures, put the Marine Security Guard into combat gear, and a core
                    group and I hunkered down. The new wall was very effective. The Ghanaian mounted
                    police were called out and kept most demonstrators at bay. Their horses were
                    half-starved, but effective.</p>
                <p>We knew some of the demonstrators were armed, some by political organizations
                    associated with the government. A crisis moment came when a demonstrator shot a
                    Ghanaian policeman, who was trying to move them back from the gates. The
                    policeman and the demonstrator had about a two-minute confrontation and then the
                    demonstrator shot and killed the policeman from about six feet. I saw it happen.
                    The mounted Ghanaian police, observers to it all, were outraged, charged and
                    pursued the mob. I felt our investments in time, effort and personal relations
                    had paid off. We had broken windows and damage to a number of vehicles in our
                    internal courtyard.</p>
                <p>The British Embassy was further into town, so they had been hit first. Their
                    embassy was in an office building on about the third floor. Both the British
                    High Commissioner and I sent protest notes the following day, including damage
                    done and compensation demanded. It turned out that the Brit was in the midst of
                    a courtesy call from a new ambassador when a rock crashed through the window and
                    landed at their feet. With great British aplomb, the High Commissioner's formal
                    protest was a gem. His note to the Foreign Ministry began in the time-honored
                    wa“The High Commissioner of the United Kingdom has the honor ...” to do so and
                    so. It concluded, “Attached to this missive is one of the missiles.” They had
                    wrapped the note around the rock in an official red ribbon and delivered it to
                    the Foreign Ministry. I thought it a wonderful touch.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did the government respond?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: The Foreign Ministry expressed indirect apologies, but, of course, went
                    on at length to say nothing would have occurred except for our criminal act of
                    aggression against a friendly state, which resulted in the loss of life and so
                    forth. They falsely denied instigating it by a holiday for civil servants. We
                    were fortunate that, Ghanaians being Ghanaians, many of those encouraged to
                    participate didn't. I think we got some modest financial compensation for the
                    embassy windows, but not the cars. I also arranged quietly for the embassy
                    through an intermediary to pass a financial sum to the policeman's widow in
                    customary appreciation of his sacrifice. I knew the Ghanaian police would come
                    to know of it and remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said that Washington was initially “fed up” with
                        Ghana. Whawas the response to such provocations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: I tried to keep myself in balance as well as Washington. For example, I
                    initiated a quarterly “Report Card” on the bilateral relationship. I kept a list
                    of happenings - the good and the bad, the large and the small. I reiterated to
                    the Ghanaian Government time and time again that improvements in our
                    relationship and my ability to move forward on issues of mutual interest, such
                    as aid, were dependent upon deeds to implement words. At the end of a quarter
                    I'd kind of look the list over, fiddle with a sort of qualitative-quantitative
                    matrix plus trends, and assess where things stood. It wasn't scientific, but it
                    was inclusive and enabled me to stand back a bit. I think the reports also
                    enabled the Department to swallow hard a few times.</p>
                <p>I heard that these “Report Cards” on U.S.-Ghana relations became somewhat
                    renowned, at least in the African Affairs bureau and were passed around. Some
                    claimed to see them as precursors to some kind of output measure of diplomatic
                    performance, even before computers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After you decided to restore an AID program, was there any
                        impact?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Very much so. Once we made the decision to come back in, the World Bank
                    and IMF also became engaged and other Western donors followed them. They
                    followed our lead. The Ghanaians, of course, had hoped for such a sequence,
                    which had provided me with leverage. Some of the ideologues also had to swallow
                    hard. As other nations followed, we formed an aid donors group and began an
                    economic stabilization program. One of the first in sub-Saharan Africa at that
                    time.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>There were continual problems and fits and starts, but rational economic reform
                    decisions began to be made and the economy began to be reoriented. Bloated state
                    corporations began to lay off excess workers. The producer price of cocoa was
                    increased. Efforts began to rehabilitate the infrastructure in order initially
                    to promote the development of export cropthe standard things that these programs
                    help initiate. Progress helped strengthen the hand of the technocrats and began
                    to undercut the anti-U.S. and anti-West stereotypes held by Rawlings and many of
                    those around him.</p>
                <p>However, one of the continuing issues I had with the government was that it had,
                    in my view, reinterpreted non-alignment to mean that they were happy to follow a
                    Western economic development program with our resources while kicking us in the
                    political shins at opportunity, particularly in the media and at international
                    meetings, to show their good social revolutionary credentials. So I felt we
                    didn't receive sufficient public political credit.</p>
                <p>However, we did have some successes on relating even to our adversaries and
                    Ghana's friends where we carried the day. In general, if we had the facts and
                    could act behind the scenes before something became public, we had a chance to
                    forestall it. Once public, it was much tougher. However, though we paid a price
                    publicly, over the course of time the government became less radical in policy
                    even if radical rhetorically. In part it was increasing government maturitup to
                    a point. I think Asamoah succeeded in reducing gratuitous insults by Ghanaian
                    reps against the USG at the UN and other international meetings. We also became
                    aware of guidance to the police and cadres to tone it down. So a process of
                    limited moderation was underway.</p>
                <p>I recall that when the Soviets shot down a Korean Airlines airliner, that the
                    Ghanaian press launched scurrilous accusations fed by the Soviets. I organized a
                    protest by the Western part of the diplomatic corps and we had the satisfaction
                    of a grudging government disavowal and the journalist got transferred. A small
                    victory, but representative of change.</p>
                <p>I sensed that Rawlings had come to consider me a credible person rather than a
                    stereotype. He found me, I heard, something of a surprising equalitarian with
                    more policy leeway than he expected from a government he quite despised,
                    particularly how we treated his friends Castro and Qadhafi, our constructive
                    engagement policy in So. Africa, etc. Over time, his officialdom knew he
                    respected me to a point and that helped immensely. There was even a phony
                    newspaper poll which proclaimed me “ambassador of the year” and a photo of him
                    and me in smiles taken weeks before. But the USG still took a lot of heat in the
                    media and in speeches by PNDC Ministers, which kept me exercised. And much of
                    our dialogue on international issues was pretty rigid. But we got things done,
                    as is often the case in the developing world, by investing in personal
                    relations. The Ghanaians are good at that and understand it. So are
                    Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you feel that the Soviet Union was about in Ghana
                        ithose days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: The Soviet Union, of course tried to counter us and we them. For example,
                    I recall when Ghana was reportedly going to provide landing rights for Soviet
                    aircraft so they could monitor U.S. naval operations off the west coast of
                    Africa. I bypassed the Foreign Office and went right to the Castle and the
                    rights were not granted. A number of issues like that. The Soviets also competed
                    on some aid projects, usually through the Eastern Europeans. But Eastern Bloc
                    aid was either disguised commercialism or public spectacles like acrobats.</p>
                <p>North Korea liked to send trainers for massed children choreographies at the
                    soccer stadium. Ghanaian parents liked the uniforms, but didn't like all the
                    time taken away from school.</p>
                <p>The Cubans were very active in Ghana. Rawlings admired Castro, valued the
                    attention he received from him, and modeled his administration to some degree on
                    Cuba, such as the CDRs. The Cubans had easy access throughout the PNDC and
                    reinforced Rawlings and others inclinations that the U.S. was an imperialistic
                    exploiter of the Third World. Cuba was very active at that time, particularly in
                    southern Africa, and I was often perturbed. I was sure that a lot of the media
                    gunk could be sourced to Cuba.</p>
                <p>Several of the then-Bloc states had embassies, but they were ineffectual. The
                    Iranians and, of course, the Libyans were there. We were wary of each other.</p>
                <p>Q: So the Ghanaian Government responded in practical terms somewhat helpfully on
                    some issues. But as you said, our adversaries were its friends. Did you feel
                    sort of under the gun?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: We felt exposed as exemplified in the demonstration over our military
                    attack on Libya. Cuba, Libya, Iran, China and the USSR, all the usual suspects,
                    had access to the Ghanaian security structure and the overt support of the
                    government. So we were attuned to it. On the other hand, I was fairly confident,
                    particularly after the anti-U.S. demonstration that had almost gotten out of
                    hand, and occasional meetingno longer clandestine - with Rawlings, that the
                    government as a whole - and he personally - would not countenance major action
                    against us, if he knew of it. The danger was that radical elements and thugs
                    could be importuned by world or other events to take direct action consistent
                    with PNDC political rhetoric. We couldn't be lax.</p>
                <p>Q: What about American exiles - maybe they weren't exiles but American
                    expatriates who'd gone to Ghana during the halcyon days. Was there such a
                    community?</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>FRITTS: Yes, it was a poignant group. A number of African Americans had come to
                    Ghana in the first flush of African independence to welcome a new world for
                    Africa and for Africans led by Ghana and Kwame Nkrumah, now president of Ghana,
                    but also expected to be the future president of a united States of Africa
                    headquartered in Accra. They had also fled racial bias and discrimination in the
                    U.S. But their dreams were unfulfilled. The unified Africa vision died and Ghana
                    deteriorated politically and economically. Some had denounced their American
                    citizenship. Many had married Ghanaians and their children were now adult. Their
                    lives and futures as Ghanaian rather than American citizens had not worked out
                    as they wished. They were still loyal to Ghana, but wistful that their hopes and
                    dreams when young had been dashed.</p>

                <p>FRITTS: The infrastructurroads, phones, water, and electricity was extremely run
                    down. There were no functional Western hotels or restaurants. Stores and shops
                    were dark and empty, with a few canned goods from Eastern Europe. We were
                    dependent upon the local markets for seasonal foods and our small commissary for
                    basic items plus quarterly shipments of stuff from Denmark. We had brought paper
                    products and other consumables sufficient for two years. Audrey was a great
                    planner. It worked.</p>
                <p>I played tennis at a local club, which had fallen on hard times, and several
                    embassy houses had basic tennis courts. There was a rocky golf course with sand
                    “browns” rather than grass “greens.” We had a small embassy club with a pool and
                    basic amenities. A major outlet for us and other diplomats was Sunday family
                    beach parties more or less potluck. The embassy also had a lease on a beach
                    cove, which we used when security permitted and sometimes when it didn't. But
                    the undertows were fierce and dangerous. I found a spot about ten miles outside
                    of Accra where I could surf fish occasionally from a jetty, but I went as
                    incognito as I could at dusk, because it was near a main highway and my face was
                    well known.</p>
                <p>We traveled upcountry whenever we could, visiting local officials, chiefs,
                    including the Asantehene of the Ashanti who kept still impressive court and
                    American missionaries plus AID and Self Help projects. We would stay with our
                    hosts or in basic government guesthouses, as there were no local hotels we could
                    really use. Travel was difficult. We carried our own gasoline in 50-gallon drums
                    in the backseat, which always bounced, leaked and smelled from the rutted
                    roads.</p>
                <p>The defense attach� plane was very useful. It would arrive every three months or
                    so and enable us to fly to certain parts of the country and show the flag with
                    local officials. And we had incidents. Even though we'd inform the Foreign
                    Ministry of the itinerary, communications were difficult. Usually, local
                    Ghanaian officials would adapt with their usual cheer. But the ideologues could
                    be trouble.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>In one particular instance I was most incensed when we arrived to pay a call on a
                    regional governor, who was paranoid about an American military airplane, pilots
                    in uniform and a so-called American ambassador and USAID officials. Under
                    several dissembling guises, we were effectively detained under guard at
                    gunpoint. I had everyone put the best face on it for a while, but the governor
                    became increasingly insulting and unbuttoned his pistol holster in speaking to
                    me. After several hours, I was at the point of organizing a walkout past the
                    armed guards, when he received word from Accra that we were legitimate. But I
                    canceled the meetings (it was then too late anyway) and we returned to Accra
                    where I sent a protest the next day. He later became the secretary of
                    agriculture. I never called on him officially.</p>
                <p>There were a number of American missionaries in Ghana as Ghanaians are very
                    religious. As I may have said before, while we had a difficult political
                    climate, we also had what I thought was the best human climate in Africa.
                    Average Ghanaians warmly welcomed us. The political stuff went over their heads.
                    The country doesn't suffer from the degree of ethnic and tribal conflicts that
                    many other African countries do. Nkrumah was successful in welding a sense of
                    Ghanaian nationhood out of it all. Many educated Ghanaians, even some of those
                    who would speak about the United States in most difficult terms publicly, on a
                    personal level were very astute, accommodating and frequently witty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about American academics? Was there much of an
                        academiflowing back and forth, and was it of value and interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Practically none. At independence in 1957, American scholarship on Ghana
                    was widespread. In reading up before going to post, I found a vast amount of
                    scholarly work, but all outdatepolitical and sociological work from the early
                    '50s into the mid- '60s and after that nothing. Ghana went off the academic
                    scope as the economic and political climate deteriorated, the grant funds dried
                    up and the scholars left.</p>
                <p>Indeed, my successor, Steve Lyne, asked me at one point to recommend books he
                    might read to prepare for Ghana. I replied that the only good stuff had been
                    done during the Nkrumah period and was outdated. Instead, I suggested, not
                    wholly tongue-in-cheek, to be sure to re-read two books, neither one on Ghana
                    nor Africa - “The Prince” by Machiavelli and “The Annals of Rome” by Tacitus.
                    The former was insightful as to how Rawlings often operated, even had to operate
                    at times, and the latter on how the group in the Castle operated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the academic system, the
                        universitand the schools leading up to it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>FRITTS: At independence Ghana had possibly the best educational system in Africa.
                    The University of Ghana at Legon, was recognized within the British Commonwealth
                    as a prestige institution. Its degrees were accepted as equivalents with Oxford
                    or Cambridge. By my tenure, that had not been true for over a decade. Legon and
                    the other universities were frequently closed, classrooms and buildings had
                    deteriorated, furniture, phones, desks and books had been stolen and sold, and
                    electricity was problematic. Even paper and pencils were unavailable. The
                    situation was similar even in the formerly prestigious private secondary
                    schools.</p>
                <p>Professors and teachers were unpaid or received barter. Some teachers would not
                    teach in classrooms, preferring to tutor the same students outside of class for
                    cash. Many professors, Ghanaian and foreign, had gone abroad, some to Saudi
                    Arabia and the Middle East. The professional classes in general, especially
                    medical doctors, had deserted Ghana. Intellectual flight accelerated during the
                    initial year or so of the PNDC. Hospitals barely functioned. The educational
                    system was a mere shell. But Ghanaians value education highly, and many students
                    persevered.</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Indeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hadn't there been in Ghana an American aluminum plant
                        osomething?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Yes, the major American investment in Ghana was the Volta Aluminum
                    Company (VALCO) aluminum plant in the southern part of Ghana, a joint venture of
                    Kaiser Aluminum and Reynolds Metals. The dam on the Volta River was the largest
                    earthen dam in the world. It had been a major aid project by the U.S. and the
                    World Bank. Nkrumah had lobbied for it personally with Presidents Eisenhower and
                    Kennedy.</p>
                <p>The project was controversial at the outset and considered even more so as time
                    went on. In this day and age it would not have been built because of the
                    environmental impact and the relocation of massive numbers of people whose farms
                    and houses were drowned by the reservoir.</p>
                <p>The company was under great pressure from the ideological PNDC for allegedly
                    previous sweetheart deals, which were raping Ghana of its resources, underpaying
                    its taxes, falsifying import documents, using foreign rather than Ghanaian
                    bauxite, etc. While certainly exaggerated, I suspect VALCO may have done what it
                    had to do to survive corrupt Ghanaian governments. Eventually, after much
                    stress, the PNDC and Reynolds successfully renegotiated the basic agreement to a
                    balance they both could live with.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>Actually, in my time, I found VALCO quite a straightforward operation with
                    enlightened American and Ghanaian management. It was progressive in its
                    personnel policies, while operating a major industrial plant in a part of the
                    world whose infrastructure and workforce were difficult in terms of education,
                    quality and consistency.</p>
                <p>For example, it had by far the best literacy and vocational training program in
                    the country. I've mentioned that a major drought existed. The lake level had
                    fallen so far that the plant kept decreasing production and finally stopped
                    entirely, generating only a fractional amount of electricity for national usa
                    single turbine. While most of the workers were laid off, the company used its
                    duty-free privilege to import agricultural implements, fertilizers and seeds and
                    other tools not then available in Ghana so its former employees could try to
                    earn a living until such time as they could be rehired. That's not a usual
                    American corporate practice anywhere that I know of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't VALCO concerned that it would be taken over or
                        looted bundisciplined people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: It was always under PNDC pressure and media attacks for being part of a
                    neo-colonialist conspiracy. There were also labor strikes stirred up by
                    agitators or simply general worker concerns over layoffs and shutting down.
                    There were occasional concerns over worker violence and/or provocations by PNDC
                    zealots.</p>
                <p>At the embassy, we had the usual kinds of early warning arrangements with VALCO
                    with other American entities, such as up-country missionaries. But VALCO had
                    some very accomplished Ghanaians in top jobs and recognized its best protection
                    was as a Ghanaian corporate citizen, rather than an American-owned firm. The
                    government was also heavily dependent upon the foreign exchange earned from
                    aluminum and electricity exports. So as time went by, the PNDC and its
                    increasingly sophisticated negotiators became increasingly pragmatic, despite
                    PNDC-controlled media rhetoric. I generally kept out of the discourse and only
                    worked in the background when VALCO thought the embassy shoulder patch might be
                    useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So when you left Ghana in 1986, did you feel things had
                        reallmoved in the right direction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Absolutely. U.S.-Ghanaian relations had been turned around, Ghana was
                    embarked upon an increasingly effective economic recovery program, and its
                    ideological bark was worse than its bite. Then the bilateral relationship
                    collapsed dramatically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>FRITTS: A first-class spy flap. And I can talk about it because I think I'm one
                    of the very few American ambassadors ever authorized to discuss a CIA Station
                    publicly. The crisis also had major media coverage internationally.</p>
                <p>A support person in our CIA station, Sharon Scranage, was turned to spy against
                    us. Her male cohort, Michael Sousouides, was a close relative of Rawlings. A
                    foreign power aided and abetted the affair and Ghanaian internal security was in
                    up to its earScranage had left post on reassignment and received the usual
                    polygraph test at CIA Headquarters. I understand the needle went off the chart.
                    She then confessed her activity and cooperated in setting up a sting to entice
                    and meet her Ghanaian lover and handler in the U.S. He was arrested at Motel 50,
                    just down the street here on Arlington Boulevard. It was kept quiet and I knew
                    nothing about it.</p>
                <p>Several days later I was playing tennis with Ghanaians when the CIA Station Chief
                    and several visitors came and sat courtside. I assumed it was not to admire my
                    backhand. During a set break, I was informed they needed to speak with me
                    urgently. Back at the residence, I was briefed on the arrests and that the USG
                    would announce them shortly. I knew all hell would break loose. It wouldn't be a
                    routine event such as with the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: The first priority was to get our CIA people and compromised Ghanaians
                    out of Ghana. Scranage had reportedly identified many of them as well as some
                    innocents to her handlers. I couldn't take chances with lives and there was
                    already a Ghanaian FSN in prison on spy charges.</p>
                <p>I think we had about a week. We progressively evacuated all the Americans
                    associated in any way as well as those not associated if Scranage said she had
                    mentioned them. The exodus was an all-hands embassy effort. There's always
                    chit-chat about State-CIA tensions and rivalries, but in this case everyone
                    really pulled together. We had the CIA folk and their families gone quicklmaybe
                    72 hours.. They pulled their kids out of school and left their pets, household
                    effects and full refrigerators behind. Over the following weeks, State, USAID
                    and other Country Team members, including Audrey, fed the pets, packed and
                    shipped additional suitcases, took in and protected heirlooms, and helped pack
                    up effects. Real Foreign Service cohesion. We staggered the CIA departures to
                    avoid raising suspicions. I'd occasionally go and hang out at the airport on
                    some pretext in case any incident developed, but none did.</p>
                <p>We also arranged to inform many of the compromised Ghanaians, who also left the
                    country precipitately. Some real human tragedies, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What else?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>FRITTS: I had to prepare the embassy in advance of the Washingtostatement.</p>
                <p>In that regard, given potential Ghanaian government volatility, I had informed
                    only DCM John Brims and another officer of why we were doing what we were doing.
                    For the others I outlined only in general terms why the Station draw down was
                    swiftly proceeding. I held several embassy Town Meetings at which I essentially
                    said, “Trust me.” I believed strongly that if Tsikata and Ghanaian security
                    tumbled to what we were up to, they would round up Ghanaians they suspected,
                    have phony trials and execute them. There could also be incidents and attacks by
                    thugs and PNDC stalwarts against the embassy, our American officers and staff,
                    and even FSNs. Safety lay in getting our people out first and then seeking to
                    manage reactions with the Ghanaian government. If I were to be openly candid
                    within the embassy before the Washington announcement, the situation would not
                    be kept secret.</p>
                <p>By the way, when the eventual months long crisis was finally successfully over,
                    the Department sent one its psychiatrists to post to interview everyone
                    involved. At the onset and over the weeks and months, several officers and staff
                    had suffered from the continuing tension and two had been transferred. I suppose
                    today it's called post-traumatic syndrome. The psychiatrist faulted me for not
                    initially bringing everyone into my confidence as it may have increased mental
                    stress. She stated she was “sure” that if faced with a similar situation in the
                    future, I would be open and inclusive from the beginning. I said, “Absolutely
                    not.” I was sorry for the stress, but my responsibility was to save lives and I
                    would do it again if faced with what I thought was the same choice. She was
                    shocked. So be it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you inform the Government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: The top task was to forestall any intemperate reaction from the within
                    the Castle or zealot supporters by giving Rawlings a brief advance alert. That
                    meant I had to see him on short notice, which was always difficult. Only an
                    unconventional approach might do. So the next morning at dawn I camped outside
                    the home of a government cabinet member along with the usual levee of Ghanaian
                    relatives and others seeking jobs or favors. It's part of Ghanaian culture. I
                    was moved to the head of the queue, invited in and sat down at his breakfast. I
                    apologized for the intrusion and said I had to see Rawlings that very day. That
                    I had an issue of major importance to the future of U.S.-Ghana relations.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>When I saw Rawlings later that morning, I informed him of what had occurred, that
                    an announcement of the arrests of Scranage and Sousouides would be made in
                    Washington in a few hours, that unless we managed the matter wisely, there could
                    be serious repercussions, and that I expected, of course, the fullest government
                    protection for our embassy and personnel. He didn't do much batting of his eyes
                    and I don't know how much he may have known. I think he gave me the right
                    answers, but his speech was often elliptic. I then returned to the embassy to
                    finally open up with the Country Team and prepare to hunker down. That
                    afternoon, I learned that the Ghanaian security was making arrests in town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reaction after the announcement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Given the time differential between Washington and Accra, the full story
                    was emblazoned in the Ghanaian media with a heavy overlay of the U.S. and the
                    CIA attempting to overthrow Rawlings and the PNDC. We had an urgent Country Team
                    meeting, issued public statements, briefed the FSNs with the facts, sent them
                    home, and shut down the embassy to await further developments.</p>
                <p>Audrey and I were to attend a diplomatic corps activity the next day hosted by
                    the Ghanaian Army. It was to observe a shooting competition at the main military
                    base. I'd been busy most of the night and early morning, of course. And the army
                    event had already started. Once the embassy was buttoned up, should we go?</p>
                <p>We decided we weren't going to slink around. After all, it was the Ghanaians and
                    their friends who had spied on the U.S., which had no interest or intention of
                    overthrowing the PNDC. So later that morning we got into the car, drove into the
                    military base, and then across a broad field up to the stands, with the flags
                    flying on the fenders and every eye in the place upon us. Our stomachs were
                    tight. But we got out and walked in with our heads high as if it were a normal
                    day. The Ghanaian officers didn't know whether to shake hands with us or whether
                    they'd be punished if they did. I put my hand out to General Quainoo and the
                    usual Ghanaian politeness carried the day. But, of course, the adulation days of
                    “best ambassador” and easy access were over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's go to what was done. What was this all
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>FRITTS: Scranage had been at the embassy several years in a support job. She
                    appeared capable and was quite popular and good for morale. Evidently this
                    Ghanaian, who became her lover, had captivated her. He had money and gave lavish
                    Ghanaian parties with an in-crowd. She was seduced physically and morally by the
                    glamour of being selected to go where no other Western foreigner went. They also
                    worked on her gripes. She provided detailed inside information to him and thence
                    to the Ghanaian Government and what I have to call a “foreign power.” It was a
                    very extensive and serious compromise, including far beyond just Ghana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say the foreign power, is this something we can
                        -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Not really as I'm not sure if we ever stated it publicly.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, why would this cause such problems in Ghana? I mean, this was, you know,
                    our problem, not theirs. It strikes me as a self-induced tempest in a teapot on
                    the side of the Ghanaians. With the Soviets, for example, we both go through the
                    exercises and move on.</p>
                <p>FRITTS: You're correct about recurrent spy incidents with the Soviets, the then
                    East Germans and others being flash-in-the-pan routine. But in the Third World,
                    nationalism, paranoia and sensitivity are much more volatile. As I mentioned
                    earlier, most Ghanaians believe that the CIA instigated the overthrow of
                    Nkrumah. It's part of local lore and even those who had no love for Nkrumah
                    believe and resent it. The PNDC, having a radical Marxist, anti-colonialist and
                    anti-imperialist mantra, always saw a presumed CIA hand in world events.</p>
                <p>A number of its true believers and Rawlings as well, believed or were led to
                    believe, that the CIA was working with Ghanaian exiles in Togo to overthrow the
                    PNDC. I was regularly called in on the carpet or the Ghanaian media would carry
                    reports on CIA connivance from Togo. It was all delusional. As I frequently
                    said, my task with Washington was to get anyone in any agency to pay attention
                    to the U.S.-Ghana relationships, not beat back budding coup attempts. I remember
                    a cabinet secretary reading me the riot act one day. I asked him to cite one
                    single shred of evidence to support his view. His reply was classic, “The
                    absence of evidence is proof of the conspiracy!”</p>
                <p>In some conversations, Rawlings would state that I couldn't know what the CIA was
                    really doing. Once he even added, “Even me. Intelligence agencies have more in
                    common with each other than they do with their own governments”. In his world,
                    that was certainly true at least some of the time. And maybe elsewhere as well.
                    He could be quite insightful.</p>
                <p>The PNDC itself had come to power in a coup and executed two former presidents.
                    And given what many of them believed to be an Nkrumah precedent, they saw a
                    mirror image. I'm also sure the Cubans, Libyans, Soviets and others were egging
                    the issue on and reinforcing it.</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>All part and parcel of the challenges in the developing world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the fact that we had a CIA station within the
                        embasscouldn't have been a great shock to anyone.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Of course not. In fact, some persons on both sides had worked on liaison
                    matters under the previous government. The government knew we had a station, but
                    probably felt it could live with it and didn't want to jeopardize the evolving
                    overall U.S. relationship, which it needed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say the Government of Ghana, Rawlings must have
                        knowthat this was going on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Sure. After all, we knew they were watching us. I waaware of surveillance
                    at times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did this happen as you left post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: No, during my last year. Both we and the Ghanaians began trials of our
                    respective arrestees; the Ghanaians matching us step for step. Thus, the issue
                    was in the news all the time - photos of Sousouides in shackles, etc. Vignettes
                    of CIA skullduggery in Ghana. On and on. A constant hemorrhage.</p>
                <p>We eventually began prolonged negotiations for an exchange of “spies.” We would
                    hand back their man in the U.S. - Sousouides - for all our “persons of
                    interest.” There were also a number of side issues. The negotiations were
                    tortured, extended, and broke off on several occasions. At one time there was a
                    semi-official threat against me personally when the Ghanaian chief negotiator
                    said he would not guarantee my continued safety. To their credit, AF Assistant
                    Secretary Chet Crocker and DAS Jim Bishop called in the Ghanaian ambassador, who
                    was a very good man, and laced in to him. I think one of Crocker's comments to
                    the ambassador was “If a small country like Ghana wants to make an enemy of the
                    U.S., let it.” It got their attention and the chief negotiator was switched to
                    the foreign minister, Obed Asamoah. With him the process remained difficult, but
                    professional. By the way, AF DAS Jim Bishop was superb as the Washington focal
                    point. He handled the Washington end on a real-time basis and I had no
                    second-guessing from Langley or elsewhere on my game plans. Just support and
                    constructive ideas.</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>After about six months and many perils of Pauline, we reached agreement for the
                    exchange and related matters. On a particular day, they took their arrestees to
                    the border with Togo and the convicted Sousouides came across to Ghana. In order
                    to positively identify the Ghanaians, the CIA had brought along several of the
                    people we had gotten out previously. The Ghanaian press took telescopic photos
                    of the exchange, including the exiles hugging the newly exchanged. It was not a
                    good press day for the United States in Ghana. Naturally, I wasn't there, but
                    was in touch with embassy officers who kept me informed in case any glitch
                    occurred or the exchange was aborted.</p>
                <p>I thought the crisis was finally over, but it wasn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: It had been agreed that the Ghanaians and we would announce the agreement
                    and exchange at the same time, but the Justice Department violated the agreement
                    and jumped the gun by several hours. The PNDC and Rawlings were furious when
                    they heard the news on VOA and the BBC. Again, CIA and U.S. perfidy. We hunkered
                    the embassy down again and took a break for Thanksgiving. I sent a cable saying
                    that the Justice action had undone months of efforts and placed the embassy and
                    my colleagues again in jeopardy. Actually, the night before the affront I had
                    seen the Foreign Minister at a reception and we had agreed on “no more
                    surprises” and to get on with our bilateral business.</p>
                <p>Audrey and I hosted a large Ghanaian group for Thanksgiving dinner. As the
                    specially imported turkeys were being served, I was summoned to call at the
                    Foreign Ministry urgently. I delayed until dessert. Asamoah said the PNDC had
                    decided the USG had not dealt in good faith and read the names of four embassy
                    officers named persona non grata. They were to be out in forty-eight hours for
                    interfering in Ghana's internal affairs. All blameless. I remonstrated
                    conceptually and individually, but he said the PNDC decision was final. We
                    responded, of course, by expelling the same number from their embassy in
                    Washington and suspendintemporarily - our aid programs. Obviously, our new
                    “surprise” had been answered.</p>
                <p>A sidebar. After returning to the residence and finishing dessert with the
                    guests, I called a Country Team meeting where we did the necessary. I remember
                    sending the Defense Attach� to Gen. Quainoo to tell him informally that I would
                    keep the Ghanaian Army out of this. I then began a reporting cable.</p>
                <p>Alone in the embassy, the phone rang from Washington midway though the cable. In
                    those days phoning Accra wasn't easy. It was a State Operations Center watch
                    officer saying the BBC was carrying an item that American embassy officers were
                    being expelled from Ghana. What was going on? I didn't want him to be the
                    purveyor of interpretative comment, so I said I didn't know, but the ambassador
                    was preparing a cable as we spoke. “Fine”, he said.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So now what? Was it finally over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Yes and no. This was November and I was due to leave the following June.
                    During my tenure the bilateral relationship had gone from a pit to a pinnacle
                    and was now back in a pit. Neither my status nor credibility were the same. Some
                    people thought we had been interested in overthrowing a Ghanaian governmenagain.
                    It was also apparent that Rawlings no longer considered me esteemed. That
                    complicated access to the government as it meant officials felt some risk in too
                    close an association or not having it cleared by the Castle in advance. Also,
                    international economic aid programs were expanding and the PNDC didn't need me
                    or the U.S. as much.</p>
                <p>We had really been of critical importance to the Ghanaian Government at a
                    formative period. The U.S. decision to work with the PNDC, build a relationship
                    and convince others to do so through an economic stabilization program had been
                    essential. Recovery was underway. There were now established alternatives to a
                    singular role with the U.S.</p>
                <p>The government also reverted to petty harassments and vitriolic media attacks,
                    which had marked earlier days, despite pro forma statements of putting the
                    issues behind us. Meanwhile, I was determined to uphold the honor and dignity of
                    the U.S. and that meant not trying to ingratiate myself personally. As long as
                    we were pilloried, we would be correct and business like, but I was also back to
                    Report Cards. It would set the stage for my successor to be a good guy.</p>
                <p>I never saw Chairman Rawlings again personally, although I did receive a letter
                    from him some months after I had left Ghana, apologizing for not meeting with me
                    on departure. But it was an exercise by the Ghanaian ambassador in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>I've often commented that the role of an ambassador is not to be well loved or
                    liked, although that's preferable, but to pursue hopefully enlightened U.S.
                    national interests. That's our professional responsibility, not always shared to
                    my observation, by political appointees who covet abstract bilateral relations
                    and local popularity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just on that, who took your place in Ghana?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Steve Lyne, a career FSO. It was almost a year before he went out. The
                    GOG wrongly interpreted the delay as a further expression of our displeasure. In
                    reality, it was just one of those variants of the personnel process.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>Q: Sometimes something of this nature, such as problems in a country, whether or
                    not it's your fault, can be inducesort of like being the captain of a destroyer
                    as happening on your watch and thus responsible. Did you think the system was
                    saying, Well, I don't know about Fritts, there was trouble out in Ghana while he
                    was there? I mean, you didn't feel that -</p>
                <p>FRITTS: No, not at all. I received a personal commendation from the Acting
                    Secretary of State and glowing evaluations by Chet Crocker and others plus a CIA
                    award. I understand that to this day I hold some kind of record for negotiating
                    the most one-sided exchange of “spies” their one for our multiplin the history
                    of U.S. diplomacy. A few years later, I was the Department's selectee at the
                    White House to be an assistant secretary, but a political appointee was
                    chosen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that the Central Intelligence Agency
                        appreciatewhat you did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Very much so. A lot of working level attention plus an award and lunch
                    with the Acting CIA Director, Bob Gates, I think. It also created a corridor
                    reputation, which served me well in some other tasks.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, some CIA officers opined that they expected me as an FSO to be
                    less cooperative and to care more about safeguarding State's image in the
                    country. Sort of opt out with a low profile. I didn't see that as an option.
                    Whatever status I had was to be used. In this case, negotiating an exchange and
                    saving lives was not only humanitarian, but also a message that the USG, which
                    includes the CIA, will not abandon those who, for whatever reasons, have placed
                    their trust in it. Kind of a professional duty thing, I guess.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, while you were going through this, were you at a certain point getting
                    ready to get a new job? Did you know what you were going to do?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: I had expressed interest in a diplomatin-residence slot and Director
                    General George Vest was kind in his praise of my work in Ghana and gave me first
                    choice among the fifteen he had. I chose the College of William and Mary in
                    Williamsburg, Virginia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: William and Mary - you were there from, what, '86 to
                        '87?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: The '86 to '87 academic year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>FRITTS: I enjoyed it very much and, in fact, still am a faculty member. It's
                    quite a different culture, at times almost foreign. And quite different from the
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>Q: Thinking back to international affairs in '86 to '87, I can't recall any great
                    trends. It was still before the collapse of the Soviet Union. But was there a
                    different approach? Did the faculty look at things differently than you did?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, within the academic world, there are “scholars” and
                    “practitioners”. The stereotypes are akin to the Foreign Service vs. the Civil
                    Service. Those of us engaged actively in policy are practitioners. Surprising as
                    it may seem to the uninitiated, practitioners are a lower order of life, even
                    those with a Ph.D. There's also an assumption, particularly by those whose focus
                    is a single country or region, that United States foreign policy is virtually
                    always ill-founded, in large part because it isn't sufficiently accommodating to
                    the scholar's favored country or region. Part of what a diplomat-in-residence
                    does is to evidence by our lectures and dialogue that we are credible
                    intellectually and that American policies may be more sophisticated and
                    forward-looking than perceived.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find that you were giving a different aspect in classes and with the
                    faculty, sort of a workman's way of looking at foreign affairs?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: That's how faculty tend to perceive practitioneras workmen. It improves
                    to a degree if you can prove yourself. Students, particularly seniors, are quite
                    different. They have a thirst for contact with someone who's actually “been
                    there” and in the policy frays. I know many professors at the College who are
                    doing wonderful things. They're excellent, conscientious and well motivated. But
                    by the time students are seniors, they want insights from someone directly
                    engaged on the scene on the issues of the day. I should comment that students at
                    the college of William and Mary are excellent. It's one of the elite
                    institutions in the United States, even though a public-assisted university, and
                    has traditionally been a good source of FSOs.</p>
                <p>Q: What about noin this period? One of the elements that's been strong in the
                    academic world, because it's got a theory behind it which I think allows
                    academics something to chew on, has been Marxism in its various forms. How was
                    this at William and Mary?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, I think that within academic freedom there's a desire to view any
                    established discipline as legitimate. There were Marxist economists on the
                    faculty when I arrived in 1991. BuMarxist economics has now been discredited.
                    Those professors have gone on with a new name, a euphemisI've forgotten, maybe
                    “Alternate Economics” or some such. Having a professor identified as a Marxist
                    economist is no longer viable in the U.S. academic system, because the
                    discipline has ceased to exist by that name. Kind of like political
                    geography.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find yourself getting into debates or discussions along the lines of
                    saying, Well, yes, that's nice in theory, but this is what we have to deal
                    with?</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>FRITTS: Sure. The major distinction is trade-offs. All foreign policy is the
                    result of domestic and international trade-offs. And the response you often get
                    back is, well, that's “compromising with truth” and somehow unethical. The
                    issues where it comes up most often are Viet Nam, Latin America, Iran and the
                    Middle East. In virtually all cases, it's charged that our policies are blind to
                    the future. The preferred “policy choice,” for example, is that we overthrow the
                    sheiks and wait for the Middle East to shake out into freedom and democracy in
                    the long term. Well, we all know about the “long term” a la Keynes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's your current impression of how students look at
                        thforeign affairs field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: In contrast to common assumptions, I find the quality of the students -
                    at least as I see them at William and Mary - exceptional. They write well, think
                    well, and have overseas international experience far superior to my generation
                    at their age. They're more sophisticated as well as committed and begin
                    consciously to build their r�sum�s in high school. There's been an W&amp;M
                    explosion of interest in international relations as a major over the past ten
                    years. It's now leveled off. There's a good deal of interest in the Foreign
                    Service, but also a strong belief that the Foreign Service is only one of varied
                    opportunities to be engaged meaningfully in international relations. For
                    example, they're very motivated about NGONon-Governmental Organizations. They
                    engage in foreign study and exchange programs, not just once, but multiple
                    times. There's a new W&amp;M goal for every student, regardless of major, to
                    have at least one semester or summer overseas in a disciplined academic program.
                    They're just much more qualified than my generation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '87, whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: I went to the UN General Assembly to be an advisor oAfrican affairs for
                    the fall session of the General Assembly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: USUN traditionally augments its staff with former ambassadors in order to
                    lobby General Assembly delegations on UN votes. I had the Africans to do what we
                    normally do in the Foreign Service - meet them, gain access and try to induce
                    favorable stances on issues important to us. I coordinated on tactics with our
                    embassies. I helped with the briefs and attended sessions by the Secretary with
                    those Heads of State or Government I knew something about. I also worked with
                    our then Permanent Representative Vernon Walters on African matters.</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>Walters was fun to work with. I sat in on the calls and discussions he had with
                    his African counterparts. Reveling in his reputation as a polyglot, he always
                    began with a joke in French, Spanish or Portuguese. I heard each one over and
                    over and I'm sure the ambassadors had as well. But they pretended to enjoy his
                    enjoyment.</p>
                <p>He called me in one day to recount that he had a personal goal to visit every
                    country in the world, but had not yet been to Ghana. Could I arrange for him to
                    do so some months down the line when he and other senior USUN officers fanned
                    out worldwide to discuss the results of the UN Session? I thought it a good idea
                    as a means to reactivate positive U.S.-Ghanaian relations. The Ghanaian
                    Permanent Representative, Victor Gbeho, was skeptical, but he worked Accra and I
                    got African Affairs approval. The deal was almost done when Gbeho induced some
                    committee to scuttle a USUN human rights amendment on some matter. The USUN
                    officer present lashed out at the irony of an ambassador from a country led by
                    “...military junior officer petty dictator” having the temerity to upset a
                    U.S.-initiative on human rights. Accra reacted as you might expect and canceled
                    any visit. I don't know if Walters ever got to Ghana or not.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find at that time... Chester Crocker had a very
                        strong role and a different approach to the problem of South Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: “Constructive engagement.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Constructive engagement. How did you find that? During
                        this '8session, how was that going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, of course, I had worked in Ghana on trying to get Ghanaian
                    understanding of constructive engagement. They didn't like it very much nor did
                    any other African country. Some tolerated it.</p>
                <p>Personally, although I refused to travel to So. Africa under apartheid for leave
                    or recreation, I felt that constructive engagement was justifiable. The U.S. was
                    important to both sides and we should use our influence to achieve outcomes.
                    That's what America does and that's what our training is for. We've done it
                    before under other names.</p>
                <p>You'll also recall that we were opposed to the imposition of economic sanctions
                    on South Africa. Our view was that sanctions wouldn't work and would only impact
                    disproportionately on Black South Africans. Sanctions had also been shown to be
                    generally ineffective as a tool of foreign policy. I argued that case, of
                    course. In retrospect, it's quite clear, as cited by Mandela and De Klerk in
                    later years, that sanctions in the So. African context were important to the
                    change in course.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: As for any group, there was a normal curve of distribution. Some were
                    erudite, well-informed and effectivthe Ghana ambassador Gbeho among them. The
                    Botswanan was a leader. The Algerian delegation was excellent as a whole as were
                    the Zimbabweans. These Perm Reps were the equivalents of any capable ambassadors
                    anywhere. Some were only there by family or ethnic patronage or even politically
                    banished and just filling the seat. Others sought primarily to avoid any
                    initiative. So it was a usual mixed bag.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On African affairs were there issues that we were
                        particularleager to get support for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: As you will recall, every UN General Assembly session votes on over a
                    hundred issues. Many come up annually in various guises. Israel, for example.
                    And South Africa. The Middle East. Law of the Sea. Human rights. Others are new,
                    such as on the environment and the crises of the year. The Department and USUN
                    would select 15 to 20 of them as Key Issues and we worked primarily those.</p>
                <p>Q: How effective do you think we were, or was everything pretty well cut and
                    dried? I mean, in a way, people knew how they were going to vote?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: USUN publishes an annual report in detail on the Key Issues and UN
                    General Assembly voting patterns. Modifying African votes significantly wasn't
                    on. But based upon personality, ambivalence or trade-offs, occasionally we could
                    adjust some votes. But still, as I recall, the percentage of votes by the
                    African delegations in connection with the Key Issues was never much above 30
                    percent, except for Liberia.</p>

                <p>FRITTS: After that I became a team leader in the Office of the Inspector General
                    (OIG), heading teams on inspections of our posts overseas and bureaus within the
                    Department. I did that for a year and a half. I was then asked to be the deputy
                    inspector general and did that for about two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the inspector general?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>FRITTS: Sherman Funk, the first non-Foreign Service Inspector General (IG) of the
                    Department. A new Inspector General Act, establishing the institution government
                    wide, had just been implemented. The Department had fought vigorously to retain
                    its traditional structure under a career FSO. The Congress also decreed that
                    Inspector Generals should be nominated and confirmed by the Senate. They would
                    have dual responsibilities - to report to the Congress as well as to the
                    secretary of their agency.</p>
                <p>The Hill view on State was that an FSO could not be trusted to be objective and
                    there thus had to be a professional IG. Sherman had previously been Inspector
                    General (IG) of the Commerce Department and he became the first State IG under
                    the new system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, you were there at the beginning of this,
                        weren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Not quite. I was a Team Leader to start with. After it shook down a bit,
                    I succeeded Tony Quainton as deputy inspector general or, as we said, DIG.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of how this new system fitted
                        into thForeign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: The Foreign Service resisted it strongly as an outside infringement and
                    slap at its integrity. It was thus fortunate that we were well served by
                    Sherman's integrity, experience, savvy and willingness to understand the
                    differences between a domestic and international affairs agency, while still
                    being independent. He was an inveterate worker, listened well and was well
                    regarded on the Hill. He leavened occasional doses of common sense to an IG
                    staff too often focused on purist interpretations of regulations and paper
                    trails.</p>
                <p>The Department was successful in having the IG retain the existing Office of
                    Inspections, while adding new offices on Audits, Investigations and Security.
                    Inspections was primarily staffed by FSOs as in the past; the others by Civil
                    Service. The Office of Inspections had been around for about 70 years. For most
                    of that time, State was the only cabinet agency to inspect itself.</p>
                <p>Q: Actually, the Office of Inspections goes back to 1906, when they used to have
                    consuls general at large - six of them - go around and inspect..</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Thanks. The concept, of course, goes back througCharlemagne to the early
                    Chinese emperors.</p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>Q: As I recall, the inspection system traditionally had been basically traveling
                    advisors, helpful on career advice, voices of experience, that sort of thing. Of
                    course, they kept their eyes open for disreputable behavior and dishonesty, but
                    it wasn't their focus. Now it appeared much more adversarial. How did this new
                    system work?</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, you're right. It was less cozy and more adversarial. For one thing,
                    administrative inspections were now often conducted by professionally qualified
                    professional auditors, many with CPAs, plus professional security investigators.
                    State had not had that kind of high-powered technical competence before. Sherman
                    also bought into the concept that inspections should continue to emphasize
                    advice and guidance. Indeed, that our credibility in that regard would also help
                    uncover wrongdoing.</p>
                <p>First as team leader and then DIG, I worked to a consultative approach - that we
                    were really there to provide means for officers to learn how to do things better
                    than to chastise them for doing things wrong. I'm a firm believer in
                    inspections. Posts, particularly the smaller ones in the boonies with often
                    junior and inexperienced officers, benefit the most.</p>
                <p>But the process is fragile. Inspections are amazingly dependent upon the
                    willingness of officers to confide with inspectors about the post. If FSOs lose
                    respect for inspectors or come to believe the focus is to collect punitive
                    scalps, the inspection value will dry up.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, there have been articles in the Foreign Service Journal from time to
                    time saying to the effect, don't believe these guys are your pals - if they come
                    to talk to you, get a lawyer to be with you.</p>
                <p>FRITTS: That refers to the IG Office of Criminal Investigations. It was my first
                    experience with criminal investigators. They have an understandably different
                    mindset. Once an evidence trail begins, they pretty well assumand wanthe suspect
                    to be guilty. Their goal is to confirm crime and, with good reason, they are
                    suspicious by nature and training. Most FSOs have never faced arrest and tend to
                    believe that innocence is a protection. In my view, I agree they should have a
                    lawyer. Too many felt that hiring a lawyer was a testament to guiland also
                    expensive. Criminal investigators can be intimidating just by their questions. A
                    better balance was needed and I think the Foreign Service Journal focus was
                    appropriate, even if it complicated an already complex and restricted
                    investigative process.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>My main beef with our office of investigations was that cases rarely got closed
                    unless by sanction or conviction. Officers thus went on and on under an OIG
                    cloud. In part it was understandable. An officer being investigated at post X
                    might be assigned to Post Y and then to Post Z as investigators traveled the
                    world to interview persons with him at posts X and Y, now also transferred
                    elsewhere. However, even when a case was closed for “lack of evidence,” I found
                    that officers were never really cleared. As far as OIG was concerned, they were
                    still in limbo. For example, we vetted and certified that OIG had no objections
                    to officers selected for DCM, ambassador, assistant secretaries and DASs or for
                    the Senior Foreign Service (SFS). I asked to be put in charge of it. The
                    investigators took it on faith that, given a chance, FSOs would protect FSOs.
                    The investigators thus didn't like me in the chain. They would usually argue to
                    the effect that an officer currently or previously under investigation for years
                    just hadn't been caught yet. They also controlled the info in the memos they
                    wrote. I struggled recurrently to get access to basic investigative reports,
                    such as interviews, to be able to challenge interpretations. I found it a
                    tiresome slog, but reasonably successful.</p>
                <p>Although I was Sherman's deputy, the Office oInvestigations reported directly to
                    him as they also had in Tony Quainton's period. And Sherman accepted that. He
                    frequently said he'd change it, but didn't. If he were away for an extended
                    period, I was theoretically the decision-maker, but, not surprisingly, I didn't
                    get many decisions to make. However, Sherman and I talked a lot and was he very
                    good at eliciting advice. Which is partly why I as an FSO I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did we find wrongdoing or “waste, fraud and
                        mismanagement”as it's said and what did we do when found it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Most of the problems were with variants of financial fraupetty as well as
                    major. Also misuse of public resources for private purposes and poor judgment.
                    Along that line, although I didn't keep a record, it appeared to me that FSO
                    ambassadors usually got referred to the Justice Department for prosecution on
                    grounds of financial fraud. Their excuse would be to the effect that having
                    reached a point of authority, they were only redressing a bit the out-of-pocket
                    expenses the Department had forced upon them for years of their career. The
                    political ambassadors came from backgrounds of authority where internal
                    corporate controls on senior executives were scarce. Corporate resources were
                    for the use of top executivein the office, at home and on the road. Once in
                    government, they had trouble separating public from private.</p>
                <p>By the way, it was an eye-opener to me that a rather common reason we would stop
                    the nomination of potential political appointees, even for ambassadorships, was
                    failure to file income tax returns.Positively, we guided and counseled to
                    correct poor management skills and redress poor judgment. We also had authority
                    to do Inspector Evaluation Reports (IERs) to redress wrongful reports by
                    supervisors, either good or bad. I truly believe we generally left posts in
                    better shape than we found. And officers, too. We didn't just blow whistles.</p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>We also added a new and, I believe, much needed tool. Led by Ambassador Ed
                    DeJarnette, we agitated for and got authority to write IERs on politically
                    appointed ambassadors and senior officials, as well as career. It was fought,
                    but Deputy Secretary Larry Eagleburger made the decision. He wanted objective
                    feedback.</p>
                <p>It led to some interesting confrontations with Team Leaders and on up the line.
                    Political ambassadors considered themselves outside the State personnel system.
                    Now, all at once, they were going to be evaluated by “bureaucrats.” Most hadn't
                    been formally evaluated on performance by anybody for years, particularly former
                    CEOs or owners of businesses. Well-known politicians or former cabinet officers
                    serving as ambassadors felt the same way. If criticized, they went to Sherman,
                    their assistant secretary, Eagleburger and the White House. For the first time
                    in years, some were not receiving adulatory praise, but being described politely
                    but professionally as the equivalent of petty dictators, loafers and dunces.</p>
                <p>For example, a former cabinet officer now ambassador read me the riot act for two
                    hours seeking changes not only in her IER, but throughout our inspection report
                    of the post. The first sentence, not surprisingly, had caught her ey“Embassy XXX
                    is more actively engaged in promoting and defending the interests of the (host
                    country) than it is the United States.” She didn't take it kindly.</p>
                <p>The gut reactions of those criticized was to seek to have the reports squelched
                    or threaten retaliation. But Sherman gave us full backing as did Eagleburger,
                    whom I'm sure found the information useful in his White House leverage on the
                    ambassador selection process. There was no formal feedback from him, but we
                    became aware of occasional political ambassadors leaving post early or grapevine
                    telephone calls saying that an ambassador had mended or tried to mend his/her
                    ways. Same with career ambassadors, but that had always been the case. I
                    understand this authority was ended by the Clinton Administration. Too bad. But
                    without a Larry Eagleburger-type to protect it, it probably couldn't continue.
                    Too many people with clout were embarrassed.</p>
                <p>We also initiated a requirement for Team Leaders to provide informal briefing
                    memos to ambassadors and DCMs on how they were perceived at posts, their
                    management strengths and weaknesses, and suggestions on how to more effectively
                    manage their posts and handle internal festering issues. These were “Eyes Only”
                    and never entered the personnel system. OIG kept them in a very restricted file
                    and they were not used for any administrative or management purpose.</p>
                <p>Overall, I think we performed valuable services.</p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>Q: Having been involved in CA, how did you find handling accusations and
                    occurrences concerning the issuance of visas? There's always a great temptation
                    not just for fraud, but also by American officials.</p>
                <p>FRITTS: Well, as you well know, in many countries a visa to the United States is
                    a commodity of high financial value. Consuls on the line are under great
                    pressure to make quick decisions, often in only a few minutes. The system relies
                    heavily on processing by FSNs of the host country. They come under great
                    pressure to facilitate visas. Fortunes can be made quickly. Family ties are
                    strong. Rings get formed. They're hard to track and, if an American officer gets
                    involved or just overlooks it, for reasons of money, sex, empathy, fatigue or
                    malice, it's even harder. Like any crime activity, as we become more
                    sophisticated in identifying patterns and systems, the fraud rings move on to
                    new techniques. It's a constant chase. Actually, I'm surprised how relatively
                    few officers succumb. It's a testament to Foreign Service selection and
                    training. But when it goes bad, it can go on for a long time before it's
                    uncovered.</p>
                <p>And the investigative process can also backfire.</p>
                <p>For example, we had a morale issue at the Consular Section iTel Aviv. OIG had
                    become aware of a visa ring within the Consular Section. With the knowledge of
                    the consul general, hidden cameras were installed to observe and tape activities
                    by the suspected officers and FSNs. An officer and several FSNs were recorded in
                    the act. To catch the miscreants, all the consular officers and FSNS were being
                    taped. After the arrests went down, the innocenAmerican officers and FSNS
                    complained mightily that the imposition of cameras without their knowledge was a
                    violation of their professional and personal integrity. The opposing view, of
                    course, is that there's a limit as to how many people you can inform about
                    surveillance and still have it effective. Those are trade-offs. The Consul
                    General was taking a lot heat from his staff who wanted us to punish someone. As
                    I recall, we counseled.</p>
                <p>Another recurring issue involved efforts by ambassadors to get consuls to issue
                    visas for political reasons e.g. - local VIPs, children of government ministers,
                    all kinds of reasons. Ambassadors can't issue visas because under the law, only
                    a consul may do so. The law specifies that it's a felony for a consul to
                    knowingly issue a visa to an ineligible applicant. The Congress instituted that
                    law ostensibly to insulate visa issuance from political pressures. Never mind
                    that the Congress makes thousands of efforts every year to facilitate visas for
                    friends of constituents. Thus, if an ambassador forces issuance of an illegal
                    visa, it's a felony. Very hard to get political ambassadors to understand that
                    their authority is so limited.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless every ambassador, including me, thinks it important at times to
                    issue visas to persons a consul turns down. Since the whole adjudication
                    business deals in shades of gray, which I knew something about, I was usually
                    successful with dialogue. Some consuls were offended just to have any
                    conversation on the topic with their ambassador or DCM.</p>

                        opposition tthe new inspection system died down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Yes. Sherman gained credibility on the Seventh Floor and with the Foreign
                    Service over two AdministrationReagan and Bush. And he had good support within
                    the Congress. Still the Congress always poses problems, particularly
                    staffers.</p>
                <p>I became much involved when a Congressional Committee sic'ced OIG into chasing a
                    hare that several FSOS up for ambassadorial confirmation had channeled funds
                    extra-legally years before to the Nicaraguan Contras. Sherman put me in charge
                    of a team to investigate. It took months and was very arcane. After an
                    exhaustive investigation, we concluded the charge was pure partisan politics by
                    rabid staffers, who could not let go of an obsession that U.S. policy toward
                    Nicaragua had been wrong and the FSOs were pawns in their political game. When
                    we reported our conclusion that the diversion had not occurred, the staffers
                    refused to accept it and attacked us and Sherman publicly. That's the heat you
                    get in Washington.</p>

                <p>FRITTS: Thankfully, I was not. My successor, Rocky Suddarth, had just taken over
                    as deputy. Sherman was away, so Rocky got hit with it. I missed it by about

                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: I had great expectations for the Bush Administration, because I felt that
                    for the first time, maybe since John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, we were going
                    to have as President a professional experienced in foreign affairs and the
                    Federal Government. That was certainly vindicated by his success in putting
                    together the coalitions for the Gulf War and elsewhere. Unfortunately, the
                    President frequently seemed to deny his expertise on the profession. I don't
                    think he helped the Foreign Service as an institution as we anticipated. For
                    example, I know some people who were close to the president who felt that, if
                    elected, he would establish real quality criteria for political ambassadors. He
                    didn't. Opportunities were lost. I understand the patronage rationale, but the
                    losses remain. However, we did write those IERs on political appointees.</p>
                <p>I had high personal regard for President George Bush, in large part because when
                    I was going out to Ghana, he was Vice President. Normally, outgoing ambassadors
                    didn't call on him, but a friend on his staff fixed it up for a 15-minute
                    courtesy call. I wound up being there for an hour and a half while we talked
                    about African affairs. He was very informed and interested. BuI had no personal
                    or continuing relationship.</p>
                <p>I had no meaningful contact with Secretary Baker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In conclusion, are there any topics or observations you'd
                        like tmake that we haven't covered?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRITTS: Yes, several. Let me divest myself of what I think are some key
                    misperceptions in international affairs. Sometimes in my public talks, I call
                    them common wisdoms that are often wrong.</p>
                <p>The first is the role of clarity versus ambiguity. As Americans, we believe and
                    common wisdom supports the stance that achieving clear, specific and detailed
                    agreements, which leave little to chance, should be the goal of effective
                    foreign policy. It's a rational lawyerly approach and, after all, treaties are
                    the contractual law of the land.</p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>The State Department historically has taken a mildly more open approach,
                    recognizing that there can be less formal even unwritten “understandings.” That
                    approach makes people outside our profession uneasy. It makes military people
                    very uneasy. And they usually cite the supposed failure to include So. Korea in
                    Atchison's speech of U.S. security interests in Asia, which, in the view of
                    some, at least, helped precipitate the Korean War.</p>
                <p>I think the best case for occasional ambiguity is associated with the U.S.-Japan
                    Mutual Security Treat from the 1960s that was renegotiated recently. It's been
                    the successful mainstay of our forward defense posture in the Pacific for nearly
                    50 years. A major issue was how to handle the possibility of nuclear weapons,
                    given the Japanese aversion to nuclear weapons and its pacifist constitution.
                    One clause, for example, says that the U.S. will not introduce nuclear weapons
                    into Japan. What does the word “introduce” mean? We've had port calls by
                    American aircraft carriers in Japan for decades. Do those ships carry nuclear
                    weapons? Do they stop three miles outside Japanese territorial waters and
                    unloading something onto to something? We also base air squadrons in Japan. We
                    have Army tanks capable of nuclear rounds. Is the ammo in Japan? The island of
                    Okinawa is the site of numerous U.S. bases and an integral part of Japan. And so
                    on.</p>
                <p>For decades the Japanese political opposition has claimed we routinely violated
                    the nuclear proscription. There have been numerous political demonstrations over
                    the years against the treaty, U.S. bases and presumed American nukes. At times
                    the future of the Security Treaty was threatened. If nukes had been found to be
                    introduced into Japan, there would been major strategic and bilateral
                    crises.</p>
                <p>So what's the ambiguity? It is that the U.S. and Japan have a decades long tacit
                    unwritten understanding that Japan will never officially ask the question that
                    the U.S. will never officially answer. And it's worked.</p>
                <p>The second is the touching American belief that any problem can be solved,
                    including foreign affairs. Culturally, we're a nation of problem solvers. Our
                    usual professional approach is to take a problem, break it into component parts,
                    and squeeze them smaller and smaller over time so the overall problem becomes
                    less and less important and disruptive to our national interests. The process is
                    usually slow, messy and frustrating. There are backslides and redefinitions that
                    then require revised approaches. Being Americans, the American public and
                    Congress are impatient with process. They favor fast solutions, which are
                    infrequently attainable. Thus, part of the image difficulty we face as a Foreign
                    Service is that we cannot meet our national mythology with quick simple
                    solutions to difficult problems.</p>

                <p>Another hobbyhorse of mine is the widely held bromide that international
                    understanding leads to peace. In my experience it's too seldom correct. Israelis
                    and Palestinians, North Koreans and South Koreans, Hutus and Tutsis, Serbs,
                    Croats, and Bosnians to name a feall those groups understand each other quite
                    well. They share the same culture, the same or very similar languages, the same
                    foods, music, taboos, etc. Intermarriage is often extensive. In fact, they
                    understand each other so well that they'll fight and die to avoid peace.</p>
                <p>A final public misconception relates to a well-known dictum by off-quoted
                    philosopheGeorge Santayana. Winston Churchill was very fond of citinSantayana
                    and most Americans can repeat the quote back. It goes: “Those who forget history
                    are condemned to repeat it.” But there's a corollary, which I'm too humble to
                    call the Fritts Corollary, which can be phrased as “Those who remember history
                    too well repeat it on purpose.” Think of the Serbs, Croats, Bosnians,
                    Palestinians and Israelis, Tutsis and Hutus and even Greeks and Turks. With
                    malevolent political leadership, remembering history too well is a tragic
                    circle.</p>
