                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an interview with John T. Fishburn, who was one of
                        our first Labor Attach�s and was assigned to Buenos Aires in 1943 and 1944.
                        John, how did you get into the labor attach� field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FISHBURN: I went to Argentina in January of 1943 as an economist. I was working
                    on Argentine needs for finished industrial products from the United States, the
                    same problem I had worked on for two previous years in the Office of the
                    Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs from the American point of view. After
                    being in Buenos Aires for about three months my natural interest in social and
                    political and labor problems came to the fore when I found that there was no one
                    in our Embassy paying organized attention to covering and reporting on social
                    and economic problems there, especially in connection with the labor movement. I
                    asked my superiors in the local embassy if they couldn't switch me to covering
                    those fields either the labor field and the closely related ones; I found out
                    simultaneously that there had been established in the Department of State in
                    Washington under the leadership of Otis Mulliken, who was the Director of what
                    was then called ILH or the Office of International Labor, Social and Health
                    Affairs, not only a program for covering those fields outside the United States
                    but also to recruit and find persons qualified and interested to serve as Labor
                    Attach�s for the United States abroad. I knew that they were considering people
                    but had not yet selected any, so I volunteered to serve as their first Labor
                    Attach� in Buenos Aires if they approved. About two or three months later, I'm
                    not sure exactly what date, I received word that they would be glad to have me
                    serve as labor officer. They didn't use the title attach� then, for me at least,
                    and I also found almost simultaneously that Dan Horowitz had been appointed as
                    our first formally selected labor officer or labor attach�, I'm not sure which
                    title he used, in Santiago, Chile. In a way the same thing was happening over in
                    London where Sam Berger had been serving in another capacity for the US
                    Government, informally as a contact with the labor people in Great Britain and
                    so we really had Otis Mulliken heading up the work from Washington with Dan
                    Horowitz, Sam Berger and me sort of all starting more or less at the same time
                    in our various posts that I have mentioned.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>I continued in that task in Buenos Aires until the former government of Argentina
                    had been overthrown by a military junta and a new administration established to
                    replace the former government. There was, for a space of a very few months, a
                    labor minister who was very friendly and pro-United States-whose name I haven't
                    yet been able to remember-under the Government which overthrew in turn the
                    Castillo Government which had existed previously. At any rate after a few months
                    of having this friendly labor minister, Juan Domingo Peron decided that this was
                    the field that he was going to utilize. He had been so closely tied to the
                    Germans rather than the United States during the war and so unfriendly to the
                    United States, that it didn't seem likely that we would serve any useful purpose
                    at all trying to work with Peron in the labor field. As a result I asked if I
                    could be transferred across the river to Montevideo as our Labor Attach� to
                    Uruguay. That was approved in Washington and after a year and a half in
                    Argentina I transferred about the middle of 1944 to Montevideo where I served as
                    Labor Attach� for approximately a year. I then returned to the United States to
                    end that first temporary activity of mine as part of the labor function in what
                    was then the Foreign Service Auxiliary and of which I was a member during that
                    short period of the war. Almost immediately I came back into the labor field in
                    the Department of State working on Latin America under Otis Mulliken. After
                    several years during which I served as Labor Advisor to the Inter-American
                    Section of the State Department. In October 1957, I returned as a member of the
                    full Foreign Service as Labor Attach� in Rio de Janeiro for a period of six
                    years, departing on home leave in October 1963.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John, at the time you were in Buenos Aires and Montevideo
                        what was the dominant political persuasion of most of the labor
                        leaders?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FISHBURN: In Buenos Aires at that time the C.G.T. in Buenos Aires and Argentina
                    was controlled by a combination of the Communists and non-Communists many of
                    whom were socialists. The Communists did have sort of the upper hand in a formal
                    sense at the central headquarters. However, almost from the time I began
                    operating there, I found separate and anti-Communist labor groups, the most
                    notable of which was the Union of Municipal Workers in Buenos Aires under
                    Francisco Perez Leiros. Although Francisco had been a member of the central
                    C.G.T. while a Communist had been President, he was himself clearly inclined
                    toward the anti-Communist approach. I found working with him pleasant, in fact
                    Mrs. Fishburn and I spent ten days at the vacation colony of the Municipal
                    Workers Union in Sal se Puedes, Argentina, during 1944; this was a very pleasant
                    vacation, and Perez Leiros later turned out to be a stalwart supporter of the
                    AFL-CIO in the inter-American labor field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the British active in any way in the Argentine trade
                        unions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FISHBURN: As far as I know, they had no contact with them at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And was Perez Leiros a socialist or with the Argentine
                        “radicales” as they called them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FISHBURN: In my opinion and if my memory serves me correctly, he was a loyal
                    member of a socialist group and interested in collaborating with the United
                    States when the time came.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall a prominent Argentine socialist by the name
                        of Palacios?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FISHBURN: Yes, Alfredo Palacios was a leading socialist leader and closely
                    associated with the labor movement. I had forgotten about him until you
                    mentioned the name but he was there and was very active and highly
                    respected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John, can you tell us about some of your work in the
                        Department of State in the interim period between your assignment in
                        Montevideo and before you went to Rio?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FISHBURN: Jim, at the time I returned and started working in the State Department
                    I worked in that International Labor, Social and Health Affairs Division under
                    Otis Mulliken. Otis, as Director of ILH, had been recruiting additional labor
                    attach�s, at least half a dozen some of which such as Dick Eldridge had been put
                    in position. These included Dave Burgess Dick in Paris, and Dan Horowitz, who
                    was still active but didn't stay in Chile very long as I remember. Most of the
                    earliest labor attach�s were men of academic background who had been interested
                    in labor and social problems and recruited by Otis Mulliken. However, Otis ran
                    afoul of his superiors. I think he was unwisely and unfairly relieved of his
                    position somewhere around 1946 or 1947. I'm sorry to say that as far as I know
                    since his replacement the State Department has not had an adequate or effective
                    labor section working in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John, would you care to comment on McCarthyism or the
                        influence of Senator McCarthy in the State Department at that period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>FISHBURN: You couldn't ask that question of a better person. I was one of the
                    last three men listed among the 57 that McCarthy first printed in the
                    Congressional Record. Along with two others, I was listed only by name-with no
                    details. As a result of that action I stated publicly that there was nothing in
                    my past that I knew of that entitled him to make such a charge and I would
                    welcome any questions anyone would like to ask. Members of the press did come
                    and I told them and answered all their questions as well as I could. Naturally
                    within the Department, in the Administrative Section, there had to be some
                    formal recognition of McCarthy's charge and so I was given a questionnaire to
                    fill out and then asked to appear before a committee where I was interrogated. I
                    replied as best I could but I later found out that there had been some confusion
                    between me and another individual of similar name at the University of
                    Oklahoma-later than my time there. At any rate I do know that some people within
                    the Foreign Service, especially those who dealt with the Far East, were
                    seriously harmed in their career. As far as I was concerned my superiors in the
                    State Department and all that I knew were solidly behind me as a non-Communist
                    and a reliable, open person. I can't say to this day that I or my career were
                    harmed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thank you very much, John. Now, regarding the AFL and then
                        the AFL-CIO after the merger, when did they really become active in the
                        Labor Attach� program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FISHBURN: Who is they?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They, John, would be the AFL and the AFL-CIO, such people
                        as Serafino Romualdi and Irving Brown.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FISHBURN: The AFL through Serafino and Bill Doherty were active from at least
                    1945 to my personal knowledge and I think they may go back a year or two before
                    that. The CIO really didn't become active in international labor affairs until
                    they became almost a separate CIO organization and separate from the AFL. And
                    then at that time they did have some representatives who were active in Latin
                    America also with which I was still concerned and responsible in ILH run by Otis
                    Mulliken or later Tom Holland after he replaced Otis. The CIO never did develop
                    nearly as effective a representation in Latin American as Serafino Romualdi.
                    Serafino was by all odds in my opinion the most effective leader against
                    Lombardo Toledano, head of the Communist-lead Latin American Confederation of
                    Workers. Serafino came in and really developed effective relations with such
                    Latin American labor leaders as Perez Leiros and others elsewhere, who helped
                    Serafino to undermine the C.T.A.L. which was led by Lombardo Toledano, the
                    pro-Russians and Communist labor leaders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John, did the AFL-CIO or the AFL have a prominent role in
                        the selection and recruiting of Labor Attach�s?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>FISHBURN: Well, in the early years I don't think either the AFL or the CIO had a
                    prominent role in their selection. Some limited cooperation with the AFL and
                    later the CIO was first developed perhaps by Serafino and me. Slowly our labor
                    movement began to have greater influence in the selection of Labor Attach�s
                    whose background was in the American labor movement-as distinct from the
                    academic origins or just personal interest approach to life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall when the American Institute for Free Labor
                        Development or AIFLD was set up and were you consulted about this
                        organization or the foundation of such an organization at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FISHBURN: Yes, that was set up while I was serving a Labor Attach� in Rio de
                    Janeiro and it was established somewhere around 1960 or 1961. I heard about it
                    through a group with which Serafino had been working in Sao Paulo and Jim Shea,
                    my assistant, helped me follow it. Serafino came down and collaborated both with
                    Jim and me with the labor group which later became the Brazilian segment or
                    section of the AIFLD. Later the AIFLD was headed up by Bill Doherty rather than
                    Serafino and with that change there was a rather drastic alteration in the
                    technique of operation in Latin America by the AFL.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John, could you tell us about your experience in Brazil
                        and then back in the Department and then when you went on to Geneva?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>FISHBURN: Jim, we spent six years in Rio. They were some of the most pleasant and
                    productive years that I felt we served in the Foreign Service simply because it
                    left us there long enough to really get to know the country and its people. As
                    we left Brazil I felt that my last year there was by far my most productive one,
                    but rarely does a Foreign Service Officer get to serve six years in one country
                    and even in a big one. It is a distinct disadvantage if you have to change
                    frequently, every two to three years or so-but at any rate it was pleasant for
                    us and I hope useful. The ability to collaborate with various individual
                    components of the Brazilian labor movement was aided enormously by our ability
                    to have sent to the United States a certain number of Brazilian labor leaders
                    for training up here, by me and our Assistant Labor Attach� in Sao Paulo, with
                    both of us able to handle the language fluently in the labor field. When I
                    returned to Washington after my assignment in Rio for six years, it was in
                    different capacities for a while including the selection of young American labor
                    officers for the Foreign Service as a whole and then finally working two years
                    under Phil Delaney as an Advisor to the Secretary of State in the international
                    labor field. By that time the AIFLD was in full swing of operations in the Latin
                    American labor field and collaborating with the US Government and various
                    segments of it as anywhere else. Later I was offered the opportunity of going to
                    Geneva as Labor Attach� as our liaison with the I.L.O. or International Labor
                    Organization. In that capacity, I served for three years, my final stint in the
                    labor field for Uncle Sam; I must say it was a fascinating one at a period when
                    we found that the I.L.O. which originally been established by President Woodrow
                    Wilson, Lloyd George in Britain and Clemenceau in France to serve as its
                    principal purpose the development of non-Communist labor groups throughout the
                    world to support democracy and our Western governments. We found that at that
                    final period of mine the most influential single group, I'm sorry to say, in the
                    I.L.O. was the Russian group and its friends throughout the world. They had
                    managed to subvert labor groups in various countries and it was a discouraging
                    historical change and one which I'll have to say I don't think our government
                    faced very clearly. The facing of international problems of this sort within the
                    specialized agencies of the United Nations is something for which the
                    organization within the State Department in Washington, at least as of the time
                    of my retirement in 1970, was not prepared to do.</p>
