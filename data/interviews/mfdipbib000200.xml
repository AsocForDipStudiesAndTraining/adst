                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Vincent V. Checchi is an economist who served with the War
                        Production Board, military government, United Nations Relief &amp;
                        Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), edited a magazine, worked with the
                        Marshall Plan, and almost forty years ago founded Checchi and Company, which
                        is an organization that has worked all over the world. Mr. Checchi is
                        present Chairman of that company, still very active.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Vince, it is a pleasure to have this interview with you. I'd like you to tell us
                    how you got into all this. Give us some background.</p>
                <p>CHECCHI: My first service abroad was in Allied Military Government in Italy. From
                    there I transferred to UNRRA when UNRRA started its operation there. I worked
                    for Harlan Cleveland, who will show up in your history elsewhere. Harlan was the
                    number-two man in UNRRA, responsible for the economic side, as distinguished
                    from the refugee side. Subsequently, he went to China and I followed him
                    there.</p>
                <p>After UNRRA, I went to the World Bank, but the Bank at that time, which to my
                    recollection must have been around 1947 or '48, was inactive. The main activity
                    in international programs by that time had been concentrated in ECA (Economic
                    Cooperation Administration). So I called Harlan, who was now there, and asked
                    him if there was something I could do in ECA that was more fun than working in
                    the World Bank. The Bank at that time was a 9:00 to 5:00 or 9:30 to 5:30
                    institution, where ECA was sort of a 7:30 to 11:30 (PM) institution. If you were
                    lucky, you got a little time off on Saturdays and perhaps even Sundays.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sunday afternoons. (Laughter)</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>CHECCHI: Exactly, Harlan was running, within ECA, what I recall was called the
                    China Program. At that time, Chiang Kai-shek was in the process of being
                    expelled from the mainland, but hadn't quite, so there was still a program going
                    on of relief goods to him. Harlan was responsible for that. The late Frank
                    Turner had a role in it. I had a role in it. Harry Price, who subsequently wrote
                    a history of the Marshall Plan, also was in that office. It was kind of a
                    salvage operation. Nobody foresaw, on our side of the building, what was going
                    to happen later. It was simply a case of getting relief goods to the
                    Nationalists. Everybody could see they were losing. Every day word would come in
                    that another city had fallen.</p>
                <p>So it was apparent that there was no immediate future in the China Program for
                    its staff and that it would soon end, although I think ECA and its successor
                    agencies did keep a program going in Taiwan for many years after that. But by
                    then both Harlan and I were out of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't there something set up in China or Taiwan later
                        called the Joint Commission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHECCHI: Yes, something called the Joint Commission for Rural Reconstruction
                    (JCRR). A very good man named Ray Moyer was the primary mover in that. I don't
                    know if he's still living or not. He was already middle aged by then.</p>
                <p>I ended up, thanks to a recommendation by a friend of mine, Jack Corbett, who
                    later worked in Checchi and Company for a number of years, as head of the
                    East-West Trade Branch, I think they called it. This was not a Branch for
                    stimulating trade between East and West. It was a Branch for regulating trade
                    between East and West in strategic commodities.</p>
                <p>My recollection of how this Branch got started was that, at a hearing concerning
                    ECA and the Marshall Plan, one of the congressmen or senators asked Paul
                    Hoffman, “How are you going to see to it that strategic goods don't move from
                    Western Europe to Eastern Europe?” In reflection, I think he could have said,
                    “Well, that's not my business. That should be the State Department's business or
                    the business of the Department of Commerce.” He said that ECA would be
                    responsible.</p>
                <p>Therefore, the Branch was set up under the late Arthur Smithies and,
                    subsequently, Jim McCullough. The East-West Trade Branch, which was one of
                    several branches that reported to Arthur and, subsequently, to Jim, was very
                    much a nitty-gritty “how do you keep a certain type of jackhammer from being
                    exported,” job. It was about as difficult a job as you could imagine, because
                    all the European countries had foreign exchange and balance of payments
                    problems. They all wanted to export. Their views of what could be useful to the
                    Soviet economy and the Eastern European economy didn't correspond with ours.
                    Italy had one view, England had another, France had still another. We in the
                    Branch were handed a list of critical commodities categorized as to
                    importance.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. Categorized.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHECCHI: Yes. Some were more important than others. There were regular meetings
                    in the Department of Commerce, where the military, the CIA, the Department of
                    Commerce, and ECA would sit down and discuss how to get those governments that
                    were in the Marshall Plan to coordinate their trade policies with ours, with
                    respect to these critical commodities. Even countries that were not receiving
                    ECA assistance were supposed to be persuaded to follow our trade policies. That
                    included, for example, Switzerland. I made several trips to Vienna, Berne,
                    Stockholm, Paris, and so forth, trying to get something done along these lines
                    which, in retrospect, was very difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. Did you coordinate this with the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHECCHI: Very much so. Ed (Edwin M.) Martin was the man on the committee that
                    represented State. I had a small but brilliant staff. One man was Arthur Cox,
                    who since has had quite a career writing on Soviet relations. Another was a
                    brilliant young economist from Berkeley, Chris Calsoyas. I always had the
                    impression that Chris was so brilliant that he found his work boring, so he
                    eventually went back to college and got a degree in physics. I wouldn't be
                    surprised if he isn't devising a bomb or a new computer somewhere.</p>
                <p>Another member of the staff was a person who went on to the Foreign Service,
                    Louis Boochever. You may perhaps remember him. He returned from the Foreign
                    Service some time ago, and I think took a job on the Hill. Another person was
                    Robert Marshall. I've lost touch with Bob. He was a William &amp; Mary graduate,
                    and I think stayed on in ECA.</p>
                <p>I don't recall how long I was in that job, but I lured myself out of it. I had a
                    mistaken idea that I was a writer, and I had submitted a few pieces to magazines
                    and they had been accepted. A friend of mine had started a new magazine called
                    the Reporter, so I asked him for a job and he gave me one at considerably more
                    than I was worth, as it turned out, and considerably more than I was paid by
                    ECA. I went to New York and tried my wings as an editor, and found that there
                    may be worse editors in the world than I, but if so, I have never come across
                    them. So after six months or so, by mutual consent, I left the job. I think the
                    magazine prospered after I left.</p>
                <p>That left me without a job, so I called Harlan Cleveland, who always seemed to be
                    good at finding jobs for me, to ask if he had anything I could do. He said that
                    ECA was about to send somebody to the Philippines, and would I be interested in
                    a short-term assignment. I jumped at the chance. I'd never been to the
                    Philippines.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>That job had different roots. ECA was not active in the Philippines. The
                    Philippines had their own war damage program. I think it dated back to a speech
                    that Roosevelt had made, in which he had promised the Philippine people that
                    every Nipa hut, every caribou lost in the war would be replaced, asking the
                    Filipinos to stand by us, promising them that we would be back, and that we
                    would repair the damage of the war. So when the war ended, a war damage program
                    was launched in the Philippines. This was independent of ECA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know who administered it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHECCHI: Yes. It was administered by the State Department, but it was a kind of
                    loose arrangement, because the Army hadn't left yet. When it did, the State
                    Department took over. They launched a commission called the War Damage
                    Commission, which was composed of two Americans and a Filipino. The Americans
                    were Frank Waring and John O'Donnell. John O'Donnell was a political type. I had
                    the impression he was active in Democratic Truman-type politics. Frank Waring,
                    the Chairman, was a distinguished civil servant who had had a lot of experience
                    in the federal government. The name of the Filipino escapes me. But the
                    Commission, as I understand it, was dominated by the two Americans, and
                    particularly by Waring.</p>
                <p>Here again my memory may be at fault, but I think they had at their disposal $400
                    million. The concept was not reconstruction and development in the ECA terms;
                    this was a case of, as I understand it, “Prove to me that your house really was
                    bombarded, and we will give you a payment.” It did not deal with what shape the
                    country should take; it was a case of reimbursement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. That's interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHECCHI: As I recall and as I understand, there was friction between the
                    ambassador and the chairman of the War Damage Commission, Waring. They didn't
                    like each other. This is in the realm of gossip.</p>
                <p>To go back to how I happened to go to the Philippines. By way of background, the
                    Philippines had emerged from the war in really dreadful shape. The $400 million
                    did not at all cover the amount of damage that had been done. The economy in the
                    working sense had been fractured. A lot of people had been killed. Commercial
                    relationships had been destroyed. There were a lot of carpetbaggers around.
                    Corruption was rife, not as bad as later on under (Ferdinand) Marcos, but bad
                    enough. The balance of payments was adverse. The country was running out of
                    foreign exchange.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>So the Philippine Government, which, in those days, had still a kind of little
                    brother attitude toward the US Government, asked the US for assistance. Truman—I
                    think it was with the advice of (Dean) Acheson—sent a study mission to the
                    Philippines called the Bell Mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Daniel Bell.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHECCHI: Yes. Daniel Bell was the president of the American Security &amp; Trust
                    Company here in town, but before then he had been the director of the budget. He
                    was a man whom Truman trusted, a man of the utmost integrity, soft spoken,
                    quiet, thoughtful. He headed up this mission to go and see what should be done
                    about the Philippines, because clearly the $400 million hadn't done the
                    trick.</p>
                <p>It's not clear to me just how the mission was chosen. I think Dan may have chosen
                    one or two persons, but I have the feeling that the different agencies, such as
                    ECA, each jumped to put somebody on the mission. For example, there were two men
                    there from the Department of Agriculture, there were two men there from the
                    Department of Commerce, a couple of men from the State Department, and Eddie
                    Berstein, who was Director of Research of the International Monetary Fund, but
                    before then had been an economist at the Treasury Department. I think he was a
                    person whom Dan knew. I think perhaps he was somebody whom Dan asked to go
                    along. A Washington lawyer, Joseph Friedman, who had been at Treasury and who
                    knew the Philippines, was also on the mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anyone along, as far as you would know, from the
                        Technical Cooperation Administration named Point Four?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHECCHI: I don't think so. I'm a little confused time-wise whether Point Four had
                    been promulgated yet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was promulgated in the second term of Truman, so it
                        could have been later—I mean the ECA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHECCHI: Yes. At any rate, this mission was not started as part of ECA. It was a
                    presidential type of thing. Truman, if I can reconstruct, had said, “You know,
                    Dan, I've got to send somebody to the Philippines. Will you do it for me?” And
                    then Dan put together this scratch team. I don't think Dan envisioned having
                    somebody from ECA. I think what happened was that the various agencies didn't
                    want to be left out so ECA sent me over as its representative.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>I didn't go over with the team; I arrived about a week or two later. They were
                    somewhat surprised to see me. I really didn't have a job to do because I was not
                    a technician in any of the specific fields, such as ports or agriculture. But
                    Dan, being the gentleman that he was, immediately put me to work anyhow. I
                    worked mainly with Eddie Bernstein but also with the other members of the
                    team.</p>
                <p>Dan's approach was to gather the team together every day to sit around the table
                    and discuss the various issues. I was the exponent then, as I am now, that any
                    aid should be on a quid pro quo basis. That is, “You do this and we'll do this”
                    basis. Not all members of the group felt this way. A report was eventually
                    written. The summary and recommendations were written by Eddie Bernstein. I had
                    a considerable role shortening and rewriting his stuff and arguing with him
                    about what should be said. It was, of course, finally Dan's report in the sense
                    that, while he rarely put pencil to paper, he didn't let anything go into the
                    report that he didn't want in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had chaired all of the meetings.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHECCHI: He chaired all of the meetings, and he listened. He was a good listener,
                    and he had that indefinable quality which one calls good sense and good
                    judgment.The recommendations called for launching a program of $250 million
                    contingent on the recommendations of the team being accepted. The
                    recommendations were very long; there were all kinds of them—for example,
                    recommendations as to taxes, minimum wages, and conduct of the central bank. The
                    report was put in Truman's hands. I understand that Truman wanted Dan to go back
                    to put this program in force. Dan couldn't, and the program drifted to ECA
                    because there really was no one else to carry it out. ECA, in turn, sent Bill
                    Foster to the Philippines, accompanied by Allen Griffin. Before they went, in a
                    series of meetings here, all of which I think I attended, between the State
                    Department and ECA, it was decided that Foster could offer aid on the order of
                    magnitude of $250 million in loans and grants, contingent on progress toward
                    implementation of the Bell Mission recommendations.</p>
                <p>Foster asked me to go along as a sort of spear-carrier for himself and Griffin,
                    and we met with the appropriate people in the Philippine Government, including
                    the President, the Governor of the Central Bank, and principal members of the
                    Cabinet. In the discussions of what were the more important Bell
                    recommendations, there emerged—I think it was largely due to Bernstein's views
                    and to mine—that the prime objective should be to balance the budget (sounds
                    familiar, doesn't it). The thrust was, “You balance your budget and we'll help
                    you.” I remember Livingston Merchant saying to Foster something to the effect:
                    “We can't expect perfection, but they must tax and get their fiscal house in
                    order.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Merchant at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>CHECCHI: He was Assistant Secretary for the Far East in the State Department.So
                    Foster took me along, I think because I was the only person around available to
                    him who had any knowledge of the Philippines; nobody else in ECA had any.
                    Griffin had been in charge of the China Program. Foster had sent him to China
                    with Roger Lapham, formerly mayor of San Francisco and president of the
                    Hawaiian-American steamship lines, to trouble-shoot the liquidation there of the
                    program and its subsequent transfer to Taiwan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lapham later became mission director to Greece.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHECCHI: Yes. Big man in San Francisco.</p>
                <p>We landed in Manila and were immediately met by all the big shots—the way that
                    the Filipinos can do, with parties and dinners and all. At a brainstorming
                    session with Griffin and me, Foster said, “You know, we can't ask them to do 79
                    different things. Let's pick out the two or three that we want them to do first,
                    and then we'll go on to the others.” I remember that at that meeting I said,
                    “We're going to stick them with an awful lot of taxes. We really should show
                    that, in addition, we're doing something for the poor man. So how about a
                    minimum wage law?” That was one of the Bell recommendations.</p>
                <p>In the Philippines, as in most countries, including our own, enforcement of
                    minimum wage laws is difficult and not perfect. But there are certain types of
                    industries in the Philippines where you can enforce such a law. So it was agreed
                    that this is what we would require. An appropriate agreement was then signed. In
                    the Philippines, it's called the Quirino-Foster Agreement. In the United States,
                    it's called the Foster-Quirino Agreement; Quirino being the President of the
                    Philippines.</p>
                <p>The agreement was short. It said specifically that the Philippine Government
                    would raise taxes (in effect, balance their budget) and adopt a minimum wage
                    law. In general, it said the government would support the other recommendations
                    of the Bell Mission.</p>
                <p>After the agreement was signed, Foster decided to leave me there to be the
                    watchdog and help nurse through the necessary legislation. In effect, I was a
                    mission chief with a staff of zero. I set up an office in the Manila Hotel,
                    which was extremely efficient. Subsequently, the staff grew.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you just stayed there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHECCHI: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't come back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHECCHI: I did not come back. My wife and children joined me there eventually.
                    The staff grew slowly. Washington sent me a tax expert, Dr. J.K. Hall, and a
                    labor expert, Dr. Harry Kanter. Subsequently, Dr. Hall had to leave and he was
                    replaced by Dr. Roy Jastrom. All these men were very good. Two other very good
                    men were Denny Scott, a lawyer, and Clarence Eskildsen, an agricultural
                    expert.</p>
                <p>So I kept a watching brief on the Philippine Government. Elpidio Quirino was
                    president and I met with him from time to time. He appointed his closest
                    political ally, a man named Jose Yulo, as liaison. Yulo later on ran for vice
                    president under Quirino. If Quirino had won, Yulo would eventually have become
                    president as in those days they had a limitation on how long anyone could serve.
                    Marcos ignored that after he took over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHECCHI: The trick was to get the Philippine Congress to approve some very stiff
                    taxes, which eventually they did. They also approved the minimum wage law. They
                    gave a general endorsement to the recommendations of the Bell Mission, and the
                    aid started to flow. In those early days, because nobody else had much knowledge
                    of the Philippines in AID/Washington, I was pretty much left on my own.</p>
                <p>Eventually, for personal reasons, I decided to come home. I was succeeded by a
                    fine man named Roland Renne, who had run for governor of Montana, I think, and
                    had lost. He had previously been president of the University of Montana.
                    Subsequently, Washington assimilated the Philippines Mission into the
                    ECA/MSA/AID set up. But, in the beginning, it was different. For a while, we
                    were not subject to the same machinery as was, say, Italy or Paris. The big
                    names, people like Averell Harriman, really never became involved. Foster had
                    succeeded Hoffman as the head of ECA.</p>
                <p>At any rate, I came back and shortly thereafter resigned from the agency. Griffin
                    wrote me a terrific letter, thanking me and all that kind of stuff. That was
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had other people on your staff eventually.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHECCHI: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were their jobs? Did they give recommendations or
                        technical assistance to anybody in the Philippine Government?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>CHECCHI: Yes, but it was a lean staff. I forget how many people there were. They
                    dribbled in one or two at a time. Doris Bebb, an administrative assistant, and
                    Terry Pedigo, my secretary, were terrific. Some came in from the South Korea
                    Mission which was closed.</p>
                <p>The ready acceptance by the Filipinos of Americans and their respect for American
                    training and American schooling, meant that every person that came over that had
                    ability was inserted into a job and was effective almost from day one. For
                    example, Eskildsen worked with a Filipino named Amando Dalisay. He was a Harvard
                    Ph.D. and a patriot. The two of them worked hard and late, based on mutual
                    respect for one another's skills.</p>
                <p>There wasn't time for a bureaucracy to grow. The labor man Washington sent over
                    was from our Department of Labor. He had been working on minimum wage
                    legislation and minimum wage problems for a long time. When he talked about how
                    it was in the States, his opposite number or numbers would listen and there was
                    no problem. The tax man from the University of Washington, James K. Hall, that
                    Washington sent me was careful and smooth and well educated. He got along well
                    with the Minister of Finance. Yes, we provided technical assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At a very high level.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHECCHI: Yes. We gave it in connection with a program to which their Congress and
                    their president had specifically agreed. It wasn't a case of sending over, let's
                    say, four guys that knew all about coconut culture and were working in the
                    field. All of our work was done in Manila. Later, I think, the modus operandi
                    changed. When I was there, I could see the president whenever I wanted to,
                    although I didn't abuse the privilege. Yulo, who I believe was the second most
                    powerful man in the country, would come to my office frequently or he'd ask me
                    to come to his office. He would explain the situation in Congress, why a certain
                    element of the legislation was delayed. Then he would say, “Don't worry. My boys
                    will handle it.” What he meant by “his boys” were guys in Congress who were part
                    of his group.</p>
                <p>It was technical assistance but it was not technical assistance in the sense that
                    it exists today in the Philippines or in most countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were advisors, consultants, really, at a very high
                        level.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHECCHI: Correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Based on previously agreed-to programs and policies.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>CHECCHI: Yes. Wanted and respected. With respect the Ambassador, the idea of
                    playing one American against another was not unknown to Filipinos. The Filipinos
                    are very intelligent people. When a man works his way through Philippine
                    politics and gets to be president or in high office, he's as smart and clever as
                    anybody you're going to meet. So there was no doubt that at least some Filipinos
                    would have liked to have had the Ambassador and me fighting with each other. We
                    knew this so we made it a point never to show anything except a united
                    front.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know whether he had come out of the career Foreign
                        Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHECCHI: He was a lawyer. I believe—I could be wrong—that he was associated with
                    the law firm of Louis Johnson, a strong Democrat. Some ten years or so
                    afterward, he called me up as he had a project he wanted to do, and we talked
                    about doing it. It didn't pan out. We in no sense were unwilling to work
                    together then or later.</p>
                <p>Today, AID is so small in the total picture that I don't think there is much
                    prospect of friction between the AID Administrator and the Ambassador. But back
                    in the days we are talking about, the ECA Administrator was a man very often of
                    greater prestige than the Ambassador and, if he had nothing else, he had money
                    to spend. David Zellerbach in Italy, for example, probably swung more weight
                    than Alexander Kirk, who was a career Foreign Service Officer. David Bruce and
                    Barry Bingham were other Mission Chiefs. No Foreign Service Officer was going to
                    outweigh those fellows.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. Also, by law—and I'm sure it applied to you, whether
                        you used it or not—you ranked second to the Ambassador in the country. You
                        outranked every other American there other than the ambassador
                        diplomatically.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHECCHI: Yes. So naturally there was occasionally a little tension but nothing we
                    couldn't live with. When the Ambassador was away, we dealt with his DCM, Vinton
                    Chapin, a particularly good man. When Chapin was there, there was no tension at
                    all. I'd make a report to him out of courtesy, and he'd say, “Thank you very
                    much,” and I think he'd almost be looking at his watch to see—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you'd be through.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHECCHI: When I'd be through, so he could go on with his work.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your relations with the home office? Did you
                        get backstopping from the home office here in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHECCHI: The backstopping for a while was superlative. At that time it was
                    handled by a fellow named Charles Wolf, who is now the Director for Research for
                    the Rand Corporation. He was very junior, and I think pretty soon people began
                    to—I'm only guessing—get into his act. There was a fellow named Eugene Clay that
                    did this and a man named Edwin Arnold.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember Eugene Clay. Related to General Clay, by the

                </p>
                <p>CHECCHI: Exactly. He had served in the Philippines and I think he felt that made
                    him an expert. He was not well liked over there by the embassy staff nor by the
                    Filipinos. I don't think Wolf, being quite junior, could withstand him or
                    Arnold.</p>
                <p>Griffin, at some point, appointed as desk man a fellow who was out of a trading
                    company in San Francisco, who had also had some experience in the Philippines,
                    but he'd been a salesman. His name was Allen. A very likeable fellow, but knew
                    nothing about government.</p>

                <p>CHECCHI: Yes. But at a high level. Wolf, Clay, and Allen were the guys who
                    handled the cable traffic. Anyhow, the backstopping was mixed. But, as I say,
                    Wolf was terrific.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What years were you in the Philippines? Do you
                        recall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHECCHI: I don't recall exactly. I think it was '49, perhaps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To '50?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>CHECCHI: Something like that. It was during the Truman second term. In a
                    management sense, what's to be learned? I don't think anything in particular.
                    The same thing you always learn, which is put good people in the job, spell out
                    clearly what you expect from them, and see that they do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you learn things from this that you then applied when
                        you set up Checchi and Company and the way you went about your business and
                        the kinds of things you did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHECCHI: Sure. Always. That's a constant process, you know—how you pick the good
                    people and how you set the objectives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: People is the important thing, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHECCHI: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've interviewed Ed Martin both for his role as ambassador
                        and otherwise, and he said that people was the very important thing in all
                        the things that he did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>What about the formal visit versus the informal back in the Philippines, in your
                    relationships with the Filipinos? Was that important? Did informal play any role
                    in your relationship?</p>
                <p>CHECCHI: Yes, very much so. Probably more in the Philippines than in the European
                    countries. The Philippines was a tiny tack-on to the Marshall Plan. When I
                    traveled for the Marshall Plan on the trade problems, there was a considerable
                    formality. One didn't just call a European or a Permanent Secretary on the
                    telephone and say, “I'm coming over.”</p>
                <p>In the Philippines, we had a common language, of course, and a tradition of
                    hospitality which exists to this day. But I don't think the Filipinos are
                    typical. The informal there is more important than elsewhere. But they still
                    stand on their dignity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any other last thoughts we should leave on
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHECCHI: I don't know. I would say this, but it's not anything that is
                    earth-shaking, and I think it comes as much from consulting work we do as it
                    does from my government experience. That is try and keep the programs simple but
                    important, and don't spread yourself too thinly. That's a good rule for either
                    business or government.</p>
