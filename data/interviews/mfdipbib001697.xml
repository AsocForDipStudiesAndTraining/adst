                <p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY CHESTER ARTHUR CROCKER</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>
                <p>Initial Interview date: June 5, 2006</p>
                <p>Copyright 2011 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's start at the beginning. When and where were you
                        born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Born in New York City, October 29 of 1941.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family. Let's take your
                        father's side, sort of the Crocker side, first, then we'll move to your
                        mother's side. Where are they from and what do you know about them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yeah, my father's side is from New York, also, before that, from both
                    Albany, New York and New England. And the Crocker side primarily from
                    Massachusetts, originally, going back to the 18th century and before. The
                    Crockers came out of the western shires of the UK. People who were named Crocker
                    made crockery in the old days. So that's kind of the root of the word.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the Crockers doing in Massachusetts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: They were into finance and trade and the church, a little bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What church?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>CROCKER: Baptist and then Episcopal. If you go way back you'll find lots of Old
                    Testament names in the Crocker lineages. And then on my father's other side, the
                    Albany types, the name up there was Masten. Arthur Masten was my father's
                    grandfather and he was the nephew of Chester Alan Arthur, the 19th century
                    president. So the Masten side is kind of Albany based and is important in my
                    life because Albany was the jumping off place for the Adirondack Mountains and I
                    spent my youth, when I could get away from school, fishing in the Adirondacks
                    and still have property up there that I like to visit in that wonderful part of
                    the country. So those are the roots, on that side. On my mother's side, her
                    maiden name was Verdi, as in Giuseppe Verdi, only not directly descended.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Joe Green.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Joe Green, exactly, good old Joe Green. She also was a native of New
                    York. Her father had come over at a very young age from Italy, so, more recent
                    arrivals in the country. But I guess you'd have to say I'm a born and bred New
                    Yorker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What line of business was your father in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: He was an investment banker, working in a number of Wall Street firms
                    and then retired at a fairly young age and became a fulltime environmentalist, a
                    very, very active environmentalist in the New York area and was for some years
                    the chairman of an upstate New York environmental activist group called the
                    Association for the Protection of the Adirondacks. He stayed active in that
                    until his dying days, which were actually just about a year and a half ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you father go to college and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes, he was a Princeton grad and Harvard Business School.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your mother, was she active in affairs, or what was
                        she?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I would describe her as exposed to the arts and she adored high culture.
                    She loved travel, music and foreign languages. Her father was a great collector
                    of operatic music and other music, had a marvelous collection of old 78s that I
                    can still remember fiddling around with. She was an amateur singer, loved the
                    opera and I think the arts were probably her main interest in life, apart from
                    family.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She go to college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: No, she did not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you grew up right in New York City itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Grew up in New York City and then moved to areas just outside it, in one
                    case to a town called Suffern, New York, right on the New Jersey border, about
                    thirty minutes or so from New York City. Today it's probably longer, then it was
                    thirty minutes. And then we also moved out to Long Island, which is where my
                    father had grown up, near Oyster Bay, on the north shore of Long Island.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your father, you mention Oyster Bay, at all, was there
                        any contact of any nature between his love for the environment and Teddy
                        Roosevelt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure. In fact, the place in the Adirondacks that was
                    in my family, had been in my family for some generations was a staging place
                    when Teddy Roosevelt was informed that McKinley had been shot, he came down in a
                    series of horse-pulled relays and they stayed, they switched horses at a place
                    that is now a clubhouse where the family spends time. So I'm sure there was a TR
                    link — not a family link, just one talked about him reverently, at the family
                    dinner table one talked about TR with great reverence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of family, you have brothers, sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Two older sisters, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a small child, were you, what was sort of the family
                        like? You sit around the family dining table and talk about things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yeah, I think the general ambience was that if children are going to be
                    at the dinner table they better participate in the adult conversation or else
                    shut up, because the adults were going to have a conversation. So, one learned
                    at an early time about words and about messages and about speaking in whole
                    sentences, maybe you could say. But the exposures I really remember are not so
                    much early childhood, being a young adolescent and then wanting to be able to
                    communicate with adults at the table.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did the family fall politically?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>CROCKER: I think it's fair to say that my father was throughout his life a New
                    York Republican, a Rockefeller Republican, if you like, not the kind we
                    currently enjoy the leadership of but East Coast Republican, maybe a Hank
                    Paulsen or Chuck Hagel Republican, to be up to date. There used to be a lot of
                    Republicans on Wall Street and there still are some.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One thinks about, for many years, Jake Javits and all of
                        this</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I would add, though, that that didn't remain my dad's political
                    orientation as the party moved to the right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about religion? Did religion play much of a role or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: It was part of one's experience as a child and as an adolescent, yes. My
                    father, more than my mother, went to church on Sundays and made allusions,
                    Biblical allusions and references were not uncommon in things that he would say,
                    although they were very uncommon in things I might say. Brought up Episcopal and
                    confirmed at a tender age, but, it's derivative, I guess you could say. My
                    religious experience is derivative of his, really and when I was at home, which
                    was not all the time, he would go to church and he would ask if I wouldn't like
                    to come and join him and I sometimes did out of solidarity when I was a
                    teenager, but it was really out of solidarity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, where did you go to elementary school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: While we were living in Manhattan I went to a private school on the East
                    Side of Manhattan which was called Allen-Stevenson, which is still alive and
                    kicking, which was in the upper Seventies, off Lexington Avenue, roughly through
                    fifth grade and then we moved and I went to public junior high school in
                    Suffern, New York for a year and that was an interesting change of pace. We then
                    moved again and I went to private school for two more years on Long Island,
                    before going away to private school at Phillips Academy Andover, which I did for
                    about two and a half years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the private school in New York City, how would you
                        describe it, was it a progressive school, was it a traditional school?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>CROCKER: I'd say it was reasonably progressive in terms of a varied student
                    population of New Yorkers, many from different national origins, I'm sure but
                    private schools aren't cheap, so there was that degree of selectivity. Had a
                    very good sports program, which I liked a lot. Had a first class music program,
                    which really turned me on. I became very into playing woodwind instruments and
                    things like that while I was there at that school. Unfortunately I didn't
                    sustain it but I liked music. Music was part of my life, because my mother was
                    very musical and she had a sister and brother in law who ran a music
                    conservatory and so I got more exposure to it through them, as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the music side and other things, was there an Italian
                        streak to what you were getting from the family through your mother or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Probably so, yes, in terms of some of the musical choices. When people
                    ask me what are my roots I often say - partly in jest - that I'm one quarter
                    Italian and it's my best quarter. I don't really mean that, but it is possible
                    that my temperament and tastes have some Italian traces. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well at Suffern and also on Long Island what subjects did
                        you sort of like more than others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I'm not sure I was terribly intellectual at that stage but I'm sure
                    history and languages would have been part of what I liked. I think we had some
                    exposure to both in junior high, anyway, that I do remember. And obviously
                    reading and, I said, music. But it really wasn't 'til I got into high school and
                    then college that I developed any sense of direction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you much of a reader?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I think I was a late bloomer, probably, in that sense. I became an avid
                    reader and I'm more of a reader all the time. As you get older you begin to
                    realize the enormous depth of what you don't know. It's very exciting, constant
                    discovery. But as a teenager I was pretty focused on the immediate things, my
                    social life and my sports and what was going to happen tomorrow, rather than
                    sitting up in my room and reading Charles Dickens, which I did more of when I
                    was in high school, probably.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went away to, was it Phillips</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: At Andover, yeah.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Andover. You were there for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I stayed there until the middle of my junior year and then I had an
                    amicable parting with Andover, largely because I don't think I was, at that
                    stage of my life, fit for the rigors of that very disciplined environment, as it
                    was then. I really was something of a rebel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would have been at Andover when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I would be the class of '59 if I graduated and I left in the very early
                    months of '58.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And during the time you were there and even in junior high
                        did world events intrude much on your horizon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yeah, they were certainly starting to. There was a lot of discussion of
                    the election, of the Eisenhower-Stevenson contest, with all the discussion in
                    the house about that but also at the school and I remember having one of my
                    early political debates, with the older brother of a girlfriend, who was quite
                    convinced that Adlai Stevenson would have been a vastly superior president to
                    Ike. He drove me from New York up to Andover once and I remember debating him
                    all the way up there and of course he won every point 'cause he was about four
                    years older. That helped to refine and sharpen my awareness of some of the
                    issues in world affairs. We also had as our chaplain at Andover William Sloane
                    Coffin, who passed away recently and he helped to sharpen some of our ideas and
                    critical thinking, you could say, about different issues related to war and
                    peace and racial equality.</p>
                <p>But if I think back to what I most enjoyed as a student in those years at
                    Andover, probably history and languages, again. I became very focused on ancient
                    languages, on Latin and to a lesser extent on French, which I kept up.</p>
                <p>I forgot to mention along the way, one of the things that got me interested in
                    world affairs and superficially informed about them was being a stamp collector.
                    That was one of my early interests in life and then I kept it up, going back to
                    when I first had a surgical procedure and the parents were trying to keep me
                    happy so I got a little baby stamp collection at about age five and I kept it
                    up. Still have it to this day. But that's how I learned about political
                    boundaries and historical changes and the different names of countries and where
                    they are on maps and then began to look at maps and understand about geography.
                    That was actually a unifying experience, in a way.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Had very high standards and I had some very good friends there but I was
                    going through some issues myself at that stage of life, in the junior year. My
                    parents had divorced some years prior and I was on a fast track as an adolescent
                    and really didn't like the confinement of being in a boarding school under lock
                    and key, so to speak. So I decided that I would depart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, '58, where'd you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I went back to my dad's place. At that point he was my primary parent.
                    However, I didn't stay much with him, either. I promptly turned around and left
                    home altogether, as a young 16 year old. I just became a teenage devil. I ran
                    away from home and changed my identity and dyed my hair and got another name and
                    got myself employment using an assumed ID. So I went underground to avoid being
                    followed.</p>

                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well it's not really a crowning moment in my own history but it was in
                    one sense a shaping, a forming experience, obviously. No, I just located a place
                    where I could live in New York at low cost and emptied out my bank account, such
                    as it was and made contact with someone I knew a little bit who ran a bar on
                    Lexington Avenue and asked if he'd hire me and he hired me. Not legally, of
                    course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did you keep this up?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>CROCKER: I kept up my new life, my independent life, I like to call it, for about
                    a year and three quarters and then I realized the time was passing and I had
                    reconciled a bit with my father and mother and probably wouldn't be a bad idea
                    if I kept up with my age cohort and try to get into a university. I never
                    finished high school and at that point I had ripped it up, academically
                    speaking, but I did have some advanced SAT scores from the beginning of my
                    junior year. Those got me accepted on a probationary basis to a place where I
                    had a distant connection, which was Ohio State University and I decided to go. I
                    knew that I wasn't going to be competitive at the kind of school my father would
                    have wanted me to go to but I was a rebel, anyway. So what the hell, I'll try
                    going out beyond the Alleghenies and see what Ohio is like, and I went out and
                    registered at this enormous campus of what was then 48,000 students, it's
                    probably more like 70,000 today and I actually became very connected to my peers
                    but also connected to myself and to my sense of direction at Ohio State. It was
                    a good experience for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at Ohio State from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Full four years, from fall of '59 to the June of '63.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Ohio State, did you have trouble sort of adjusting or
                        did the system more or less take care of you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, it's a good question because the system there was one in which
                    every high school graduate is admitted until they flunk out and they put you
                    into a lottery and you draw three roommates and that was quite a different
                    experience for me. But, I had spent the previous year and a half, two years
                    living in a cold water walkup apartment in a Puerto Rican neighborhood in New
                    York City on $25 a week. That's how I had been living. So I had broken away from
                    the somewhat protective, sheltered environment in which I was raised in New York
                    and therefore the adjustment out there in Ohio was one I enjoyed and I met some
                    interesting people of very varied backgrounds: army brats, air force brats, the
                    kids from farms, kids whose parents worked in the tire plants in Akron and
                    diesel locomotive repair plants, kids from all sorts of backgrounds and it was a
                    very broadening experience and I enjoyed it. Ohio State had at that stage (and
                    probably still does), a strong honors program and they would reach out to people
                    they thought might be capable of handling that and they recruit you into it and
                    so if you did okay you got some recognition. You got, as a student there, if you
                    were in the upper tier of performers you probably got more attention than you
                    might have back East at a big Ivy school. In any case, I really took off
                    academically at Ohio State and became, I was straight As, Phi Beta Kappa and
                    everything and I really enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of thing were you concentrating on there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>CROCKER: History, well first of all it was languages, I majored in languages for
                    the first year, I declared a major in languages at the end of my first year and
                    then I switched to history with a minor in languages and then in my third year I
                    made it a double major in history and political science, which got me obviously
                    closer and closer to international relations. But the core of the interest was
                    history with languages, at the outset.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: History, which</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: European.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: European history.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: European history and diplomatic history and diplomatic history of the
                    U.S. and European diplomatic history. Actually I did an honors thesis in British
                    history, which took me the better part of a year and I was working in primary
                    source materials. Had a wonderful professor who gave me all kinds of stuff,
                    access to primary sources through interlibrary loan, political party newspapers
                    from the turn of the century, (previous century) in the UK and to some extent
                    France. So I was working in those kinds of things, comparing British and French
                    colonial policies before the Great War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That got you into the African thing, didn't it, or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, in a way, it was all part of a process, that's exactly right. The
                    focus of that work was primarily British, with a minor on the French side, but
                    it got me into study of the events leading up to World War I, in broadest sense,
                    including North Africa, including the Balkans, including events that surrounded
                    the “sick man of Europe,” the Ottoman Empire as it was declining, but also the
                    issues flowing out of the Boer War, which was for the British a huge experience,
                    a very major experience and issues of reform in British India, the Belgian
                    experience in the Congo, those kinds of things were part and parcel of that
                    research work. So, yeah, it very much oriented me to what had taken place in the
                    relationships between Europe as an imperial power center and the non-European
                    parts of the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at your courses, you say you had quite a bit of
                        diplomatic history, was there a different focus, this was a different era in
                        a way and you're much involved in this today, in one way and another,
                        including teaching. Did you see, was diplomatic history taught differently,
                        in your experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>CROCKER: Well it certainly was taught differently in lots of ways. Of course I
                    continued on in graduate school in some of these same areas and we had different
                    people teaching it then. I was taught American diplomatic history, U.S.
                    diplomatic history, by Foster Rhea Dulles, who was of the Dulles family, at Ohio
                    State and that was a real treat. We had a hell of a history department at Ohio
                    State. I don't know if we still do, but we did then, really good people. Had
                    Harvey Goldberg teaching French revolutionary history and 19th century French
                    history, Philip Poirier teaching the history of the British Labour Party, which
                    he at that stage was one of the great authorities on. So, yeah, you obviously
                    follow in the tracks to some extent of the professors who turn you on and who
                    get you motivated. I think the European diplomatic history came later. It was
                    more the history of European countries that I was getting at that stage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well speaking of movements and all, '59 to '63, did the
                        Kennedy-Nixon election engage you at all in 1960, because this was a turning
                        point for an awful lot of people ended up in the Foreign Service, I
                        think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I think it probably did, yeah. Once Kennedy had won, there's no doubt
                    that his message was one that reached a lot of us, including myself. The
                    creation of the Peace Corps, for example, something that was destined to be an
                    experience that would affect the minds of young people. We had one of the first
                    Peace Corps training programs anywhere in the country at Ohio State and there
                    were lots and lots of Peace Corps volunteers being trained on our campus, in
                    different disciplines for different parts of the world. We also had some people
                    working in our political science department who were quite interested in
                    emerging Africa at that stage and of course 1960 was the year in which many
                    African countries became independent, not all of them but many of them. So there
                    were visiting lecture series and the fact that the Peace Corps was going to some
                    West African countries was very much on my mind. So I associated all that with
                    the kind of uplifting message that Kennedy represented when it came to U.S.
                    relations with the emerging nations. I guess you could say I bought the
                    Kool-Aid, the hopeful message that maybe there could be a new era and new
                    relations with these countries but at the same time with a very clear reference
                    point that these places in Africa, the Middle East had been run for many years
                    by Europeans and Europeans knew them very well. And so I was a kind of person
                    who was deeply conflicted by the whole experience of Suez, as I look back on it
                    at that point and the stance that Eisenhower had taken at Suez, which of course
                    had two consequences: it saved the British and the French and the Israelis from
                    a real mess in the Suez Canal Zone but they didn't like it very much and it
                    drove the British and the French out of the empire business, it accelerated
                    their decolonialization process.</p>

                <p>CROCKER: Didn't help, no.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I was young and naive enough to want to believe there were, there might
                    be some possibility for getting better relations with Moscow, but I was
                    disabused of that on a number of occasions, not least, one of my experiences on
                    the Ohio State campus was becoming president of the student YMCA and YWCA, which
                    were kind of a joint entity on campus and I ran a speakers program there, made
                    it a point of reaching out to different kinds of speakers to come on the campus.
                    So we had debates between the, there was a socialist party, the Socialist Labor
                    Party of Ohio, they had a political party and the John Birch Society and
                    everybody in between was offered a platform at the YMCA to come and talk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The John Birch Society was an extreme right wing</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: It was and it was founded out in that region of the country. So they
                    were strongly represented but the Socialist Labor Party came to speak on campus
                    at my invitation and the Birchers were furious that I would allow them to come
                    and speak. So I got in the middle of some of that. We even had some Russians
                    come to speak, some Soviet types, they were so-called Soviet youth leaders, most
                    of whom were in their forties, and I got a taste of what it was like when I was
                    trying to host a meeting between them and some other people and soon realized
                    that they were only interested in ideological warfare, not communication. This
                    was my first taste of the way the Soviets conducted their 'people to people
                    diplomacy'. They were about as bad, on their side, as some of the worst of the
                    Birchers on the other side. The idea of getting a serious and substantive
                    dialogue going, forget it. Wrong era, wrong players.</p>

                        at Ohio State or could it survive there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: As I'm sure you know, Columbus, Ohio is not a hotbed of progressivism
                    the way San Francisco is but it is a state capital of a state that's often been
                    seen as conservative. Some people call southern Ohio part of the Bible belt. And
                    so I would say that the campus environment reflected the full variety but it was
                    remarkably cosmopolitan and especially that was true of the social sciences and
                    languages. That is often the case. Many of the faculty came from other places
                    and the best of them were world class and I was very lucky to be associated with
                    them and trained by them. I remember having a lot of economics with a labor
                    economists who was quite well known in the American labor movement and favorably
                    known, as well as some development economics. But most of the economics I
                    learned was Paul Samuelson and it was pretty straightforward economics.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yeah, I think so, back then, especially. So nothing terribly unusual
                    about that. But if you look at the broader environment of a campus like Ohio
                    State it was a big land grant university, 80,000 people went to football every
                    Saturday in the fall and they all cheered for the home team and if you didn't
                    have that in your bloodstream you shouldn't be there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I remember it pretty well from the headlines and I remember the scare
                    stories and how dramatic it seemed to be and it was in fact a very real crisis.
                    How real it was I don't think I fully appreciated.. It's a little hard to
                    appreciate it when you live in a town that has one newspaper and it's always
                    saying the same thing, anyway. So it just didn't seem all that immediate, as it
                    probably should have. It was a scary time, looking back on it. I remember the
                    discussions about bomb shelters and having campus briefings about bomb shelters
                    and what should we do. Civil defense, I first heard the words civil defense in
                    '62, '63, as I guess we all did.</p>

                        political science, what was the state of it, because political science, my
                        understanding is, has gotten very computer oriented and formulas and all
                        that sort of thing. Where stood political science?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: History never, at that stage, was infiltrated by those unfortunate
                    pseudo -scientific diseases. It may be now but it wasn't then. Political science
                    was just at the beginnings of the great debates about which kind of political
                    science, is it going to be normative, is it going to be essentially political
                    philosophy? And what I learned in political science was either on the political
                    philosophy side or alternatively comparative politics, comparative government
                    and politics, which I really very much enjoyed. The study of different
                    countries' political systems, reading from great American writers, British
                    writers and French writers about the different qualities of political systems,
                    political party formation. We had some focus on systems theory in international
                    relations. I'm talking about the early Sixties now, when that stuff was just
                    getting going but it was not quantitative so much until the middle and late
                    Sixties. I managed to duck and miss most of that quantitative stuff.</p>

                    today who think about getting a doctorate in political science and I realize
                    what hideous choices they face in light of the discipline's quantification
                    imperative.</p>

                        to graduate in '63, what do you see for yourself? How were you pointed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, it's a good question. I guess, like many impressionable young
                    people, I was very inspired and probably shaped by the professors who meant the
                    most to me, even though one of them was smart enough to tell me, “Above all
                    else, don't ever take career guidance from one of your teachers, because the
                    only think he can give you guidance on is how to be a teacher and unless you
                    really want to be a teacher, don't look at us as your role models.” Well, even
                    though that was very wise I'm not sure I followed it at the time. I knew I
                    wanted to go to graduate school, into the international studies field. What I
                    wasn't sure of was whether to do regional studies or simply international
                    relations studies. So I applied to a bunch of different schools and, having done
                    well out there, I got into all of them and then had the choice of where to
                    go.</p>
                <p>I selected Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies here in
                    Washington over the others. One of the reasons I did is that it was connected to
                    the world of policy, government, public service, as well as the academic world,
                    and because SAIS then as it does now, had a PhD program. And it seemed to me
                    that would keep my options open. I could do the sort of policy relevant
                    international studies but I could also, if I chose to, go on for a PhD. I didn't
                    want to make that decision necessarily at the beginning, whereas some school
                    would probably want you to make an early decision: are you a PhD student or
                    not?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At SAIS and also at Ohio State, was there a growing body
                        of academic interest in Africa because of the changes there or, were you

                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes, indeed. Africa was coming into its own as a focus of regional
                    studies, area studies. One shouldn't forget that we used to have the National
                    Defense Education Act, which used to promote and sponsor study of exotic areas
                    and the Africanist community, which was never huge but grew like Topsy in the
                    Sixties and Seventies, took full advantage of that and built a whole series of
                    African studies programs. One of the early ones was at SAIS Johns Hopkins but
                    the more purely academic ones were at places like Wisconsin Madison, Boston
                    University, Northwestern were some of the earliest ones but in terms of policy
                    focus SAIS seemed to be a good one. Columbia also, I should mention.</p>

                        because so often policy seems to be pretty well removed from people get
                        involved in academic world, it's more fun to sit there and create your
                        doughnuts or whatever this is and not think about, okay, what do we do about
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>CROCKER: I'm not certain where this bug caught me. It may have caught me in part
                    because there were always those nagging questions about what are you going to do
                    for a living and what are you going to do for a career and while I admired
                    faculty people I wasn't certain that was the only choice I should consider. I
                    had been exposed at Ohio State and much more so of course at SAIS to a number of
                    practitioners and I found them impressive, on the whole, people I could look up
                    to. I suspect that my dad's influence may have been there in the background a
                    little bit, too, the notion that there is something about public service which
                    is valid and worthy. If I'd done all of the things that my father wanted me to I
                    would have become an investment banker, having gone to Andover, then probably
                    Princeton or Yale and wound up doing something in his footsteps. I never went
                    that route but he always had another side to him, besides being an investment
                    banker, which was the world of ideas, the world of concepts, the world of
                    beliefs. That, no doubt, had some influence.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at SAIS from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: '63 I started, got my masters in '65 and got my PhD in '69, having taken
                    a year off between the masters and the start of PhD studies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well as you were getting your masters and on your way
                        towards your PhD, were you having much of a chance to rub shoulders with the
                        practitioners? Was SAIS set up for that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: SAIS was very much set for that. SAIS has some outstanding, I'd call
                    them scholar-practitioners or scholar-diplomats, even. It also had some people
                    who were pretty much top of the pops in their field at the time. People like
                    Robert Osgood, whose writings on limited war were the number one authority in
                    the country, along with Henry Kissinger, perhaps. I'm talking about the mid- and
                    late Sixties, now. People like Arnold Wolfers, who was the Swiss-born,
                    Yale-based and then SAIS-based scholar who probably did more than anything else
                    to influence my thinking about international politics.</p>
                <p>Wolfers was a marvelous man. He ran the Foreign Policy Institute at SAIS, which
                    was like an in-house think tank and he collected people around him who were,
                    like Osgood, like George Liska, like Charles Burton Marshall, the list went on.
                    There was some pretty big name people who were, who taught courses and were very
                    much what you'd call students of American foreign policy. And they brought an
                    endless stream of practitioners to SAIS to speak to us about everything from
                    economic development to intervention in Vietnam to limited war and
                    counterinsurgency to the impact of decolonization on the international political
                    system, that kind of thing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there the feeling that the United States, did you have
                        it and maybe those around you, that the United States had a role to play in
                        the world, rather than just sort of sit back, that we were a city on the
                        hill, the missionary, something like that. Was this part of the zeitgeist of
                        the period, would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes, the Sixties are a decade that I guess are just doomed to be a
                    subject of endless controversy and discussion. I'm always amazed to this day
                    that when you go to college campuses you see history and political science
                    professors who've never gotten out of the Sixties, teaching full courses on the
                    Sixties. And of course it's their Sixties that you're learning about, not
                    somebody else's Sixties. For me the Sixties were a turning point in every
                    respect and probably a formative time, but formative in ways that might be a
                    little bit out of the ordinary. Yes, I think to answer your question directly, I
                    never had any doubt that the United States of America was the logical successor
                    to the British Empire as the number one source of security, stability and order
                    in international politics. I didn't have any doubt then. I don't have any doubt
                    now. If the United States isn't doing a kind of modern version of the role that
                    the Brits played in the 19th century and before, who on Earth would be doing
                    it?</p>

                        but one can't helpbut feel that the United States is sort of the
                        indispensable country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes, I certainly saw it as natural, inevitable. Of course the debates
                    were over what kind of role were we to play.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time, did SAIS represent a, as some of the
                        think tanks did, was it a shadow government or was this more just plain
                        practitioners, as opposed to people who were sort of teachers and all or
                        people who were lecturers, waiting for the administration to change and they
                        would step forth. Did you have that feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: A lot of our best courses at SAIS were taught, especially the more
                    applied courses, were taught by adjunct people, who had day jobs — in the World
                    Bank, day jobs in the CIA, day jobs with the State Department (including INR),
                    day jobs in Congress. I learned European and to some degree American diplomatic
                    history from a fellow named Seth Tillman at SAIS. No, I guess a number of the
                    faculty went into the Nixon Administration, but not that many. The main example
                    was Bob Osgood who went into the National Security Council, which is the reason
                    that I followed him, shortly after he went in. Probably less common then than it
                    is now.</p>

                <p>CROCKER: You know, the time I was doing my course work at SAIS were the years
                    '63-65, a little bit of '66, getting ready for the PhD comps and the debate
                    hadn't become quite red hot in our country yet, although it was getting there
                    and you could sense it. There were some student meetings, there were some
                    protests, not too many. The real protests kicked up in '67, '68 and at that
                    point I was actually overseas and doing PhD research. I remember coming back
                    with my wife in '67 and being amazed at what had happened and what the
                    atmosphere was like in this country over Vietnam, being amazed and being worried
                    about the war and its impact on the U.S., and being pleased when President
                    Lyndon Johnson made the decision (in 1968) to run again. Like so many others, I
                    mourned Jack Kennedy's assassination. In the late 60's I sampled the anti-war
                    protests, to see if they made me comfortable and if I was comfortable with the
                    people who were protesting. I kind of decided that I wasn't all that comfortable
                    with the mainstream of the protests, because it seemed to me that it was what
                    Jeane Kirkpatrick would later call the “blame American first crowd” that was
                    dominating the Vietnam debate, rather than people who were thinking through what
                    we had done wrong there, what we had misanalyzed, what strategic errors we
                    committed, and what we should do to get ourselves out without incurring all the
                    negative consequences that might flow from an early withdrawal or disengagement
                    from Vietnam. So I was not in the school that just said cut and run, but I was
                    deeply troubled by the war and its impact at home and around the world..</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I don't think I made that decision about whether it would lead to an
                    academic or a non-academic career. I was sending out letters to quite a few
                    schools as an international relations PhD about to be minted and what I was
                    getting back I found unimpressive. By then political science departments were
                    either moving in the quantitative, heavily methodological directions (which did
                    not interest me and which I was not trained for by SAIS) or they were deciding
                    definitively not to; and I think Vietnam was probably part of it as well. Too
                    many campuses were caught up in populist uproars. I just didn't find the market
                    very interesting, but I was still writing my doctorate and then I happened to
                    have the good fortune to be asked if I would like to try government for a while,
                    so that started me on that road.</p>
                <p>The PhD that I wrote I think is probably the most formative thing, if anything,
                    in terms answering your question. I decided to write a comparison of the way the
                    British and the French decolonized their empires, particularly in the security
                    sphere. And for the rest of my career I've been interested in security
                    relationships between the North and the South, between Europe and Africa, Europe
                    and the Middle East and the legacies flowing from those experiences which formed
                    much of the backdrop for America's rise to global power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you talk about security relationships, what do you
                        mean?</hi>

                <p>CROCKER: Defense relationships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Defense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Defense in terms of military relationships. I'd worked on some ACDA
                    contracts with my PhD mentor, Vernon McKay, which looked at things like arms
                    transfers to the developing world and the significance of these arms transfers
                    and what could be done to limit or channel arms transfers so that they became a
                    force not for instability but for stability and all the rest. So to me the most
                    interesting dynamic was, how will these newly emergent states become capable of
                    being sovereign, especially in the security sphere? At the time of independence,
                    many did not have the means for sovereignty; many of these countries, especially
                    the African ones, had been colonies for such a short time that their national
                    identity was very weak, the institutions were nowhere near as deeply imbedded as
                    they were, let's say, in British India and what kind of security forces were
                    they going to have? Where were they going to get their training from? How big
                    were they going to be? What was their doctrine going to be? Would they have
                    alliance relationships with former metropoles, the former colonial powers? Would
                    they have alliance relations with the Russians, with the Chinese, with the
                    Americans? Who was, in other words, going to take over the kind of imperial
                    role, if you want to look at it in that way, in the security sphere or was no
                    one going to take it over? Was it going to be run by Arabs in the Middle East
                    and by Africans in Africa and by Asians in Southeast Asia? Those were the kind
                    of questions that I was tangling with and found absolutely engrossing, and I've
                    spent my career thinking about those sorts of things - the security linkages
                    between regions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were working on your PhD and all, this is a time
                        when both the French and British were inserting troops in from time to time.
                        I think the British went into Kenya at one point, didn't they and Tanzania
                        and also to Kuwait, I think and perhaps elsewhere. And the French, of
                        course, were doing this all the time. Were you seeing that the metropoles
                        were really withdrawing or were they stuck with the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes, they were stuck with the problem and of course we were stuck with
                    the implications of decisions they made about their problem. I think most
                    Americans and even well informed Americans are not aware of the fact that the
                    British and French armed forces were at war almost nonstop from 1945 'til about
                    1970, in one way or another. Now whether it was French Indo-China, whether it
                    was French in Algeria, whether it was the British in Malaya or the Mau Mau
                    campaign in Kenya or, as you mentioned, fire brigade operations in places like
                    Kuwait and East Africa and, for the French, in west and central Africa. Right
                    after they decolonized Kuwait, the then Iraqi government decided to have a bite
                    of it, back in '62, I think it was. And the Brits sent in a heavy brigade back
                    in again to reinforce Kuwait's independence.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>So I was intrigued by these kinds of issues, not so much in an advocacy sense as
                    in terms of, how is this going to work? These are new countries, trying to get
                    on their feet, with every right to get on their feet, but they do not have the
                    basis for sovereignty. And they're going to have to build the basis for
                    sovereignty. You can't build that on the basis of clich�s about the history of
                    oppression and exploitation. You can't build a country on a clich�. (This is a
                    line that I learned from a particular SAIS instructor, I won't pin it on him but
                    it struck me for years to follow.) Countries cannot be built on clich�s, you
                    actually have to have some substance. You have to have institutions that work,
                    you have to have people who will follow orders. You have to have the skills and
                    the competence to operate and maintain equipment, and sometimes it helps to know
                    that there's somebody external who cares enough to strengthen your systems when
                    they get challenged and get in difficulty.</p>
                <p>Of course that line of thinking, which sounds neo-imperial in some ways, is what
                    explains a lot of the debates that we saw in the relations between the advanced
                    industrial societies and the developing world throughout the Sixties, Seventies,
                    Eighties, even the Nineties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at, particularly the Middle East and Africa, we're
                        still stuck with the problem of tribalism. Iraq is a tribal problem. Do you
                        feel that there was enough understanding that this tribalism is really going
                        to screw things up, as far as building democracies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I think the experience of writing my thesis and then early years in
                    government, I lost my optimistic view of the ease of transitioning from empire
                    to independence, in many of these countries, for the reason you indicate and
                    also because it takes time to build indigenous institutions. I remember being so
                    appalled at the lack of historical knowledge in the United States in 2002-3, the
                    lead up to the Iraq War, that there wasn't a single prominent talking head who
                    could make a literate reference to Britain's experience in Iraq between the two
                    world wars. Not a single personality that I can think of made public reference,
                    in a TV show or in an op-ed, to what I thought of as simply common knowledge but
                    it wasn't common knowledge to most people my age or younger who were
                    participating in this debate about whether to go to war in Iraq. Britain had a
                    hideous experience in Iraq and a tough time coping with its intervention
                    legacies throughout the Middle East, and I was familiar with the story because I
                    had written my PhD about what Britain was doing in these areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was summed up in many ways by this movie about
                        it, The Lost Patrol. A small patrol get stuck in the middle of the Iraq
                        desert and gets slaughtered.</hi>

                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>COCKER: I would have thought that the Seven Pillars of Wisdom was kind of common
                    knowledge to people and people would have, in any event, the book that people
                    all should have read before we got into Iraq was written by Elizabeth Monroe and
                    it was called Britain's Moment in the Middle East, From 1914 to Suez. And anyone
                    who is vaguely familiar with that history would have had the wisdom to ask
                    themselves this question: “Okay, so we go into Baghdad and then what? What do
                    you do then?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just talking to somebody who's husband has a rather
                        significant role in Baghdad now and just in passing said that, reckoned that
                        we had a thirty per cent chance of coming out all right on that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, maybe. Maybe so. But these were the issues that were the formative
                    ones for me as I was developing elements of a career and thinking about career
                    choices, government or academia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were working on this, you're talking about
                        clich�s and all, there was a rather starry-eyed feeling about Africa, the
                        winds of change and things are really going to be much greater. In the
                        Middle East you had these military dictatorships that took over almost
                        immediately and they were brutal and you didn't quite get that same feeling,
                        but certainly in Africa. Nkrumah was the bright eyed boy, Nyerere and
                        intellectuals sort of embraced these people who really weren't doing their
                        country that much good, at least it's debatable. Did you find yourself
                        engaged in this, or sitting to one side? How'd you find yourself? I'm
                        talking about while you were in the academic world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes and I should mention, during the late Sixties (much of '66, '67, and
                    '68) I was a news editor, when I was in Washington, of a magazine called Africa
                    Report, which had detailed monthly coverage based on some three or four hundred
                    then hard copy news sources that we would receive by mail, in those old days and
                    we would have a news section about every African country every month, a news
                    bulletin of some sort or another. And I became more and more aware of what, in
                    fact, African politics was likely to be. And so the bloom was off the rose, so
                    to speak. It was clear we were talking about one variety or another of one party
                    regimes, of regimes that one scholar called 'party states', if not outright
                    military dictatorships. These were weak countries with weak governments that
                    were scared of their own shadows and so what they did was to try to prevent any
                    alternative power centers from arising. Which meant you didn't want an
                    autonomous private sector, you didn't want opposition parties, you didn't want
                    foreign investment, you didn't want a lot of things unless you carefully could
                    control them.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Of course there was some variety in the African experience. Some countries, like
                    Nyerere's Tanzania, were a more or less benign form of one-partyism. Not so
                    benign for the people who were the victims of his Ujamaa village socialism but
                    not bloody, it was simply backward, bad economics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course the five hundred pound gorilla was South Africa
                        during this time and, again, from the academic side, what were you getting
                        from your colleagues and your own set of thinking about whither South
                        Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I served in the Nixon, I like to call it the Nixon-Kissinger
                    Administration from 1969 to 1972 and then came to the academic world. My first
                    academic job that was fulltime was here in Georgetown University, where I was
                    affiliated from '72 until 1980, when I went back into government again, that
                    time in the State Department. I think my views were formed very heavily by the
                    years of working for Henry Kissinger, whose photo I still has a place of pride
                    in my office, right there. Henry Kissinger's form of realism I always thought of
                    as congenial to my own thinking. I should add that the kind of attitudes and
                    decisions that the U.S. took in the early Seventies towards Africa struck me as
                    hyper realist in a way, in some ways waiting until things got hot before dealing
                    with them, rather than acting proactively and preemptively.</p>
                <p>And we faced some difficult choices here and there, to do with Portuguese
                    speaking Africa and what kind of relationship we had with Portugal, a NATO ally,
                    which was of course urging us to be their ally politically and militarily in
                    Africa . And while we didn't want to be their ally in Africa, nor did we want to
                    see the Soviets and the Cubans and others take over in those Portuguese
                    colonies. So we had quite an interesting debate, as you'll recall, in the
                    mid-Seventies, by which time I was out of government, about how to conduct
                    ourselves in places like Mozambique and Angola.</p>
                <p>Another insurgency which was getting underway as of '67 was the Rhodesian
                    insurgency, which led ultimately to various British diplomatic interventions and
                    ultimately Anglo-American plans for settlement and then the so-called Lancaster
                    House talks leading to the independence of Rhodesia/Zimbabwe in 1980.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>South Africa, as you mention, was the big looming question. And for most of the
                    time period that we are talking about up to now, nobody doubted that South
                    Africa would be able to defend itself and its racist system for the indefinite
                    future. It had been around for a long time. It had started, really in the
                    1700's. In 1653 is when settlement began, not unlike when our own settlement
                    began. So it's a long history there. The other milestones that were important in
                    my mind was the Act of Union in 1910, which created the modern South Africa
                    after the Boer War and then of course the election of 1948, which brought the
                    Afrikaner Nationalists into power with a particularly virulent form of white
                    nationalism inspired to some degree by doctrines from the Europe in the 1930's.
                    A kind of institutionalized, racist nationalism, I guess you could call it. And
                    it was ugly and I was very sensitive to its ugliness and very convinced that it
                    would need to change, but the question was how, under what circumstances.</p>
                <p>And this was an overwhelming question for everyone in the Africanist community.
                    We all knew South Africa was not acceptable in its current form, but how do you
                    go from here to there and what is there, anyway? What is the end point?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, still working on the time you're working on your
                        PhD, did you find that those looking at Africa from the academic point of
                        view were for the most part looking at it through rose colored glasses or by
                        this time, the Sixties and all, was the bloom off the rose?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: The bloom was off the rose by the late Sixties, early Seventies. Those
                    parts of the academic world that I was the closest to would have been in two
                    camps. One campwas what I call the military sociologists, the people in
                    comparative politics (as political scientists call it) who were studying the
                    role of the African military, which was then, as you can imagine, a big emerging
                    story with coup d'etat and coup d'etat. Were these uniformed people going to be
                    emerging as they had in Turkey? There were scholars who had looked at the role
                    of the military in Turkey's modernization and said, “Well, is there any
                    potential here for a kind of African Atat�rk, for real modernization, political
                    modernization, to come from the officer corps of these kinds of societies or was
                    the military simply an armed trade union movement, an urban-based trade union
                    movement, out for its own interests, out for a bigger share of the budget and
                    for the perks of office and never to leave?” Or was the military simply a
                    guardian, doing a transitional role, until the next civilian leadership could be
                    identified? What forms of governance would be likely to develop and what were
                    its implications? So that was one group of academics and I had some interaction
                    with them and wrote some journal articles in that company.</p>
                <p>And of course the other were very, very different kinds of scholars. They were
                    scholars of counterinsurgency, scholars of what you'd call global security,
                    scholars wondering about what these disruptive parts of the world called the
                    'new nations' were going to mean for the Cold War rivalry between the United
                    States and the Soviet Union.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>So I was in two camps, here. One camp was sort of regionalist, looking at what
                    kind of states and societies are emerging and the other camp very much
                    globalist, how should be conduct ourselves as one of the two poles in a bipolar
                    system, in order to make sure that ultimately the 'right side' prevails and we
                    didn't misread the African tea leaves. I was very concerned that we might
                    overreact and intervene in a mindless way, obviously a lesson of Vietnam. You
                    don't just buy the local Kool-Aid, whatever some dictator is trying to sell you.
                    On the other hand, if you leave an empty chair, in a competitive bipolar system
                    somebody else will fill it. So you have to walk the line between the regionalist
                    and the globalist perspectives, with case by case care and real due
                    diligence.</p>
                <p>And that's what I took from it and I will confess that most of the Africanist
                    professoriate was not interested in that discussion. They assumed that Africa is
                    for the Africans, that we shouldn't be involved as a Cold War player, that we
                    shouldn't be concerned if countries professed Marxism, as many of them did. We
                    shouldn't be concerned if the Soviets, Cubans, East Germans, Chinese, others
                    developed what you might call inroads of influence in different African
                    countries because, not to worry, Africans can defend themselves and they will do
                    so and the outsiders will never have permanent influence. I found this debate to
                    be kind of sterile, because to me the question was, all right, maybe eventually
                    the Africans will throw them out, but what happens in the meantime and at what
                    price?</p>
                <p>So we have to watch carefully and not leave vacuums, but also not create stupid
                    messes by inflating the Cold War dimension and applying only a Cold War
                    lens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well during your and again your PhD time, did you get a
                        chance to, say, go to France and to the UK and to sample their thoughts and
                        how they were going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes, exactly, that's what I was doing. I spent a year in British and
                    French libraries and British and French colonial and foreign offices and defense
                    departments, interviewing officials and academics. And then another part of a
                    year talking to officials of the newly created Organization of African Unity and
                    doing some case studies related to some of the themes in my thesis. And what I
                    was discovering is that the European taste for 'imperial' burdens was rapidly
                    disappearing but they did feel a residual need to remain relevant and capable,
                    if asked by their political masters. So you could sense there was a transition
                    underway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The French seem to, what I gather, had more of a feeling
                        that this is our preserve and they should absorb our culture. The French
                        seem to take more of a proprietary interest, or not? You find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes, no question, there was a real and sharp distinction between the
                    British and the French approaches, partly based on the way they decolonized
                    their possessions. The British were retail, ad hoc decolonizers. Each country
                    got independence at a different time period under a different set of internal
                    political developments, constitutional conferences, negotiations and so on and
                    it kind of spread over a period of time, starting with Ghana in '57 and all the
                    way down to Swaziland in '68, I guess. So most of the sub-Saharan British
                    territories got independence within that time frame.</p>
                <p>Nearly all the French territories got independence in one year, 1960, as a result
                    of negotiations that were led by the French system in Paris, by Charles de
                    Gaulle negotiating with African leaders who were emerging and creating something
                    called the French Community, which was all linked together with very detailed,
                    elaborate defense agreements, internal security agreements, agreements on
                    telecommunications, air traffic control, higher education, you name it. This was
                    a highly structured system that you could call quasi-independence, in some ways.
                    And then the French, also, their territories tended to be weaker economically
                    and smaller in terms of size and population. So they were more dependent on
                    France anyway. If you look at the map and look at Chad, Chad has seldom really
                    been able to stand on its feet without the French being there, even to this
                    day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you actually finish your PhD process before going to
                        the NSC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I got my PhD in '69 and went into government in '69.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you come to any conclusion and what was your feeling
                        about the African leadership that you were getting by the time you</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I think the feeling I had come to by the end of this process of
                    preparing myself in terms of education was that the African transition was going
                    to be difficult, it was going to be disorderly, it was going to be a cockpit of
                    East-West rivalry to some degree and that the continuing relevance of European
                    influence in Africa was something that we should not discourage. Unless we
                    wanted to pick up all the burdens or all the roles that they were playing
                    ourselves, then it would be wise to encourage some continuity of
                    European-African relationships. At the same time, I reached the conclusion that
                    the OAU structure was a valid basis for an emerging African order and that we
                    should respect the OAU charter and look at the OAU charter as a way of keeping
                    the Russians on a tight rein, in a sense, because the OAU charter was an
                    anti-intervention charter, it was a charter for weak new states protecting
                    themselves from foreign interveners, both East and West and we should respect
                    that.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>The OAU charter, actually a resolution passed in '64, sanctified the inherited
                    boundaries and we should respect that, because what's the alternative to
                    Africa's ridiculous boundaries that have been created by the Europeans? These
                    were the kind of bottom line conclusions one came away with, that if you don't
                    have the boundaries you've got now, exactly what boundaries would you like?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were doing all these studies, did Biafra come
                        up? Did this engage the academic world who were interested in Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes, it did. I'm glad you asked. There was a very hot example of exactly
                    this question and of course it was also an example of something that always
                    bemused me, which was French-American rivalry in Africa. There were so many
                    French officials who looked at the Americans as the threat that they conducted
                    themselves accordingly and if it wasn't the Americans who were the threat it was
                    the British who were the threat. If you read French newspapers and French
                    magazines, the overwhelming sense of adversariness was towards the
                    Anglo-American expansionism, if you like, in what they looked at as their
                    strategic hinterland, namely the French speaking parts of Africa, both in the
                    north and in sub-Saharan Africa. So, yes, French support for self-determination
                    in Biafra was a test case, and example of French frustration about the
                    centrality and power of formerly British Nigeria in West Africa.</p>
                <p>It was also a test case of humanitarian intervention. It was a test case of
                    whether we believed African boundaries should be sanctified or could be
                    rewritten. A lot of things came into play. I entered government just as that
                    debate was hotting up, as a matter of fact, so it was for me an interesting
                    case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see Soviet influence in Africa as being sort of an
                        oddity? In a way, looking at it, the Soviets weren't comfortable in Africa.
                        They really didn't have any great interest. It was just sort of to mess
                        things up, in a way, or something but it just didn't seem like it had much
                        in the way of staying power, or was that the view that you had?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I think, at the period we're we talking about now, which is by the end
                    of the Sixties, early Seventies, the Soviets were not a very credible adversary
                    or rival or peer competitor in the African space. And there were several reasons
                    for that, but one of them was that the Chinese were more creative than the
                    Soviets, by far and they had a quite venturesome policy of their own. Secondly,
                    that the Soviets were hopelessly inept at relating to Africans, as you have
                    suggested. Hopelessly racist. Hopelessly condescending. And just not very
                    comfortable, perhaps, is the word. Nor was it all that clear what they wanted.
                    They didn't really back up their investment with anything very significant. One
                    had the sense that they were shopping for UN votes, maybe and not much more.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>And this gets ahead of us but it really wasn't until the Soviets discovered our
                    own vulnerabilities in the Seventies and exploited the Cuban factor that the
                    Soviet threat became a serious strategic issue, in my thinking. Before that it
                    wasn't, because the Europeans were occupying many of the chairs. And the places
                    where they weren't, where they fell apart, which was the Belgian Congo, the DRC
                    as we call it today, we came and played a very strong role, backing up the UN
                    intervention and that also limited the Soviet possibilities.</p>
                <p>So I'd say by the end of the Sixties, early Seventies I didn't think the Soviets
                    were going to have a free ride and lots of openings. I saw Africa as protected
                    by the OAU charter, by continuing European influence, by African pragmatism and
                    African leadership and by our own sort of hopefully skillful self restraint.</p>
                <p>Let me just mention one thing, which to me was so interesting and that is the
                    depth of the French fascination with and attraction to Africa. Goes back to
                    their dilemma after the Franco-Prussian War. As we know, the Prussians won that
                    war. One reason they won it was because they were better organized and had a
                    better military. Another is because Germany was growing faster than France.
                    France looked at Africa, from the 1880's on, as a manpower pool and a strategic
                    reserve of geographic depth vis-�-vis German power. The French Army built an
                    army in Africa which they called the Troupes Coloniales and it was an elaborate
                    system, elaborate structure.</p>
                <p>So one reason for their depth of resentment of Anglo-American influence, if you
                    like, was always that Africa was a kind of strategic reservoir for them. That's
                    where they fled to when the Vichy came in. That's where the Free French were.
                    They were in Africa. So if you think about it strategically, from the parochial,
                    very parochial French perspective, they didn't like the idea that the 1898
                    Fashoda crisis was going to come up again, in place after place and they wanted
                    to hold on to their primacy in these different countries, like Gabon and C�te
                    d'Ivoire and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1970, how did the call from the NSC come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>CROCKER: It's one of those situations that, I guess when you find a parking place
                    outside your favorite restaurant you say to yourself, “Either I was very lucky
                    or I was very skillful,” but you were in the right place at the right time. A
                    former professor of mine and a former head of the Washington Center of Foreign
                    Policy Research, Robert Osgood, had been playing a role for Henry Kissinger on
                    his staff of putting together a kind of planning shop within the NSC staff and
                    Bob Osgood gave me a call and asked if I'd be interested in a position that
                    would be opening within the kind of planning cell that was assembled within the
                    Kissinger staff. So I thought about that for at least forty seconds but it
                    seemed like an interesting opportunity. I talked to my wife and we were trying
                    to figure out how this would all work but I accepted the position, basically
                    because of a graduate school contact and being at a Washington area university.
                    It's a classic example of how going to graduate school in Washington can make a
                    difference for people. If you were doing this at Denver or in Boston or whatever
                    you might get fewer phone calls like that, although that's changing today, I'm
                    sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were with the NSC from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: From June of '70, roughly, until about August of '72, just a couple of
                    years, yeah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a little about, when you got there, about
                        how the NSC was perceived at the time and what it was doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: The NSC was Henry Kissinger's power base for asserting and ultimately
                    achieving mastery, or if you like domination, of the American foreign policy
                    bureaucracy. Not everybody else in the different departments would necessarily
                    agree with that characterization, but it's clear that he used the NSC system and
                    process, the study process, the review process, as a way of both asserting a
                    degree of coherence in the policy paper production process but also a degree of
                    control, by tasking, by deadlines, by having NSC representatives on all of the
                    different policy groups that were established in this fairly elaborate process
                    that he set up and also by way of keeping the bureaucracy busy while he in fact
                    was doing some of the key decision making and running some of the key policies.
                    There was resistance and push back to some extent but there's no question that
                    the series of NSSMs, study memoranda and decision memoranda that came out of the
                    Kissinger NSC process was probably the most systematic and aggressive use of the
                    NSC mechanism that anybody had ever attempted before. The staff grew from
                    whatever it was when he came in, 18 or 20, to about 55. There have been
                    subsequent uses of the NSC system by Kissinger's successors that have gone
                    beyond what he did but he was the first person who used the NSC system as a
                    power base to dominate the flow of advice and paper in quite that way into the
                    Executive Office of the President and use it for his own, as a personal
                    launching pad for himself. He became Secretary of State of course, a pattern
                    that Condi Rice has followed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there the feeling, when you got there, that William
                        Rogers, the Secretary of State, was sort of a weak member of the Nixon
                        Administration and therefore we can run over</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, I think there was a view that Bill Rogers was a gentleman and
                    played by gentleman's rules and some of Rogers' lieutenants had to end up
                    fighting the battles because Rogers wasn't looking for battles, necessarily.
                    There was some of that. Rogers was a very decent guy and he wasn't used to the
                    kind of sharp elbows of bureaucratic warfare that is typical in the modern White
                    House. I might say it's not just Kissinger-Nixon. There's a bit of this that
                    happened with Cy Vance and Zbig Brzezinski, a similar pattern happened one day
                    with them. But there was some very, very capable and effective bureaucratic
                    warriors, to use that term, within the State Department at that time, not only
                    State Department but also Defense and they were able to assert their own
                    institutional views. I'm thinking of people like U. Alexis Johnson and Joe Sisco
                    and David Newsom and others at that time, who didn't roll over for this but it
                    made it difficult if Rogers wasn't the kind of person who would go into the
                    president personally every day and pound his fists on the table and say, “Your
                    man Kissinger's getting out of line, here.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, also, I've talked to people who worked with Rogers
                        and he comes across as somebody who was not overly engaged in many of the
                        issues.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: That could also be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fairly relaxed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Very relaxed, yeah, that's probably right and not looking for
                    fights.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your particular piece of the action, when you got
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I was asked to join a planning cell that had initially been headed up by
                    Bob Osgood but as Bob went back to SAIS that role was taken over, more or less,
                    by Al Haig and Dick Kennedy, two very accomplished military officers who became
                    kind of the key inside apparat, I guess you'd call it, for Kissinger on the NSC
                    staff. I've written extensively about the Kissinger NSC staff system, so I'll
                    bore you if you keep asking me questions about this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you can bore me because, in a way, this is for a
                        different medium, so I don't mind repetition on this.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>CROCKER: But it was a kind of, it was called the Planning and Coordination Group
                    or something like that, very bureaucratic sounding but what it really was was a
                    kind of staff that intercepted everybody else's paper coming into Kissinger. So,
                    in other words, if the Southeast Asia people had a memo or the European MBFR
                    talks were going and they had a memo that was going to Kissinger, it went
                    through Haig and Kennedy, Kennedy and Haig and I was working for Kennedy. I was
                    working along with a then hot shot colonel named Bernard Lefky. I was working
                    alongside a fellow named John Glancy, another fellow by the name of John
                    Negroponte. There were four or five of us in that office, working for Kennedy
                    and Haig and it was across the board. So I would be asked to do things on, let's
                    say, arms supplies to the Middle East or implications of British withdrawal from
                    east of Suez or military assistance policies or having another look it what's
                    going to happen with the dry season offensive in Laos or what's going on in
                    Africa and the Indian Ocean. My background was very much sort of Middle East,
                    Africa, Indian Ocean geographically, so I naturally gravitated to them but I
                    wasn't geographically assigned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talk about these security memorandum.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Memoranda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's all very good but a piece of paper but what, was it a
                        feeling that if something went through the system, something happened? In
                        other words, were these more just interesting or there's a lot of action
                        that came from this process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I think it varied. I think in some case they were ways of keeping the
                    bureaucracy busy by studying issues and analyzing issues and coming up with
                    predictable bureaucratic compromises and fudges over the way things were going.
                    But in other cases they sorted out and they provided a kind of basis for
                    establishing what the, if you like the policy or the ideological framework was
                    for a subject. In some cases there was really a need for decisions, because you
                    were talking about the military assistance budget or how much should be spent on
                    civil defense. I spent about three quarters of a year on a massive interagency
                    project on civil defense planning. Not a very high profile, sexy issue, but a
                    very important issue. Either to bury it or to resuscitate it or do something
                    with it but it was driven by budget issues and how much are we going to
                    fund.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One has heard, in sort of comparable time, I mean in a
                        decade, that the Chinese were going underground, the Soviets were supposed
                        to have built up a huge subterranean system and all that. In the long run,
                        what were we doing on this sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, not very much, as it turned out and what we were doing was always,
                    as it is in our federal system, very indirect. We were seeding money for states
                    to pickup on. We were trying to create some common doctrines but with fifty
                    different states it makes it rather difficult to be doing it at the national
                    level. But there were areas of spending that one could focus on and there were
                    also questions of strategic intent and whether you spend money on these things
                    and it becomes known publicly, as it will, that that's what you're doing you're
                    sending a signal. If you have no civil defense it means you're holding your
                    population as kind of a hostage. If you have a lot of civil defense, it means
                    maybe you're thinking about a first strike strategy. So all those questions were
                    thrashed around a lot as it related to a nuclear strategy.</p>
                <p>Something else we would do periodically is dust off the contingency plans for
                    potential U.S. military involvement in different parts of the world, depending
                    on events. What happens if so and so is overthrown? What do we do if Chinese and
                    the Soviets go to war over their tensions on the Ussuri River, another kind of
                    live contingency that came up at the time.</p>
                <p>I think the NSC management saw it as in the interests of the White House to get a
                    little bit of control over the way the Defense Department was thinking about
                    contingencies and to drive the process of thinking forward. I think some of
                    these decision papers were quite real. Quite often what we on the staff would do
                    would be to write parallel analyses of what was going on in the formal
                    bureaucratic process. So there'd be an interagency paper and then we as junior
                    staff and I was pretty young at the time, would be asked for another view and we
                    would attach our view to the interagency paper and we'd send them both forward
                    and Haig and Kissinger would do with them what they would. So that was the
                    nature of the experience.</p>
                <p>It was obviously exciting and interesting work. It was also, in the heat of the
                    action there were some very dramatic times. There were also some times of great
                    amusement, as we helped the staff to write the series of Nixon's foreign policy
                    reports that were sent to the Congress each year, quite a comprehensive effort
                    to sum up American foreign policy, as we now do with the so-called National
                    Security Strategy Memoranda, which are only every four years. Back then we were
                    doing it every years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought, particularly at that time, you had
                        two people who were extremely competent in foreign affairs, the president
                        and national security advisor, which is not always the case. Did you feel
                        the hand of Nixon, at your level, did it sort of penetrate down, “No, no,
                        no, let's try this” or that or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>CROCKER: We did. We'd see memos that would come back, memos that had gone from
                    Henry to the president that would come back with the president's marginal
                    comment. We would see those occasionally, when we were dealing with directly
                    operational paper: should we or shouldn't we receive the Portuguese leader who's
                    coming to town for a lengthy discussion of the Azores and southern Africa, for
                    example. So we would see those kinds of marginal comments and have a sense of
                    the president's gut instinct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a feeling, we were still, at that point,
                        involved in Vietnam, that military intervention elsewhere, unless it were a
                        small island problem or something, just was out of the question?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: There was no question, this period that we're talking about, both of
                    Nixon's terms in fact were as heavily influenced by Vietnam as today's
                    president, Bush 43, is influenced by Iraq. You can't gainsay it. It's there. It
                    was on the evening news every single night. We had a policy then, the so-called
                    Nixon Doctrine, of trying to Vietnamize the war. Eventually, even after
                    impeachment and Watergate and all the rest, the administration of Jerry Ford
                    lost control of Congress on the Vietnam issue and Congress undercut Kissinger's
                    ability to do what he would otherwise have done, probably.</p>
                <p>The North Vietnamese read us like a book. They knew that we could be defeated at
                    home, we didn't need to be defeated on the battlefield. That's the way they read
                    us.</p>
                <p>I think this overwhelmed a lot of things. It made it more difficult, for example,
                    for us to deal with the Soviets with the strength we might otherwise have been
                    able to on strategic arms or on their activity in other parts of the world. It
                    made us somewhat more vulnerable.</p>
                <p>It obviously created the framework and the environment in which we had an opening
                    to China, which was an opening that we needed more than the Chinese did,
                    arguably and was considered a great breakthrough, a great success but it was
                    also one that we needed.</p>
                <p>So when you read Kissinger's memoirs it becomes very clear that he felt he was
                    dealing, as the advisor to the most powerful man in the world, as a person who
                    had one hand tied behind his back. That's what Vietnam did to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you got to the NSC, how did you and maybe your
                        junior colleagues view the Soviet Union? Was this a power on the move? How
                        was the Cold War viewed at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>CROCKER: Interesting question. I would say that I believed then (and still
                    believe now), that the Soviet Union was an ossified and even criminalized
                    dictatorship of a small elite that was very conservative but also very, very
                    determined. And it was interesting to watch as we tried to talk to them about
                    different problems around the world but mainly about arms control and about
                    Vietnam, you got a sense that they were reading us very carefully, reading our
                    domestic politics very carefully, reading Vietnam very carefully. We saw them as
                    a genuinely global adversary that would take advantage of vacuums, would fill
                    vacuums if vacuums were created and would look for cheap opportunities to
                    exploit vacuums.</p>
                <p>The classic case in my experience and one that I worked on a lot subsequently of
                    course was central and southern Africa, where the end of European staying power
                    created a transition and the issue was would that transition be filled by
                    African leadership or would it be filled by something else. In most cases, until
                    the mid-Seventies, it was filled by African leadership and by residual European
                    roles, as we were talking about and to some extent by the U.S. in the Congo, in
                    that central part of Africa.</p>
                <p>But '74, '75, with the Portuguese revolution, that all changed. The Portuguese
                    just collapsed. They literally collapsed and they left behind an utter shambles.
                    It was a worse shambles than the Belgians left behind in the Congo.</p>
                <p>If you look at southern and central Africa as a kind of strategic balance sheet
                    this is not insignificant and the concern of many of us was that the Soviets
                    with their friends would seek to take advantage of this and change the entire
                    chemistry of that region in a way that was not only hostile to our interests but
                    hostile to the natural development of that region.</p>
                <p>So, yes, I did see them as a global adversary, but a global adversary that was
                    taking advantage of various conflicts and local issues. It wasn't that they were
                    inventing conflicts. They were exploiting conflict.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did you see them as a staying power? There seem to
                        have been certain things within the Russian psyche or something that don't
                        make a very good colonialist or permit them to work in a foreign
                        environment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I think I know what you're getting at. It's hard to know to what extent
                    one is imposing views based on hindsight but I'm sure that we knew enough by
                    then to know that the Africans experienced a lot of racism and that the Russians
                    weren't great at cross-cultural communications with Arabs and Africans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lumumba University was not a great success.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>CROCKER: It wasn't a brilliant success, no. I think that's right.</p>
                <p>But it wasn't necessarily a question of them wanting to hold territory but rather
                    to helpcreate weak and dependent proxy governments that would deny access to
                    Western nations, including us, of course. By access I mean overflight, I mean
                    staging, I mean port visits and I also mean investments and trade in raw
                    materials. We're talking about energy, in the case of the Persian Gulf, which is
                    one that I watched and worked on a lot, especially after the British decision to
                    pull down the flag east of Suez. That was 1971, when I was on the NSC staff.</p>
                <p>And then in '74-'75 in central and southern Africa, where the issue was not so
                    much energy as non-fuel minerals, there were some who also argued that the Cape
                    sea route was somehow a great strategic prize which the Soviets were determined
                    to seize from Western naval power. I never took that very seriously but there
                    were people who did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is a little hard, but, again, in hindsight, to think,
                        what are they going to do? Are they going to have frigates stationed off the
                        Cape of Good Hope or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: The argument would be that if the Suez Canal is closed by hostile
                    Arab/Soviet power, then the routes that bring tankers and other things from the
                    Gulf to Europe could be either interrupted or attacked, you could have raids on
                    commerce on the high seas and if you had friendlies ashore in places like
                    Mozambique, the Mozambique Channel is a bit of a choke point, then that might be
                    awkward. And even more so if there were friendlies ashore in South Africa, where
                    you have really rough weather down there, you sometimes need help to get around
                    that cape.</p>
                <p>That's the argument. As I say, I didn't ever buy it, because it struck me that
                    this would expose the Soviet Navy to countermeasures that they would not be able
                    to cope with. I didn't think the Soviet naval balance was such that they could
                    take that risk so far away from their home bases. They were building a blue
                    water navy, but they hadn't built it yet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to go back to one thing you were saying, when you
                        were working on civil defense, as we know today, with the Department of
                        Homeland Security, this is probably more a domestic political issue than
                        almost anything else, allocation of funds. How did you all approach this,
                        state by state? Were you getting political input, you have to make sure
                        Wyoming gets its share and that sort of thing?</hi>

                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>CROCKER: We didn't get that down into the weeds, because we were dealing more
                    with questions of doctrine and broad spending authority for different categories
                    of spending. As I recall, it's been a long time now, this was highly classified
                    stuff, but as I recall we weren't talking about large numbers of funds to be
                    transferred to the states. It was more a question of encouraging states to
                    either build or not build, using their own money and it was a question of
                    deciding what level of preparations we should be seen undertaking, because of
                    strategic signaling that we're doing, on the SALT talks and things like that.
                    So, did we want to be sending a message to the other side, namely the Soviets?
                    We were talking more about the Soviets than we were about Congress or
                    Wyoming.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The various arms limitation talks, how optimistic were you
                        all? Was this going to be a viable thing or was this a period of marking
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I wasn't involved directly in the arms control talks, so I'm not well
                    placed to comment. I guess my sense was that many of us who were more junior
                    thought that Kissinger was fairly brilliant in the way he managed to negotiate
                    us into a series of discussions with the Soviets and obviously the president led
                    the way on this. That gave us a decent shot at doing something to limit the
                    strategic competition in our interest, at a time when we had one hand tied
                    behind our backs and we were obviously on the defensive. They were building
                    without much evident constraint. We did face constraints. We faced guns and
                    butter constraints. We faced war constraints. So I thought it was an impressive
                    effort, but I watched it from a distance. I wasn't directly involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How'd you view Alexander Haig as a taskmaster?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well I got to know him pretty well from that experience and to see him
                    in action often enough to know that he had a kind of locker room style of
                    bureaucratic procedure. He was quite capable of speaking his mind and being very
                    blunt. I think when Kissinger blew a gasket and Kissinger was known on occasion
                    to lose his temper at his own staff, Haig's own instincts in that regard were
                    probably influenced as well and he became somebody who would growl and erupt and
                    not throw things at you but he got red in the face and that in turn led his
                    underlings to yell. So we spent some long hours redoing memos and stuff when
                    they didn't quite come up to snuff.</p>
                <p>It was a very top down, centralized system. It was run by, a lot of skilled
                    military officers were running this inside staff that I mentioned, but the
                    overall atmosphere was on the whole collegial and we had some good colleagues
                    there, some outstanding people worked on that staff and many of them became
                    lifelong friends of mine. People like Peter Rodman, John Negroponte, and Hal
                    Saunders, really good people.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: He was the coordinator of all coordinators and he made sure that things
                    got internally cleared the way they were supposed to be. He also made sure that
                    paper was intercepted if it hadn't been cleared properly. So he wasn't always
                    very popular. He was seen as the consummate bureaucratic turf manager, if you
                    like, for Haig and then of course for Kissinger. He played a fairly assertive
                    game as well as within the staff. And he had some areas of his own expertise
                    that he was quite accomplished in and particularly when it came to issues of
                    nuclear enrichment and nuclear proliferation.</p>

                        you were a junior master of the universe, you and your colleagues, that you
                        really were at the heart of the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, we knew we were at the heart of the government. There wasn't any
                    doubt in our minds. All we had to do was view Marvin Kalb's pieces or read
                    Murray Marder or Bernie Gwertzman or whoever it was was writing back then. We
                    would just have to read their stuff to realize that Kissinger had figured out a
                    way to become himself a kind of master of the foreign policy process. I think we
                    saw some of the occasional downsides of a centralized approach, but the downside
                    of a non-centralized or incoherent approach always stuck in my mind as well. I
                    look back, sometimes fondly, from when I was in the Reagan Administration at the
                    relative coherence of the Nixon approach, 'cause you had a president who was
                    engaged, you had a president who knew the brief, a president who would work
                    closely with a high powered NSC advisor. You compare that with Reagan, who
                    tolerated a kind of open warfare between his cabinet secretaries and departments
                    that I don't think Nixon would ever have tolerated for a minute.</p>
                <p>I look back wringing my hands in despair, sometimes, about the lack of coherence,
                    the lack of discipline, the lack of an NSC system that works. We saw in the
                    Reagan period and we're getting ahead of ourselves here, time after time the NSC
                    system simply collapsed, it didn't work. There was no imposed discipline on the
                    players. My then boss George Shultz used to remark that when something gets
                    decided in Washington it gets undecided five minutes later. That didn't happen
                    with the Nixon-Kissinger apparat. Whether you liked it or not, that didn't
                    happen then.</p>

                <p>CROCKER The NSC was checking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was part of your brief?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: That was part of our brief. We would actually read the cable traffic to
                    see if the agencies were loyally carrying out the president's policy and if they
                    weren't, dammit, we're going to do something about it and we would call up a
                    desk officer or call up a country director and say, “About this incoming cable
                    from Ambassador Zilch out here in Tananarivo, does he realize what president
                    he's working for?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in the perpetual fight between
                        particularly the Defense Department and the State Department, or was this
                        sort of I take it kept under control, or did the count?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Oh, they counted and that tension is always going to be there on areas
                    that bring them into direct touch with each other. I think it's gotten
                    completely out of hand today. Back then there was a greater degree of balance.
                    Our ambassadors still had the authority in the field that they should have and
                    you didn't have the Defense Department running around conducting intelligence
                    policy and covert operations and the State Department and everyone else doing
                    public diplomacy and everything else that you have now. But there were areas of
                    tension. There were areas where you'd see a natural division of interest.</p>
                <p>For example, to think of a case that would illustrate what I'm talking about,
                    there was a policy review of what should be the future of our Persian Gulf
                    fleet, which was tiny, back then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: COMMIDEASTFOR. The Greenwich Bay, a seaplane tender. I was
                        in Dhahran earlier on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: So you know better than I what it was. It was one sort of stationary
                    ship and a couple of mobile ships.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>So the issue was, now that Harold Wilson has decided what he had decided in terms
                    of the future of Her Majesty's forces east of Suez, running them down to the
                    point that there was very little left. They had the RAF at Masirah and Sharjah
                    and you had Diego Garcia and you had a little bit of a presence, still, in Oman
                    and Malaysia. But the Brits were leaving. They were leaving Aden. How big should
                    MIDEASTFOR become? What should we do with Bahrain? How forward leaning should we
                    be in asking for additional port visits, provision of rights to have ships
                    stationed out there and get shore leave for our sailors and so on?</p>
                <p>I think our view was more one that was closer to State's, probably, of trying to
                    keep the British engaged and doing things that would be inclined to encourage
                    them to stay engaged as best we could, as a source of training and advice and
                    arms support and so on for Oman and other countries. Perhaps the navy was a
                    little bit more inclined to see if we couldn't just sort of fill the British
                    shoes and displace them. After all, they were leaving, so why not just go in
                    there? We were a little more concerned about the sensibilities of the Arab
                    states in the region, who may not have wanted to have such a visible U.S. naval
                    presence. They may have wanted them more over the horizon and they still do,
                    sometimes. So I think State and Defense have a natural, let's call it a dialogue
                    over these kinds of issues and they're bound to see it a little bit based on
                    their own relative priority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Something that's always bothered me about the NSC,
                        particularly when they recruit from outside, when you're dealing with the
                        Persian Gulf, the State Department has people who for the most part, who are
                        dealing with it, have served in the Persian Gulf. They know the
                        personalities, they know the geography and all and someone who comes in who
                        may have a great academic background or have read a lot about it or just be
                        a Washington operator and yet, there isn't that sort of feet on the ground
                        experience, when you're working in the NSC. Did you feel that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: The NSC then was composed of people who were seconded over from the
                    military, from State and from the Agency, as well as outside hires like myself
                    who were from the academic world or think tanks who'd come in with Henry. People
                    like Peter Rodman, for example. But if you look around the composition of the
                    Kissinger staff, you will see quite a diverse range of people from different
                    backgrounds, some of them from State. I think what's unique about the NSC is the
                    complexity of the environment. When it's doing its job right, it is supposed to
                    reflect up to the president a range of interagency views, not just the views of
                    one agency. And secondly it's supposed to protect the interests of the White
                    House and the president, as distinguished from the interests of cabinet
                    secretaries, who may have different interests and different bureaucratic
                    pressures, different institutional agendas, different congressional
                    relationships and so on.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>And you have to have a head for policy, you have to have an interest in policy
                    and maybe even in strategy if you wanted to be effective in the NSC. I would
                    argue to you that some people from the State Department have that interest and
                    some people don't and the same is true for people from Defense. Some people from
                    Defense are more interested in budgets and hardware and toys. They're not so
                    interested, really, in high policy.</p>
                <p>We were interested in high policy and how the pieces fit together in a strategic
                    sense. That's the way I like to think we saw it.</p>
                <p>The typical complaint that we would hear, that I would hear from colleagues about
                    the State Department was, “All they're interested in is good relations with
                    their client.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's a lot of validity to that. I speak as a consular
                        officer who often was trying to get somebody out of jail and the ambassador
                        would think, “I hate to go to the emir to talk about some guy who's in
                        jail.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: You're spending your capital.</p>
                <p>It is a clich� and it's a clich� that has a basis, which is that some time the
                    sum total of State Department input into a policy document is “our interest is
                    in having improved relations with the president of X,” you fill in the blank. It
                    could be Gabon or it could be Saudi Arabia or it could be whatever. I've always
                    been very scathing about that, because frankly I'm not interested in good
                    relations as an end in itself. I'm interested in effective advancement of
                    American national interests, which is a different thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely. Was there an ability to develop a world view,
                        or was Kissinger sort of laying down an outline of where we want to go and
                        how we want to do this, or were you very much absorbed in the details and
                        not seeing where it fit into that world view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I think it was a mixture. There were times when I was down in the weeds
                    pretty deep, I'm sure, at that time, being fairly junior on that staff. I was
                    about to be promoted on the staff when I decided to accept an offer to come to
                    Georgetown. You get into particular sets of issues and meetings and writing
                    tasks and deadlines and it does tend to narrow your perspective, but if I had an
                    overview it was a realpolitik overview and it's one that I felt more and more
                    comfortable with going forward, a Kissingerian sense of realpolitik. I'm an
                    unabashed realist and have stayed that way ever since and debates today over
                    whether the Iraq War was a good idea or not, I'm thoroughly in the camp of Brent
                    Scowcroft, who is thoroughly in the camp of what I'm talking about, which is a
                    camp that understands the notion of limits and understands that there's upside
                    as well as downside to being Wilsonian in our foreign policy. We are inevitably
                    going to be somewhat Wilsonian because of who we are.</p>

                    internationalism, the notion of democratic peace, the notion that it is our job
                    in the world to start every day by figuring out what sermon we will deliver to
                    the rest of mankind, because after all, we are a city on a hill. All you have to
                    do is go to the noon briefing at the State Department. Just the tone of it, it
                    doesn't matter whether it's Democrats or Republicans, the tone of it implies
                    that basically we sit in judgment upon mankind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We institutionalize it for example with things like human
                        rights and other things of this nature.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Were there any particular issues, during this two years you were at the NSC, that
                    really come to mind, or personalities you got involved in, to give a feel for
                    the operation during that time?</p>
                <p>CROCKER: I have very vivid memories of a few of them, people like Marshall
                    Wright, whom I worked with on some African issues, a very strong personality
                    from whom I learned a lot about advocacy and about writing and things like that.
                    Marshall was an able person. I'm still in touch with him a little bit from time
                    to time.</p>
                <p>Hal Saunders I learned a lot from and have an abiding respect for. A very
                    interesting fellow and he had some people working for him whom I stayed in touch
                    over the years. Win Lord and Peter Rodman, working as the gurus who would try to
                    figure out how to make Kissinger humorous when he got in front of the camera or
                    how to write good speeches for him or how to take the first whack at policy
                    review papers that he was mulling over..</p>
                <p>So there was a range of interesting characters there. I don't know if this is
                    very common, but to this day there are from time to time reunions of the
                    Kissinger NSC staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was a special time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: You had people like Bob Hormats, for example, who's now the vice
                    chairman of Goldman Sachs and Dick Solomon who now heads up the U.S. Institute
                    of Peace where I was chairman for 12 years, and so on. Some very interesting
                    personalities that one wants to stay in touch with, because they were good
                    friends and worthwhile people. People who've gone on to do interesting things
                    with their lives.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>Pete Vaky was another person I should mention, 'cause I worked a little bit on
                    some Latin American issues under his guidance. And then he came up to
                    Georgetown, after he took leave from the NSC. I think he was diplomat in
                    residence. And the then dean of the Georgetown School of Foreign Service, Peter
                    Krogh, asked Pete Vaky, I'm talking about Viron P. Vaky to have a look at our
                    masters degree curriculum and Pete led an interdepartmental review up here at
                    Georgetown and came up with some proposals for a new MSFS program. And then Pete
                    came back to me on the NSC staff where'd he been and basically pitched me on
                    coming up to run it.</p>
                <p>So that's how that transition occurred. It occurred, Peter Krogh and Pete Vaky
                    together approaching me and making me an offer which was attractive in academic
                    terms and was something that I knew I wanted to do at some point. When I
                    mentioned this internally on the staff there was a sense of shock. “Why? You're
                    doing well here and we're going to bump you up one notch bureaucratically and
                    give you some additional things to do. Why would you leave?”</p>
                <p>I had a sense that maybe I'd experienced what I was going to experience for the
                    time being and it was time for me to get back to the world that I had always
                    intended to have as part of my life, which was the academic world. I didn't want
                    to miss my chance to take an interesting position at a major Washington
                    university, and the new initiatives being developed at the School were very
                    attractive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the product or the input of the CIA at
                        that time? What role would you say they played?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: They tied us up in knots with all the paper they produced. Kissinger
                    used to refer to them, in his guttural accent, as “those Talmudic scholars.” Of
                    course he was talking about the analysts. He wasn't talking about the operators.
                    Things were very compartmented between the two sides of the house back then, as
                    they still are.</p>
                <p>There were a number of people who came from Agency backgrounds, typically from
                    the analytical side, but not always, on the staff. I found them interesting to
                    work with but I did have a sense that maybe some of them needed to spend a
                    little more time in the field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is one of the criticisms or comments that I
                        get from people who talk about the difference between CIA and Intelligence
                        and Research at the State Department, that State Department's INR is smaller
                        and usually is closer to the policy people, so it's a little more action
                        oriented, as opposed to a more Talmudic approach.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>CROCKER: I think it's hard probably to generalize but in an ivory tower you're
                    not allowed to come out into daylight very often. Back then you couldn't go to
                    meetings that easily and you couldn't travel that easily, so it was hard, I
                    think, for Agency people on the analytical side to be as in touch as they would
                    often have liked to be. That's of course changed over the years since then,
                    we're talking 35 years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Often I've gotten the reverse, people who've said they're
                        in the academic world but they wanted to get where the action was. Obviously
                        you were where the action was. Was this an offer you couldn't refuse?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Looking back on it, it's interesting and it's not the only time in my
                    career that I've turned my back on the government and declined to take an
                    opportunity. I guess deep down I'm a bit of a rebel, maybe, and I just don't
                    like being dependent or having a feeling that I need to always consistently do
                    what the bureaucracy would expect. Plus it was a very attractive opportunity.
                    Not financially, heaven knows, but then nothing was attractive financially back
                    in those days, either in government or in academe.</p>
                <p>But in terms of career possibilities, this was a position that had the
                    possibility of becoming a tenure track professorial position, a joint academic
                    and administrative assignment to really build a graduate program up to a leading
                    position among front rank International Relations programs. What had existed
                    before was an 18-month, off-the-shelf masters, a stepchild of the social science
                    departments. It had some good people, good faculty and good students, but it
                    wasn't a full time program, free standing program with its own dedicated status
                    and identity. It had no full time administration. It had no recruitment program,
                    it had no placement program, it had no internship program and it didn't really
                    have its own real curriculum tailored for professionally-oriented students. It
                    had a scotch-taped curriculum.</p>
                <p>What Vaky and others designed, which I developed further, was a full fledged
                    curriculum with a specific mandate to train future professionals in the
                    international relations field, both public and private and to do so knowing that
                    the competition we were going to go head to head with was Fletcher and SAIS and
                    Columbia and Princeton. We weren't going to mess around. So we had to really
                    build up our recruitment program and get ourselves on the map and become better
                    known and do a lot more for our students and with our students than had been
                    done previously.</p>
                <p>I saw that as an interesting institution building challenge and a rather exciting
                    one. But I also saw it as a chance to write and to do something I hadn't been
                    able to do before, which was to document through some sort of scholarly articles
                    some of what I'd experienced and also some of my PhD work, 'cause I'd never
                    published my PhD, either. So it was at Georgetown when I came back that I had
                    the time and the ability to write a few articles that were in refereed journals,
                    that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about '72, when you're coming back to
                        Georgetown. To get a feel for sort of the academic administrative
                        environment, first place, are you breaking people's rice bowls, when you set
                        up, one always hears about academic wars being very vicious and all that?
                        Were there problems in setting up a program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, it's a good question. Of course there are problems because there's
                    lots of politics in academe. But I was fortunate, I was recruited to come to the
                    School of Foreign Service to be the first fulltime director of its graduate
                    program, which is called the Master of Science in Foreign Service program, MSFS
                    for short, which had just been reviewed and assessed by a very impressive bunch
                    of faculty and outsiders.</p>
                <p>That exercise had been led by the new dean of the school, Peter Krogh, who had
                    come to Georgetown two years previously and a visiting diplomat in residence by
                    the name of Viron, otherwise known as Pete, Vaky. The goal was to create what
                    you might call a professionally oriented, full time, four semester program of
                    graduate study, which was aimed at being a terminal degree, not in the sense
                    that it was life-threatening (!) but that it was meant for non-academic
                    careers.</p>
                <p>So it was a four semester interdisciplinary masters, which is a more demanding
                    course of study in some ways than the kind of 'stepping stone' masters that
                    people do if they're going on to get a PhD in history or something like that.
                    It's got different requirements.</p>
                <p>So I inherited this review process and was the first full time director. I was
                    blessed that I had Pete coming ahead of me, I had Peter Krogh as dean, supplied
                    a lot of air cover, made it somewhat simpler to work with some of the key
                    departments that contained the faculty resources that we would need to run this
                    program. And I had a good faculty committee and I worked to strengthen it as a
                    dedicated curricular and institutional planning group and we met frequently to
                    talk about how the new program was going. So I guess I had the wind at my
                    back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Peter Krogh, I've heard from my colleagues in the Foreign
                        Service, he was known as an operator, really knew how to get money, get
                        things. This is often an extremely valuable ability.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>CROCKER: No question about it. He still has that ability. He's a great people
                    person. He knows how to shake the tree when it comes to fund raising. He was
                    good at that, but he also was, more importantly, I think, a conceptualizer, an
                    entrepreneur in the best sense, who had ideas and saw possibilities and created
                    opportunities. Not every one of his ideas was always a winner but a very high
                    percentage, he had a heck of a batting average. And he was dean here for some 25
                    years. He's now dean emeritus and he's still teaching here. But I worked with
                    him throughout the period I was MSFS program director and I came in as assistant
                    professor and, thanks to some good fortune, I managed to get myself into the
                    tenure system and I got bumped up to associate professor before I joined the
                    State Department in 1981. So that was about eight, eight and a half years of my
                    life and it was a very interesting period, lot of challenges, a lot of retail
                    time spent advising students, their careers, advising students on what courses
                    to take, which faculty to avoid, which faculty to run for or run from, doing a
                    lot of work on things like admissions and outreach and alumni relations and
                    curriculum development, all these different parts of the job of running a
                    graduate program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These masters students, who did you see them as
                        being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: It's interesting that you ask that. The School of Foreign Service had
                    the name before the U.S. Foreign Service had the name “foreign service.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1924, we got it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: We got it in 1919, when the School of Foreign Service was created by
                    Father Edmund Walsh. He always meant by that term service in the broadest sense,
                    in various internationally-oriented careers. Today it's a different situation.
                    Today the program is forty per cent, 35-40 per cent, foreign students. Back in
                    the 1970s when I ran it, the program was probably more like 15 or 20 %
                    international students.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you, given your background and interests, tuck away in
                        your mind you wanted to get African representation, to train Africans in
                        foreign service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes and we had a few from time to time. Money factors were always
                    central in that regard, but we had a few and we reached out when we could. We're
                    doing a lot better today than we did back then, but, sure, I would always have a
                    particular soft spot if I saw a great application coming in from Africa, I would
                    try to figure out how we could make this work.</p>
                <p>At the same time I was doing that, I was also becoming a research scholar. So I
                    had to do my own teaching, I had to do my own writing and research and try to
                    get qualified for tenure. So that was a dual responsibility.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What fields were you researching in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I did work in several fields, some relating to my doctoral work. Writing
                    on the African military and military development, the emergence of African
                    military institutions, security relations between major Western powers, major
                    communist powers and African countries, the role of the U.S. in African conflict
                    issues, which is of course still an interest of mine today. So that was one set
                    of interests.</p>
                <p>Another, which came directly out of my experience in the NSC, was the way the
                    foreign policy process works and what it means to have a coherent foreign
                    policy. We used to joke that</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not quite sure what you mean.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Right, exactly. We liked to think during the heyday of the
                    Nixon-Kissinger period, before Watergate and so forth, that this really was
                    coherence, that the NSC system as designed by Kissinger and Nixon was not only a
                    conspiracy to control power in the White House and to marginalize other actors
                    but it was actually a coherent way to make foreign policy and sometimes we made
                    good foreign policy as a result. Now people used to joke that the real
                    practitioner of coherent foreign policy was Genghis Khan. But leaving that
                    aside, I wrote a fair amount about issues of foreign policy management and
                    bureaucratic politics. I did some work with the Murphy Commission on the
                    organization of the government for foreign policy, which was interesting. So
                    those were two areas I worked in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that you had counseled students who were
                        coming into the masters program, what courses to take, what courses to
                        avoid. I have to state my prejudice, over the years and people I've
                        interviewed, including a man I was interviewing yesterday, who was
                        ambassador to Malaysia, Asian hand, basically a Japanese expert, he was
                        talking about he majored at Northwestern in the Sixties in political science
                        and found it almost useless, it was very quantitative, even in the early
                        days. I'd like your take on political science, which seems to have turned
                        into, I won't call it a pseudoscience but a science of quantitative
                        measurements of things and all that. How did you find this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>CROCKER: One does not come to Georgetown University to do quantitative political
                    science, let me start there. Georgetown's political science department, which is
                    called the government department, very consciously and that has not changed, I
                    doubt if it will, is not a quantitatively oriented place. It is a qualitatively
                    oriented place that does a lot of work that you might call normative or
                    theoretical. As you know, the field of political science has four subfields, as
                    a rule, in most departments: American government, political theory, comparative
                    politics and international relations. The MSFSprogram that I was involved with
                    would draw mostly from comparative politics and international relations but in
                    neither case did we have a lot of emphasis on pure quantitative political
                    science.</p>
                <p>We did have some emphasis on what I'd call theoretical international relations,
                    the Theory and Practice of International Relations is the title of one of our
                    courses. That meant that you're looking at different paradigms of how you think
                    about the way power is distributed and should be distributed in the
                    international system. Are you a realist or neorealist, are you a liberal or a
                    neo-liberal or a functionalist, are you a constructivist, in today's
                    terminology, or neo-Marxian, which is another paradigm, of course. So we thought
                    it was important and we still do that students be very sensitive to and aware of
                    the basic assumptions you take into a review of what's going on in the world,
                    that at least you have a critical self-awareness of what your assumptions are —
                    for example about what causes war, what causes conflict.</p>
                <p>I spent six years teaching a course during the Seventies called The Use of Force
                    in Foreign Policy. We started out by trying to understand where does war come
                    from, what are the origins of war? Is it innate, is it learned behavior or is it
                    innate genetic behavior? Is it based on misperception? Is it based on structural
                    relationships between countries and security dilemmas? Is it based on arms
                    races? What causes war?</p>
                <p>It was important (and still is) for people entering the international field to be
                    very sensitive to these conceptual frameworks. It doesn't meant it has to be
                    quantitative conceptual frameworks and my sense of it, what you can measure
                    quantitatively may or may not be interesting in conceptual terms. Sometimes
                    what's most easily measured is least relevant. So that's my view of quantitative
                    political science and we don't have a lot of it here at Georgetown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's just that, looking at the field, one of the things
                        I've been struck with is how little connect there is in talking to people
                        who've been involved as worker bees in the foreign policy apparatus, how
                        little contact or interest there is in what's being written about it and
                        certainly at the political science level, those ones which are quantitative,
                        it's almost completely dismissed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: There is, however, I think some interesting work that can be done to
                    either debunk or to validate common theories that we walk around with, that we
                    may have learned at our grandmother's knee or whatever.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or other low joints, as Dean Acheson used to say.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes, right, exactly. So, for example, I saw some research recently that
                    was in this field, using highly quantitative statistical manipulations to try to
                    understand why is it that in the post-1945 period more and more wars are ending
                    in a tie, ending in a draw or a truce, rather than ending in a victory for one
                    side. One can try to explain that in lots of ways and some of those ways, given
                    the databases that political scientists have assembled, some of those ways can
                    be empirically tested. They can be tested statistically. Some of them are much
                    harder to test that way. But at least it's an interesting exercise to try to
                    figure out what are the correlations or what are the factors that might explain
                    the growing number of ties or draws. Now, I'm not trying to sell you
                    quantitative political science. What I'm saying is that some of it is more
                    relevant than others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I completely buy that. The fact that somebody would take a
                        look at this and say, “Hey, wait a minute, we notice that you're not having
                        lots of victors and defeated, but you're having a lot of people sort of
                        ending up in a tie and then having to live with themselves.” Bosnia,

                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Lots of cases like that. One of the answers one might come to is that
                    there's more balancing going on, or that the relationships between parties are
                    more equalized or that maybe today's wars are between weaker entities and they
                    can't fight for so long.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know when I was in Athens in the Seventies and there was
                        the usual flare-up between Greece and Turkey and our military attach� said,
                        “On both sides, they can probably fight for about six days and then they'll
                        run out of ammunition.”</hi>

                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>CROCKER: Georgetown is a place very close to power. It's always been very close
                    to power because of its location. People like to joke about Georgetown, that 'it
                    was founded by the Society of Jesus on a bluff overlooking the Potomac and has
                    been run that way ever since!'. We don't, in fact, overlook the Potomac. We are
                    very close to the Potomac.</p>
                <p>I think that my own views were very shaped by the kind of scholars I worked with
                    and the kind of public servants that I worked with, in that era. I thought that
                    we did have a global adversary and that global adversary was not only a
                    traditional geopolitical adversary, it had some really nasty qualities, too. It
                    was kind of a criminal enterprise, the Soviet Union. The Communist Party was a
                    highly corrupt criminal enterprise that fed like parasites off the people and
                    the resource base. The Soviet economy was the only economy ever known to man
                    that actually reduced the value when it manufactured something. It took natural
                    resources and reduced their value with the output of whatever it was, machine
                    tools or shoes or whatever, with only, the exception being, of course, the
                    military and aerospace, which was very advanced.</p>
                <p>But in any case, without overdoing the Evil Empire discourse, I did feel that
                    Soviet-U.S. rivalry was one that we had to prevail in and we had to prevail in
                    it in particular parts of the world. We had stabilized Europe. We'd made fools
                    of ourselves in Southeast Asia. The Soviets enjoyed watching us bleed in
                    Southeast Asia and they probably drew excessively bullish conclusions from that,
                    including that they could build themselves a world empire, a blue water navy and
                    expand to wherever we were in some way hamstrung. So to me the Middle East and
                    Africa were two areas where the U.S.-Soviet competition needed to be handled
                    with great skill and care and not necessarily in military terms but in
                    diplomatic terms, in many cases. So I felt that Brezhnev and his colleagues were
                    not really all that enlightened and didn't mean well, either for us or for our
                    friends in Africa and the Middle East.</p>
                <p>So that's the way I looked at it. I recognized the notion of a military
                    competition in these third areas was probably not the ideal way to play the game
                    and I also recognized that we'd have to get deeply involved in the politics of
                    those areas if we wanted to be effective in competing with them. We couldn't
                    just resort to platitudes and clich�s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With your masters program, you are on the Potomac, rather
                        than overlooking the Potomac, but obviously Washington, D.C. is rather a
                        small city, compares probably to Cleveland or something like that in size,
                        but it's loaded with both talent and experience. How it's played out is
                        another matter, but how did you draw on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>CROCKER: It's a good point. First of all, I had just come from government and a
                    number of others who were connected to this program had also had some experience
                    in government. Our dean, Peter Krogh, had created, shortly after I got here,
                    something called the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, which Martin Herz
                    helped to create and many distinguished people from the diplomatic career have
                    been there ever since, as visiting associates and what have you. So that was
                    kind of a window on academe for the Foreign Service as well as the Georgetown
                    University window on the world of diplomacy and it was a good interface there. A
                    number of associates that we would recruit would teach courses for our
                    undergraduate or graduate students. In addition, we had a little bit of what you
                    might call walking around money and we would supplement the course offerings of
                    the full time faculty by reaching out to adjunct faculty, which is a famous
                    tradition of Washington area universities.</p>
                <p>Adjunct faculty in fact sustain most of the universities in the Washington area
                    and some of the adjunct faculty you find available make a huge contribution,
                    because they bring the world of practice to the classroom and they can convey a
                    little bit before students actually get into the job market, a little bit about
                    what the job environment is like and what kinds of skills are required, in terms
                    of the way you think, the way you prepare, the way you brief, the way you speak,
                    the way you write, these kinds of things, which are very important. 45 page
                    footnoted term papers are not what gets you ahead in a career in government, so
                    thinking in that kind of operational way, it gave a kind of professional cast to
                    what we were doing. We would reach out as the need arose for coverage of
                    particular areas, both to think tank scholars and to visiting diplomats and
                    retired diplomats and intelligence officers and military, as well, to teach
                    certain courses.</p>
                <p>I'd say we took advantage of being in Washington, to answer your question. We'd
                    be crazy not to and of course it's great value, because what you pay an adjunct
                    professor is chump change, basically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time, we're talking about basically the
                        Seventies, how did you view developments in Africa during this period, from
                        on the bluff here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, it was a critical decade, in terms of two things: in terms of
                    Africa's emergence, after all this was really the second decade of Africa's
                    independence. Some of the territories and colonies in the southern part of
                    Africa were not yet under majority rule or independent, so the Seventies was the
                    penultimate decade of that struggle. You saw the wars over Rhodesia, now
                    Zimbabwe and the wars in the former Portuguese territories of Angola and
                    Mozambique and then the war that was getting started in the Seventies in
                    Namibia.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>So this was Africa's second decade of independence. There was a lot of, you might
                    call it turmoil, a lot of lessons being learned, a lot of political experiments
                    by different kinds of African leaders, a good deal of forum shopping by African
                    leaders to see where they got a better deal, in Europe or in the U.S. or with
                    Moscow and the Soviets' clients, or with the Chinese, for that matter.</p>
                <p>I like to equate Africa in the Seventies and Eighties to the environment of a
                    singles bar, where African countries would come to the bar and see what kind of
                    relationships were available. African leaders knew how to play the game and they
                    played it and we felt we knew how to play the game and we played it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, there was the thing, I think they call it today,
                        “hooking up.” This is a short-term relationship that comes out of a singles
                        bar. I think a lot of these countries were able to play the short-term
                        relationship card.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes and even when they weren't they often threatened to, so that
                    conversations with African leaders in the Seventies and Eighties were often
                    about what have you done for me lately and why did he get so much more than I
                    got and I look next door and I see the way the other side treats their friends.
                    A lot of that kind of behavior in client-patron relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at that time, as somebody who really cared about
                        the areas, where did you see sort of the bright spots and the dark
                        spots?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I'll come to that in a second, but I was saying that there were two
                    things in the Seventies that were very important. One was Africa's second decade
                    of independence and some of the unresolved issues that still had to be fought
                    out.</p>
                <p>The other was that this was a particular period of learning, and of competition
                    and confrontation between the U.S. and our global adversaries. So the Seventies
                    were the time, obviously, of Cambodia, of Vietnam, of the Horn of Africa (the
                    Ogaden wars), the Cuban intervention in Angola, the overthrow of the Shah, the
                    Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. And all of this shaped very much the way folks
                    like me though about the U.S. role in the world and what we should or shouldn't
                    be doing. This was the incubator of the Committee on the Present Danger and such
                    efforts to try to figure out how we could compete more effectively.</p>
                <p>So on the one hand you have an African shakeout process, African leaders and
                    African countries experimenting and struggling in some ways. On the other hand
                    you have the global geopolitical confrontation in a pretty active phase. Those
                    two things converged in the Seventies.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Now where were the bright spots in Africa? There were not a whole lot of bright
                    spots. It depends how you define “bright.” In that era bright meant stable.
                    Bright could also mean reliably friendly. But if it was just basically a corrupt
                    dictatorship, obviously that was a pretty thin basis of relationship but you
                    recognized that you had to work with some of your friends who might not be very
                    good at leadership and governance except in the sense of top-down imposed
                    stability, in places like Zaire, for example.</p>
                <p>So we would look at countries, some of which were not really all that close to
                    us, they were closer to the French, in some cases, a country like Senegal or
                    C�te d'Ivoire, they were important bastions of French influence. They also were
                    relatively stable, not least because there were French troops there and the
                    civilian elites knew how to keep the inheritance from being destroyed. Unlike
                    today, they did not tend to mess on the carpet, let's put it that way.</p>
                <p>Some other leaders didn't have quite that same experience. Chaotic developments
                    in parts of East Africa, like Uganda, for example, just a disaster.</p>
                <p>But if you asked me where the really bright spots were in Africa at that time,
                    there really weren't too many and there were issues of struggle to be worked
                    out. South Africa was moving along okay economically, but it was obvious that
                    South Africa had big internal issues to work through, and the question was one
                    of sequence. In any case, I think you'd be accurate to say that Africa was
                    looked at back at that time as a region full of challenge, of possibility of
                    real troubles and just barely getting on its feet, in terms of politically
                    defining its identity in world politics.</p>
                <p>One more point I guess I should make: the international system decolonized Africa
                    very late, after very brief colonial experience, for the most part,
                    sixty-seventy years, a very short colonial experience. Then Africa was
                    decolonized in a great rush between roughly 1957 and 1968, a huge rush. The
                    international system, including the UN and the Cold War bipolar political
                    structure, more or less created this new state system by recognizing all these
                    new elites and their flags, postage stamps, and their armies and their anthems
                    and their national days and their UN votes and all the rest but, frankly, it was
                    pretty artificial. The African state system was created by the international
                    system and it was a shallow and fragile and superficial state system and you
                    knew that it was going to have to become, over time, indigenous but it wasn't
                    really indigenous yet.</p>
                <p>So what would it become was kind of unclear, but the sense of nationhood was
                    very, very shallow indeed and what it meant for Africa's people, as well as its
                    governments, was that Africans were placed in the charge of new elites who often
                    used all that they'd inherited for personal benefit: for power, for enrichment.
                    There were very few checks and balances and there was very little inclination on
                    the part of East or West or former colonial powers to intervene, to force a
                    change in the political life of these countries. They basically were propped up
                    by the Cold War international system.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've been listening to a series of lectures on CD called
                        From Lucy to Mandela, but it's a series of lectures on the history of Africa
                        and unlike my knowledge of European history, I know when the Battle of
                        Hastings took place, there's a very little discussion of archaeology and all
                        of a sudden it's all colonial history and now what's happened since. Now,
                        obviously, things were happening in Africa, but there doesn't seem to be
                        much carryover from what happened during the sixteenth century, other than
                        colonial times, at least that we know of, that helped make a society
                        cohesive.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: There is a whole lot of African history that's pre-colonial, but your
                    point is that there doesn't seem to be much carryover of that history and of
                    course it's largely an unrecorded or undocumented history, which makes it much
                    harder to access, excepting through oral traditions and through archaeology and
                    through artifact. And what's happened, in a way, is that the scale of African
                    politics was transformed by the colonial experience. The pre-colonial experience
                    of African politics tended to be what we would call today microstates. The units
                    were small. So if you were to follow the ethnic pre-colonial map you might have
                    800 African states today, not 53. And that probably would not be better for
                    Africa, but it would certainly be different. So what happens within these new,
                    artificially created, European imposed boundaries of the new African states,
                    what happens within them, is that the pre-colonial politics of subunits,
                    ethnicities, if you like, tend to have a very important life of their own that
                    continues and often shapes in major ways what goes on within the modern African
                    state system.</p>
                <p>So we think, well, there's an African state called Niger or Chad and therefore
                    Nig�riens and Chadians ought to be thinking in a certain way or probably would
                    respond in a certain way, but of course it depends on whether they in fact
                    identify themselves at all as Chadians or they identify themselves as Arabs or
                    as Sara or as Zaghawa or some other ethnic group. Not easy to run a country that
                    is full of micro-polities and that's really what it is, in many cases, in
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here you came out of the Nixon Administration and then
                        during this period you were here at Georgetown, you have the Carter
                        Administration. How did you feel Carter and his administration handled
                        Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: In a nutshell, I thought there was a great deal of showboating, talking
                    the talk, identifying with a kind human rightsy approach to Africa without
                    recognizing the need to see the realpolitik of Africa, as I would call them. So
                    I was fairly critical, fairly outspoken on the way the Carter people handled,
                    for example, Central Africa. There were two occasions in which there was gross
                    intervention in the internal affairs of Zaire, Congo as it is today, the DRC, by
                    elements that were intervening from neighboring Angola and elsewhere.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Shaba I and II?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Shaba I and II, yes, '77 and '78. I thought we were a little slow to get
                    the point that basically this was being inspired by people who did not have good
                    intentions towards us, nor was it good for the African state system or African
                    stability. The issue wasn't, in those days, whether or not Zaire was well
                    governed. Of course it wasn't well governed. Neither was Angola well governed.
                    Neither was the Republic of Congo next door well governed. Neither was Zambia
                    well governed.</p>
                <p>That wasn't the issue. The issue wasn't governance, transparency, democracy or
                    human rights. The issue was stability in the African state system, the avoidance
                    of vacuums and chaos creating opening for external mischief-making. I thought we
                    were a little bit slow to see the point on that.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, we reacted very, what is the word, mechanistically and maybe
                    you could say ideologically during the Ogaden wars in the Horn of Africa in
                    '77-'78. We wound up switching alliances, winding up I think on the short end of
                    the stick, as the Ethiopians became the Soviets' friend and we would up with the
                    Somalis. Now I happen to like the Somalis, I think they're great, they're lovely
                    people and they, heaven knows, deserve a better fate than they've had in the
                    past thirty, forty years but that wasn't a great trade and somehow we managed to
                    take it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back in the early Sixties, for about 18 months, I was
                        Intelligence and Research officer for the Horn of Africa. My feeling was
                        Somalia's up for bids, but do you want it? At that time everything was based
                        on Kagnew</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: The Kagnew Station [a former U.S. intelligence-gathering installation in
                    Ethiopia, the part that is now Eritrea], right. Anyway, we were unable to ride
                    the tiger of the Ethiopian revolution very effectively in the mid-Seventies and
                    that, of course, pre-dated Carter. So it was difficult and you could tell that
                    the new dergue, as it became known, in Ethiopia was going to be a hard customer
                    to manage. Meanwhile, the Soviets had been well placed in Somalia. When the
                    Somalis decided to invade Ethiopia we mishandled that, I think, pretty
                    badly.</p>
                <p>So those were, the different strains within the Carter Administration that helped
                    to account for differences of emphasis in that record. I'm talking about
                    Brzezinski and Vance and so forth.</p>
                <p>And then of course there was the handling of the independence negotiations for
                    majority rule in Rhodesia/Zimbabwe. I was fairly outspoken and critical of the
                    way we were handling that. I thought the British had some good ideas. I felt
                    that we were inclined to be overly rigid in the way we defined legitimacy in the
                    struggle for majority rule in Zimbabwe.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>I felt the same way in Namibia, to some extent, that we were led somewhat blindly
                    into recognizing and working with one liberation group that was self-appointed,
                    self-anointed, not elected by anybody but as it happened very close either to
                    the Chinese or to the Russians and that we weren't really thinking about whether
                    there might be any alternative between continued white minority rule and what
                    you might call Marxist-oriented liberation groups. I tried to explore what that
                    middle ground might look like. Frankly it sometimes existed and sometimes it was
                    a mirage. There may not have been a genuine middle ground, in some cases.</p>
                <p>But in any event, what I felt most strongly about was that the Soviets had no
                    business shaping the transitions in African politics militarily. They had no
                    business doing that. They had no national interests that were legitimate in that
                    part of the world and if they were going to play that game, we had to counter
                    them by offering an alternative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see, looking at the Soviets in Africa, it always
                        seemed that this was sort of a misplaced entity. The Soviets, more than any
                        other group, just didn't fit very well there. I've talked to people when I
                        was in Belgrade who were coming out of Bulgaria or Africans out of Lumumba
                        University in Moscow and all and obviously the Russians and Bulgarians
                        didn't like blacks at all and I guess when they sent</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: If you look at the literature of this period, '76 to '80, there's a huge
                    number of working groups and study groups that were sponsored by all the major
                    universities, like Fletcher and SAIS and Columbia, as well as the Council on
                    Foreign Relations and other places, various research centers and so on, focused
                    on the debate between regionalists and globalists and the regionalists were
                    closer to the Carter people, who said, “African solutions for African problems”
                    and “We shouldn't get involved” and “We shouldn't compete.” The globalists said,
                    “The entire world is structured by the Cold War and wherever they go we've gotta
                    go.” And I was right smack in the middle of that debate and managed to make
                    enemies in both camps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about this. My initial question was, did you
                        see a fit for the Soviets in Africa? They just didn't seem to be a very good
                        post-colonial power.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: No, I think it was artificial for them. They found it hard to compete.
                    They didn't have much to compete with. There are all the famous stories of their
                    equipment sitting on docks in Africa, never getting unloaded. Great shiploads of
                    concrete that just turned into solid blocks and never got used for anything.
                    Equipment that was not suitable for tropical conditions and would break down
                    before it even got unpacked.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>In cultural terms, as you say, I think there was a very kind of rigid, racist
                    view of Africa and Africans. I think that's probably a fair statement. They got
                    better over time, but there certainly was some of that. You could sense that
                    what they were doing was figuring out how to get people kind of on their side
                    for UN purposes or for Middle East purposes or for European purposes, whatever.
                    They were playing a combination of an opportunistic game of acquiring influence,
                    expanding influence, getting basing rights and getting people to come and have
                    “friendly” bilateral relations.</p>
                <p>It was opportunistic in the sense that they were looking to block us. So wherever
                    we had something going, wherever there was an American or a Western plan or
                    presence, their role was to do the opposite. A lot of Soviet diplomats would
                    tell you today that they spent their entire career trying to block us from doing
                    what we were trying to do. They weren't trying to do anything themselves, they
                    were just trying to stop us from doing what we were trying to do. Of course some
                    of us were doing the reverse.</p>
                <p>But it was an interesting and you could say, in a way, why, why would they care?
                    One way of looking at it, if you're really a geostrategic thinker, is that while
                    the Middle East was the repository of the world's major share of energy
                    reserves, Africa was the Saudi Arabia of non-fuel minerals, or the Persian Gulf
                    of non-fuel minerals. By non-fuel minerals I'm not just talking gold and
                    diamonds. I'm talking platinum, manganese, chromium, and copper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now there's something that has to do with cell
                        phones.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Coltan, yes. Colombium tantalum, coltan, they call it for short, which
                    is used in handheld devices.</p>
                <p>But the interesting thing geostrategically is that if the Soviets, or Russians
                    and the southern Africans were in one bloc they would completely dominate the
                    world manganese, chromium and platinum markets. Those are important markets. So,
                    there were those who felt that this was the Soviet intention, that it wasn't
                    just an artificial search for UN votes, that they had in mind the Cape sea route
                    and they had in mind dominating mineral resources.</p>
                <p>I found that was an interesting argument. I did not completely dismiss it, but I
                    personally felt that the Soviets were not just thinking in those very tangible,
                    material terms, but they were also thinking like the traditional nineteenth
                    century big power players that they were. They were thinking about influence.
                    They were thinking about votes.</p>
                <p>And they were thinking about the kind of things that pro-Soviet regimes
                    specialized in, which was voting against us on every issue in the UN. They liked
                    that sort of thing. They liked bollixing up the machinery of the international
                    system by acquiring a following that would do their bidding.</p>

                        contact, or was there much contact with the Carter African people on your
                        part?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I knew some of them and some of them I know to this day, wonderful
                    people and very able people, in terms of the career people. I also knew Tony
                    Lake. I'd worked in the NSC staff with him. He used to be part of Kissinger's
                    apparat. Don McHenry was someone I came to know through the scholar diplomat
                    program. I knew some of these guys pretty well. The channels remained open,
                    let's put it that way. We would talk from time to time.</p>
                <p>By '78 I was not only here at Georgetown, I was down at CSIS as director of
                    African studies and from that platform I ran a program of meetings and events
                    focused on African issues, like the war in Angola, the Rhodesian struggle and so
                    forth. I published some monographs and some editorials and was quite critical of
                    certain aspects of the Carter policy.</p>
                <p>At the same time, I did not fall into the mindset of what you might call the
                    conservative or right wing side of the Republican view of Africa, which was that
                    it was all about the Cape sea route and minerals and the only friends we really
                    had were the white South Africans and the Rhodesians. That, to me, was very thin
                    and very artificial logic and dangerous logic.</p>
                <p>So to me it was a question of walking the line. Yes, it was true that one had to
                    address African conflict issues on their merits, in terms of what made sense
                    locally and regionally. It was also true that our global adversary was seeking
                    to opportunistically take advantage of African conflict to stimulate and to
                    militarize African conflict and we had to recognize the global dimension of
                    African problems, just as we had to recognize the regional dimension.</p>
                <p>In a sense that made me the skunk at the party with both the conservative
                    security studies constituencies in places like Fletcher or Columbia or even
                    Georgetown. On the other hand, it made me the skunk when it came to the African
                    Studies Association, because they thought I was bringing too much of the Cold
                    War into African problems. I didn't bring the Cold War. It wasn't I. The Cold
                    War came into Africa. So the issue was how do we conduct our side of the Cold
                    War in Africa in a way that would be in our interests as well as in the interest
                    of our friends in Africa and our friends in Europe and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>A couple of final points in that regard I should probably make. I have always
                    felt that the Europeans have a very important role to play in Africa. They're
                    still playing it today. One of the naive things about some of the more liberal
                    voices on African issues was to imagine that somehow we could replace the
                    Europeans, or that the Europeans were bad for Africa or that they represented
                    nothing but colonial histories and nothing that was future oriented.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>To me, that's rubbish. Africa is Europe's hinterland. Europe is one of Africa's
                    zones of opportunity and a very important continuing relationship partner. The
                    two are just as connected as we are with Mexico in many ways and that ought to
                    be appreciated and understood. It ought to enable us to have a more realistic
                    policy. So I've never seen our European allies as enemies, when it comes to
                    Africa. I didn't then and I don't now.</p>
                <p>Second point is and when the history is written may lead to endless controversy,
                    I don't think the United States and American officials or former officials
                    should be apologetic about the way we conducted ourselves during the Cold War in
                    Africa and some other areas.</p>
                <p>Now, properly defined, American interests are compatible with African interests.
                    I felt that way and I don't think it's really changed. Our interests are best
                    served when there is stability, when is there is legitimacy; stability can't
                    just be at gunpoint, it's gotta be legitimacy; and when there is enough security
                    for people to be able to start building civil orders and build a civil polity
                    and build a framework of law that permits economic development.</p>
                <p>So that's the sequence but it seemed to me at the time that our global adversary
                    wanted the opposite of those things: it wanted military politics, it wanted to
                    use the instrument of the gun to destabilize and undercut pro-Western positions
                    and it sought not negotiated solutions to African problems but, if you like,
                    dictated solutions to African problems.</p>
                <p>So my view of all this was that we did not have to be apologetic, but we had to
                    be smart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk intellectual. I'll leave it to you, as a
                        professor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Oh, dear, where to start? I guess one place to start is to make the
                    point that regional specialists in the different major regions, in the U.S.,
                    anyway and I think it's maybe true in some European countries, came to embrace
                    their regions with an uncritical passion that sometimes makes them more
                    interested in the interests of their region than the interests of their home
                    country. It's inevitable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We call it, in the State Department, “localitis.” I served
                        in the Balkans for nine years and, boy, did I get a belly full of
                        localitis.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes, I'm sure it's true for most every region. When it gets to the
                    academy and the professoriate, it can get really, really on the edge, in the
                    sense that some of the regional studies programs are outposts of a particular
                    slant of thinking that is not reflective of the national interest particularly,
                    but reflective of a kind of ideological battle. And Latin Americanists in the
                    academy have a longstanding reputation for being, shall we say, fashionable to
                    ultralefty. Africanists are often typed in a similar way. Arabists are not typed
                    necessarily that way, but they're typed in terms of their view of the
                    Israel-Arab conflict and US relations with Israel.</p>
                <p>So, quite frankly, the Africanist community found itself in debates in the 1970's
                    with mainstream geopolitical or strategic thinking that was going on at that
                    time. This was the era, after all, of Brezhnev. It was the era of the Soviet
                    Union feeling their oats after the American humiliation in Vietnam, pushing
                    towards creating a blue water navy, using proxy forces like Cubans and others,
                    East Germans, in places like the Ogaden and of course Angola.</p>
                <p>So what you had setting up here was a classic, fairly ideological, debate between
                    what you might call regionalist interpretations and globalist interpretations.
                    For the globalists or the geopolitical school, everything was determined by the
                    U.S.-Soviet rivalry and Africans, African leaders, African states, were merely
                    pawns on the chessboard. The regionalists saw many of the conflicts that
                    occurred in Africa as having local origins and moreover requiring African
                    solutions to African problems.</p>
                <p>So you had that kind of a debate going on a lot. We had it in the think tanks. We
                    had it in the academy.</p>
                <p>And I found myself in the middle of that and doing whatever I could when I wrote
                    to try to marry those two points of view, rather than take one side. In other
                    words, maybe local origins, but requiring that we recognize that we live in a
                    competitive world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, did the Marxist bent of many teachers in this
                        era, this is throughout academia, Marxism's last stand was sort of in the
                        academic world. You can correct me if I'm wrong, but it seemed to me, at
                        least of a mild form, seemed to permeate international studies. Did that
                        spill over into Africa? I can't see that it would make much headway there,
                        but</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, it did when it came to interpreting what was going on in terms of
                    the international relations of Africa, yes. You found it was very fashionable to
                    write about African states as being phony creations of the departing imperial
                    powers who intended to manipulate and control them from a distance, formal
                    decolonization but real control being retained in the metropoles.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>Latin American studies was diffused with dependency theory, dependencia,
                    dependency theory meaning that, as you know, the core controls the periphery.
                    Well, similar things were said a lot in African studies and when it came to the
                    U.S. and the Soviet Union, a lot of people were very critical of any American
                    effort to stem what was seen by the globalists as Soviet advances: “we shouldn't
                    bring the Cold War into Africa.”</p>
                <p>Well, of course, my response to that line of thinking was, “Who brought the Cold
                    War into Africa?” Africa had traditionally been a zone of Western influence and
                    the Soviets were the ones bringing in a competition. They were actually trying
                    to establish their own interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back on it, it's easy, in hindsight, to see at
                        least one factor and that was that the Soviets really just didn't have the
                        psychological makeup to get into Africa, particularly. They were real
                        racists and they just didn't have their empathy, plus the fact they probably
                        didn't have the technical know-how to really make much of a dent in Africa.
                        Were you seeing that at the time, or was that a factor? Maybe it
                        wasn't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Selectively, the Soviets knew how the game could be played and they knew
                    how to manipulate the nonaligned movement in some ways. They had extremely good
                    lawyers who knew the OAU charter and how it related to the UN charter and
                    doctrines of nonintervention in state sovereignty and so forth and they were
                    very good in New York at playing that game. So we had to be equally adept at
                    playing that game, sort of a normative legal game. That's where the Soviets
                    excelled and the East Germans excelled and you could see their hand on lots of
                    things that took place in different caucuses. So they were skillful at that sort
                    of thing.</p>
                <p>Of course the one instrument that they really did have was arms supplies and the
                    potential, with the Cubans, to have a direct coercive impact on specific
                    situations, by providing arms or training or intelligence or actually flying
                    troops in on occasion.</p>
                <p>You're right that they didn't have the functional entity. They have a long
                    history of being fairly racist towards lots of people, not only black Africans,
                    lots of other people. But they could swallow that and get beyond it and build
                    relationships based on power, essentially. And that's what they wound up doing
                    in a place like Angola or Ethiopia.</p>
                <p>And so the notion that we should not compete or that we should wait for African
                    solutions, always struck me as a little bit like pretending Africa wasn't part
                    of this planet. It was actually a competitive world.</p>
                <p>So for me the issue was how to enable African solutions, or negotiated solutions.
                    And you don't do that by turning a blind eye from what the Soviets were
                    doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The people who were talking about our not competing, were
                        they saying, “Well, let the Soviets have their day, they'll fade out.” Or
                        were they saying, “Well, maybe the communist solution's the real solution
                        for Africa.” Where were they coming from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I think they felt that the Africans could resist, they were kind of
                    inoculated against imperialism and they would probably resist any overly
                    heavy-handed Soviet thrust. And they may also have been inclined to just
                    downplay the military factor and not understand the military factor.</p>
                <p>A third element of course and this is where people like Jeane Kirkpatrick made
                    her career was by the fact that they would often say “Our friends are the
                    problem and therefore we shouldn't have the friends we have and if the Soviets
                    are undercutting an American friend, maybe that American friend is worthy of
                    being undercut.” Of course they'd point to Mobutu always when that conversation
                    came up and say, “Zaire, what kind of a friend is that?”</p>
                <p>Of course the issue was that if the Soviets wound up overthrowing that regime and
                    putting one of their friends in power in a place like that, that would have a
                    big strategic consequence for central and southern Africa.</p>
                <p>So we had these debates. If you watched the congressional hearings of the late
                    Seventies, they would focus on, when the Democrats, particularly, had control of
                    the committees, you'd see hearings that were designed to go after Morocco and
                    Zaire, those were the enemies of the liberals, if you like. And the more
                    conservative voices were saying, “Wait a minute, this is a competitive world.
                    Who are we saying we support, Algeria and Congo-Brazzaville? Come on!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Morocco, it's one of those funny things, that Morocco, the
                        Polisario, really the glitterati sort of focused on them, in a way, as they
                        had with the Biafrans before. It's this “What's the flavor of the month?”
                        thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, the Polisario was seen in some quarters as a legitimate liberation
                    group, never mind it was created by a combination of Algerian cash and sometimes
                    Libyan arms and other things and that you might ask the question: does Africa
                    need another ministate? You might ask that question, are these really indigenous
                    liberation groups, or not?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find sort of your place in the academic world
                        and not just with your peers but also did you find yourself having students
                        who were coming from various areas? Where do the students come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, I was teaching here at Georgetown, which is not really a hotbed of
                    sort of fashionable intellectual leftism and I didn't find students were all
                    that inclined to be in a different place from where I was. To be very blunt
                    about it, I was wrestling with two paradigms. I understood the importance of
                    understanding Africa as Africa and understanding the region, but I insisted that
                    it was part of the world and that we had a global relationship of rivalry and we
                    had to relate these two things somehow. And what the West had to offer and this
                    was the important point, was statecraft and political solutions, negotiations as
                    an alternative to simply militarizing the conflicts of Africa.</p>
                <p>Obviously what I'm leading up to was the liberation struggles that hadn't yet
                    been finished in southern Africa: the Portuguese colonies, Rhodesia/Zimbabwe,
                    Namibia and South Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The time we're talking about, the Seventies, there was
                        still a Democratic majority in Congress and all, but was there a growing
                        sort of Republican, more conservative, or of a different cast, that you
                        would find yourself joined up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: That's the point. There certainly was. There was the Committee on the
                    Present Danger. There were what you might call the Scoop Jackson Democrats, who
                    were walking away from the party because they did not see themselves as that
                    kind of Democrat. They were not part of what Kirkpatrick called the “blame
                    America first” crowd.</p>
                <p>So you had that movement among former Democrats. You had more Republican
                    conservatives coming together and coalescing around the 1979-80 electoral
                    campaign plans of the different candidates. And I found myself in the middle of
                    that.</p>
                <p>And a lot of the more conservative voices, to answer your question, were arguing
                    that everything in Africa was about East-West, it was about the Soviets were
                    pursuing an aggressive and coherent denial strategy, they were going to cut off
                    the Cape sea route, they were going to block the Suez Canal, they were going to
                    deny non-fuel minerals, manganese and chromium and platinum, they were going to
                    deny those. So you had a kind of very hard line geopolitical counterargument to
                    the left's argument.</p>
                <p>And I thought they were both wrong. They were both wrong. The Soviets were not
                    that clever. They were not that coherent. And the idea of blocking the Cape sea
                    route always struck me as a rather exotic strategic objective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Jeane Kirkpatrick? Where did she fit, from your
                        perspective</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, I had great respect for the late Jeane Kirkpatrick. She was a
                    great lady. She could be superglobalist in her orientation on occasion. She
                    would always draw the distinction between their proxies and our proxies. Our
                    proxies were always better. That was the end of the discussion, is he on our
                    side, we should support them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Portuguese and the sort of people like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well and Mobutu. When she and I would tangle, once we were both in the
                    administration, it would be over what kind of conversation we should be having
                    through our diplomats with Mobutu in Zaire on aid conditionality and
                    rescheduling of debt and things like that. And she'd point out that the voting
                    record of Zaire in the UN was better than that of Kenya or Zambia, so why don't
                    we do more for Zaire?</p>
                <p>So we had our differences, to be frank, we had our differences, but she stirred
                    things up in different ways sometimes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're moving towards the Reagan election in 1980. Was
                        there a sort of a shadow foreign policy group to which you belonged
                        forming?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, by '78 I had affiliated myself, in fact before '78, with the
                    Center for Strategic and International Studies, which as you know is one of the
                    leading think tanks in town. At that time it was affiliated with Georgetown
                    University. They de-affiliated in the Eighties for a variety of reasons, but I
                    joined my friend and colleague Michael Samuels, who created the Third World
                    studies program at CSIS and I took on the job of carving out of that an African
                    studies program.</p>
                <p>And I would describe CSIS at that time as a centrist to conservative organization
                    and that's where I was comfortable. But as I was saying a minute ago, the
                    leading, loudest voices were hard line, or else they were very, very liberal.
                    And so quite often we found ourselves kind of a little lonely there in the
                    middle, because we were arguing a centrist message, both Mike Samuels and myself
                    and a lot of other people around David Abshire, who really created the Center.
                    They were not way over on one side or the other.</p>
                <p>So that's where I was comfortable. I was very active at the Council of Foreign
                    Relations. I was active up at the Fletcher School, with its think tank and SAIS
                    had its think tank as well as Georgetown and we would go to meetings and working
                    groups and participate and express our views. I was an active participant in all
                    this back then.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>I think a lot of folks were a little worried about where was this kind of
                    pragmatism going to lead when it came to the issues of Rhodesia and Namibia and
                    South Africa. And as you know, during this period there were controversial
                    debates about South Africa. This was at the time, post-Sharpeville and
                    post-Soweto riots and the Carter Administration, which took a view towards a lot
                    of these issues which was quite different from where I was coming from. So I was
                    outspoken.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you describe the Carter Africa policy, as you
                        saw it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Africa for the Africans, don't bring the Cold War into Africa, get on
                    the right side, which means both rhetorically and diplomatically isolate and put
                    pressure on the South Africans and also press hard on Rhodesia for independence
                    and majority rule.</p>
                <p>Of course, everyone supported independence and majority rule for Rhodesia. The
                    issue really was, how do you get there, who do you negotiate with, who sits at
                    the table, what are the terms of reference in the negotiation?</p>
                <p>I was a fairly active participant in those debates. It seemed to me quite often
                    that we Americans were a little more catholic than the pope on this transition
                    process , and I was quite happy to see the British in the lead on Rhodesia and
                    ultimately it was the British at Lancaster House that brought about a negotiated
                    independence, ironically under the Thatcher government.</p>
                <p>So it came out okay in the end, but some of the diplomacy along the way I
                    participated in debates about and felt that we were leaning so heavily on the
                    side of one liberation group, namely the one that wound up prevailing, that it
                    was distorting things politically and not giving other nationalists and related
                    moderates a fair hearing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this just better PR, or was this saying, “Well, they
                        look like the winner, so let's get on their bandwagon?” What was the factor,
                        would you say, to cause our support?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>CROCKER: Partly a political intelligence assessment that would argue that ZANU,
                    as it became, was the group with the largest social base being the Shona people,
                    who are the largest language group in Zimbabwe. And there were discussions about
                    whether we should be more aligned with that group or with ZAPU, as it was then
                    called, which was Joshua Nkomo's party, or should we pay more attention to the
                    internal, nonmilitary, parties, such as Bishop Muzorewa and Reverend Ndabaningi
                    Sithole's party. These were political armies that didn't have military armies
                    and therefore were not aligned with either Moscow or Beijing, whereas the other
                    two that I mentioned did have armies, they were based in neighboring countries,
                    they were guerilla liberation movements. Part of the debate was a classic
                    Western debate about 'do you support the guys with the guns and if so which guys
                    with guns, or do you try to give some competition to the guys with the guns by
                    giving some air time to non-militarized movements.'</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did things play out for you, as far as moving up
                        to the election of 1980?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I was fortunate that CSIS was in its own way a congenial home for
                    writing and research and outreach. We ran discussion groups. I ran meetings, a
                    very active meetings programs that brought together visiting Africans and
                    invited participants from the policy Washington community.</p>
                <p>It gave me a little bit of visibility, and I was recruited by the George Herbert
                    Walker Bush presidential campaign, during the primary season, to join his
                    foreign policy brain trust, and I said yes, I would do that and went up to
                    Kennebunkport and got to know George Bush from that time forward and considered
                    myself comfortable with his brand of Republicanism.</p>
                <p>Of course, George Bush didn't win those primaries and then when it became clear
                    that Reagan was the candidate a different set of people were recruiting advisory
                    task forces to shape policies for the transition and I was recruited to that. So
                    it was just like a direct handoff.</p>
                <p>And I was kind of the lead Africa person, both with Bush and then with Reagan.
                    Why that happened is partly good luck, maybe, or bad luck, depending on how you
                    look at it. Partly the fact that CSIS I think was a pretty good launching pad if
                    one was ambitious.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that George Herbert Walker Bush would
                        have a much sounder idea of African realities, coming from the UN, than most
                        of the people in political campaigns. Did you find this, or do you have a
                        different view?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>CROCKER: You're right. He had had some experience up there. He knew some African
                    leaders, some African UN permreps and so forth and so he had some working
                    knowledge of what it was like to have diplomatic ties and discussions with
                    Africans. Whereas Candidate Reagan's view of Africa was much more derivative,
                    based on op-eds that he'd read or based on things that he'd read or heard about
                    who was a good guy or who wasn't, that sort of thing; much less involved in the
                    actual working diplomacy and how the diplomatic policy machinery actually
                    works.</p>
                <p>My sense was that candidate Bush knew where the trouble spots were. Of course,
                    during the primary season he was watching his right flank all the time, because
                    he didn't want to be typed as somebody who could be dismissed as “Oh, you're
                    another one of them.” He didn't want to be seen as just like Jimmy Carter, nor
                    was he. He understood it's a competitive world. So he got the point that we
                    needed to be active and to compete. And he wanted to know what our diplomatic
                    options were in southern Africa or the Horn of Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, during the campaign of 1980, here you're the Africa
                        person, I can't imagine that Africa played any role at all in the
                        campaign.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Not much. I think it was referred to once or twice in a couple of
                    debates, but, no, there were obviously a lot of other issues, the primary issue
                    having to do with how do you respond to what was seen as Soviet adventurism. And
                    it was in that context that a Candidate Reagan might point out that we need to
                    block Soviet adventurism, whether it's in Afghanistan or Iran or Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself in a competitive position within the
                        campaign staff, trying to get the candidate to say something about your
                        area, or were you sort of there, if he wanted something you had it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: We wrote the Q's and A's. We wrote the briefing books and we submitted
                    position papers, as you would expect, during the campaign, but we were not in as
                    much demand, probably, because that's the way American foreign policy is
                    structured, as the people working on missile throw weights and Soviet policies
                    and that kind of thing. But we did prepare the obvious position papers on things
                    like Libya, the southern African struggles I've referred to, the Horn of Africa,
                    Soviet presence and Soviet adventurism, probably a few points on private
                    enterprise and then the role of the private sector in development, a few things
                    of that sort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for President Reagan as Reagan the
                        candidate? Looking back, he was never obviously a great intellectual, but at
                        the same time, in retrospect, he had the right mind set on a lot of
                        things.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes, he had a terrific personal presence and you knew when you looked at
                    him and heard him perform in a debate or in a press conference that this was a
                    person who was comfortable in his skin. And maybe that's not always a good
                    thing, but this was a man who was very comfortable in his skin. He wasn't trying
                    to be something that he wasn't. So he was a reassuring person. A lot of people
                    liked that personal manner about him, he made the broad populace often feel
                    comfortable rather than challenged..I recall when Jimmy Carter in the
                    presidential debates talked about how his daughter, Amy, had been so worried
                    about nuclear proliferation that he as president wanted to make sure that there
                    wasn't more nuclear proliferation. Reagan responded, “There you go again!” It
                    was the riposte of a populist candidate running against a more intellectualizing
                    and analytical type of candidate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I would have thought that Reagan would have been
                        much more, you might say, sympathetic to the white South Africans and their
                        side in South Africa, just because of sort of the way the stars were aligned
                        I think in the political world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes, to get to the substance, there's no question that he came into the
                    presidency with a view of the Soviets and a view of who our friends might be
                    that was very, very specific and very clear and he made utterances about our
                    friends on occasion that would indicate that he didn't suffer any doubts about
                    it.</p>
                <p>And of course the list included the white South African government of the time;
                    he said things like “They fought with us in every war we've been in.” I don't
                    think he was going back to 1776; he was talking twentieth century wars. And of
                    course, historically he was accurate, but he would word it wrong. He would say
                    “the government of South Africa” or the “South African republic” had been with
                    us in every war, forgetting that, in fact, in the South African forces there had
                    been South Africans of color, not just whites. Of course the forces were
                    white-led back then, but during World War II there were very substantial numbers
                    of black Africans in the allied forces, under the command of British and South
                    African and Indian and other generals. The president wasn't making any reference
                    to that.</p>
                <p>So his message came across as support for white South Africa. That was the
                    rhetoric and that's the way it was read, that's the way it was read in Africa
                    and the way it was read here, to some extent. That obviously created a certain
                    backdrop or an image which was a continuous concern for me, because it was a
                    racially one-sided message.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there others who shared your concern, who said,
                        “Okay, once we get past the campaign, we can put things together”?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>CROCKER: Oh, yes. I knew this was going to be a challenge. I knew that the
                    Republican Party was not unified on these issues and I knew that I was going to
                    be working, if I went into the administration, we hadn't got there yet, but if I
                    went in I would be working in an administration that had some pretty hardline
                    voices in it who were not interested in the complex realities of the region I'd
                    be working in, they didn't want to hear about the complexities. They were quite
                    happy with the “What side are you on, anyway?” kind of message.</p>
                <p>There were other people around the advising networks during the transition, who
                    had a range of views, but I think most people who knew the region well realized
                    we had to be more sophisticated than saying we're on one side in each case.
                    Anyway, I think that a lot of folks who were watching this transition realized
                    that this would be a baptism of fire for someone like myself, who saw the region
                    on its merits and not just based on a few op-eds. President-elect Reagan had
                    been fairly outspoken on Namibia, in some comments he'd made and also on
                    Rhodesia, which had just become Zimbabwe.</p>
                <p>So there were some challenges there from the very beginning. Al Haig, who was the
                    Secretary of State-designate, and I would meet from time to time about how we
                    were going to conduct a policy that reflected our need for a strong arm and a
                    strong relationship with South Africa and other close, pro-West partners but
                    also an effective diplomacy with the bulk of the black African states.
                    Otherwise, we're nowhere. You can't have an African policy based on one country
                    under the control of a white minority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your sort of initial reaction to the Lancaster
                        House agreement, the creation of Zimbabwe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I would say that the Thatcher government seized victory from the jaws of
                    defeat, in a way, because the diplomacy leading up to it, before Lancaster
                    House, had left a bit of shambles and I think the Brits did the best they could,
                    in terms of negotiating a deal that would provide a democratic opportunity for
                    the people of Zimbabwe. They couldn't prevent the history, they weren't going to
                    occupy the country with vast numbers of troops and stop the guerilla insurgency,
                    so the reality was that while the government of Rhodesia was still in control in
                    the daytime, the guerillas were in control of Zimbabwe at night.</p>
                <p>And when the Brits sent in Governor Soames and so forth to run the transition
                    with limited numbers of police observers and so forth and limited numbers of
                    troops from the Commonwealth, everybody knew that there's a substantial
                    insurgent presence inside the country and those guys weren't going away.</p>
                <p>So it was quite likely that the message coming from the ZANU-PF was that “You
                    don't vote for us, we're going to win anyway.” And of course they surprised
                    people by winning. A lot of people thought they wouldn't win, but they won.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get your job as assistant secretary? Was this
                        sort of a done deal or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I've never really pursued that question in detail, but I was the
                    candidate of choice for Al Haig and he put my name forward and that was agreed.
                    The president had written me several handwritten notes on op-eds that I'd
                    written, saying, “I like this line of thinking.” So the president was aware of
                    the name and he realized that I'd said some things that were critical about the
                    way the Carter policies had played out , so the president liked that kind of
                    thing and he was in the mode of writing notes. So he'd heard the name, Haig
                    wanted me to be his candidate and I think Dick Allen knew me from the
                    previous</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the national security advisor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: The national security advisor, Dick knew me and what he really thought
                    about me at the time I don't know, I suspect he had a somewhat more conservative
                    take on a lot of these African issues than I did, but Dick said “Fine, Crocker
                    would be okay in AF in the State Department and we can keep an eye on him” and
                    that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>The people who were not happy about my appointment were the people who were on
                    the hard right side and that's primarily people in the Congress, more than
                    inside the administration. I think Jeane Kirkpatrick, bless her, I don't want to
                    speak ill of the departed, probably also had a few suspicions that maybe I was
                    too well informed about Africa or too much into the details and not enough in
                    the Big Picture. And there were some future neocons like Elliot Abrams and Paul
                    Wolfowitz who were in that team that Haig assembled and we had occasional
                    differences, but I worked okay with them. In the end we cooperated in developing
                    a strategy that made sense, but the real problems were on the Hill and among
                    some of the lobby groups.</p>
                <p>There were Hill conservatives led by Jesse Helms who were very anxious to prevent
                    my confirmation or to condition my confirmation by imposing on Haig some
                    additional appointments around me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that happen? Did you have Hill cohorts as deputy
                        assistant secretaries or that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Stuart, no, that did not happen, but it took me over six months to win
                    that fight and get confirmed. So I was an acting assistant secretary and trying
                    to conduct an ambitious round of launch diplomacy on southern Africa while being
                    'acting' for six months.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with this? I mean, first place, was it
                        the Helms crew and all, what were they doing, were they just</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: They were doing everything they could to undercut or harass me, trying
                    to figure out how to get me to ether resign or to accept a deputy that they
                    would nominate. They had in mind an individual in particular who had been
                    associated with them in some way and who I think had been associated with the
                    South African government. In fact, I became absolutely certain that this
                    individual that they wanted me to accept as the deputy had done work for the
                    South African government, if not being on retainer to the South African
                    government.</p>
                <p>At one point, I can remember, which tells you maybe something about my Scorpio
                    qualities, this must have been April or May of 1981, Al Haig called me up to his
                    office and said, “You know, Chet, if you really want this job, you may have to
                    get rid of one of your inherited deputies,” someone I had high regard for and
                    was learning a lot from and had no intention of getting rid of, “and you may
                    have to accept somebody that has some support up on the Hill”. I said, “Al, if
                    that's the terms for my becoming your assistant secretary for African affairs, I
                    don't want the job.” He just shook his head.</p>
                <p>And so we went on for two more months, three more months, of battles. I was tied
                    up in the same process as Tom Enders and Larry Eagleburger and a bunch of
                    others, who also were not confirmable at that stage. So eventually what had to
                    take place was that the more moderate or responsible Republicans had to confront
                    those with the holds on these nominations and eventually the holds went
                    away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you just left in limbo, or were you being called up
                        and questioned in detail and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: No, I went up for my confirmation hearing. The hearing went okay, but it
                    was very amusing and I'll never forget it, if you could image, I only had the
                    one day of hearings but then this was followed up with 108 questions from the
                    Helms staff that were sent to the Africa bureau, 108 questions! And just the
                    wording of the questions told you where the question was coming from. Things
                    like, “Do you believe that the South African government should ever have to
                    negotiate its future with black opposition groups that are wedded to violence?”
                    or language like that. Or “Do you think that the Soviet Union is seeking to
                    control the Cape sea route?” Very leading questions like this and some of them
                    could only have been written in Pretoria. You knew that they were plants, in
                    effect.</p>
                <p>So here we were, the American government at work and at play being manipulated by
                    foreign interests who knew how to insinuate themselves into our system and
                    exploit our readily apparent differences. What else is new? It happens in other
                    parts of the world. It certainly happened in this part of the world.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>But during my day of hearings I was welcomed by Senator Helms. Chuck Percy was
                    the chair, wasn't he, at that point?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Percy was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: So Percy was very, very diplomatic and polite and congenial, welcomed me
                    and then when it came Helms' turn, he said, “Now Mr. Crocker, I'm sure your dog
                    wags his tail when you go home at night. That's not my question. My question is,
                    are you going to support the president's policies?”</p>
                <p>And then Paul Tsongas and Chris Dodd and a couple of others spoke, and Tsongas
                    joked “Mr. Crocker, I kind of like some of your writings, but would it help you
                    if I voted for you or against you?” So already I was being typed as someone that
                    some Democrats could support but some conservative Republicans had issues with
                    me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, back in your home camp, the fact that you
                        were aligned with the Reagan Administration, did you find that in the
                        academic world there was a group that was sort of shunning you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes. It took a while, but by the time we had fully launched our
                    policies, which were typed as constructive engagement and constructive
                    engagement was typed in a distorted and erroneous way, with the wrong
                    definitions, from early on in the administration. So, yes, there was some bridge
                    burning and there were some former professional colleagues who became sworn
                    adversaries of the policy and became very articulate critics of it and were
                    writing critical articles and op-eds and this led to a parting of the ways of
                    some relationships in a few cases.</p>
                <p>My job was to come into an African bureau that was overwhelmingly peopled by
                    folks who'd had a regional focus on Africa for much of their career, many of
                    them suspicious, of where the Republicans were going on Africa and unsure
                    whether or not they would be comfortable working with and for me;, I had the
                    grand total of two political appointments I could make in the entire bureau - a
                    special assistant and maybe a political deputy.</p>
                <p>So it was my job to figure out how to make this complex State Department
                    machinery actually work on a nonpartisan basis, or on a basis that was effective
                    in support of U.S. policy under the president of the day. I wasn't trying to
                    push Republicanism down into the ranks so much as to push an effective strategy
                    down into the ranks.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>I guess the point I'm making is I wanted the best people I could get around me in
                    the African bureau and we worked very hard throughout the 1980's to have a first
                    class recruitment and placement program in terms of personnel. The African
                    bureau, by the end of the Eighties, was a place people wanted to go to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It has a reputation of caring for its people, too. This is
                        very important.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Very important. But I inherited some damned good people from the
                    previous administration. I kept some of them on. I couldn't keep others of them
                    on, but I kept a couple of them on for quite a considerable time and I recruited
                    other people into the bureau who had worked with the Carter people. So this
                    wasn't a highly political operation.</p>
                <p>I remember having long discussions with my friend and colleague Paul Hare, who I
                    inherited as the director of the Southern African office in the State
                    Department, about where we were going and I learned a lot from Paul Hare.
                    Another was my senior deputy, Lannon Walker, who I inherited and I kept him on
                    for the better part of the first year, before I recruited Frank Wisner to join
                    me as senior deputy. And we recruited Jim Bishop ,(James K. Bishop), just a
                    world class all around deputy and</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Renowned for being evacuated from more posts under fire
                        than any</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Absolutely, but if there's one guy you'd ever want to have in the
                    command post or in the sit room when the balloon goes up, got a mind like a
                    steel trap, it's Jim Bishop. And Princeton Lyman, as my economic and foreign
                    assistance deputy, ultimately, took a while to get him in place, but he made
                    major contributions to our policies both during the Reagan years and since. We
                    established a first class team. I tried not to apply ideological, partisan
                    litmus tests here. I was looking for the best people. We got some.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would imagine, knowing Al Haig's interests and all, that
                        his instructions to you would be almost, “Just don't make Africa something
                        that comes to my attention,” or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I would have thought that was the case, but he surprised some people. We
                    had the choice when we came into office, we Reaganites, of continuing the Carter
                    policies, creating our own strategic framework, or basically taking a walk and
                    not having a policy toward this troubled region of southern Africa. And I wasn't
                    the kind of person who was going to have that last approach, of not having a
                    policy. There is that option usually, of a “no policy policy,” but that didn't
                    interest me. We had things we should be doing and I was determined to try and
                    get them done and to sell that approach internally with the administration.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>Obviously I couldn't, we couldn't, continue the Carter policies. We had sharp
                    differences on some issues and we were determined to take a step back and
                    reassess.</p>
                <p>So those were the three choices and Al Haig had just come from his post at NATO,
                    that was his most recent public service position. He brought a very
                    European-oriented focus to his job as Secretary of State and he understood that
                    central and southern Africa were of great concern to our NATO allies and that if
                    we wanted to do anything in that region we could not do it without the allies.
                    So he was an ally for me, in the sense that he understood right off the bat,
                    from day one, that we had to have a policy that you could sell, particularly to
                    Thatcher and to Kohl and to Mitterrand. Not just Kohl, but to Kohl and Genscher,
                    of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Genscher being the German foreign minister.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: The German foreign minister, who came from the FDPand had a different
                    view from Kohl on a lot of issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had his own foreign policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Had his own foreign policy and his own people and so forth.</p>
                <p>So Haig got the point, that if we're going to do anything active and serious in
                    Africa we're not going to do it by ourselves. And that was a terrific assist for
                    me, because if we'd tried to do it unilaterally we could go off in any number of
                    half-assed directions and we'd be on our own and everybody'd know we were. But
                    if we're doing it in an allied context, it would mean a lot of close-in work, in
                    terms of coordination with allies, who would help on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Lancaster House agreement had in a way set a pattern,
                        hadn't it? We were involved with</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yeah, we were. We supported it. It was a British lead, but we supported
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was something one could build on, say, as far as a
                        multinational approach, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: We could definitely build on it and it set a precedent for working hand
                    in glove with the Brits. There was, of course, the history of the special
                    relationship in all kinds of issues around the world, globally. There was the
                    fact of very close intel sharing and cooperation with the Brits. There was the
                    fact that in southern Africa the British knew the region better than anybody,
                    including ourselves. They had the long history there and they used to run the
                    place.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>And so it made sense to do things with the Brits. The question was, would we do
                    it with the Europeans? Would we do it with a broader group?</p>
                <p>Now, I have to do a little sidebar here. We inherited from the Carter
                    Administration an initiative on Namibia specifically, for Namibian independence,
                    which had been launched by something called the Western Contact Group, which
                    consisted of the Western members of the Security Council in 1978, namely
                    Britain, France, Germany, Canada and the United States. Two of those, of course,
                    are permanent members of the Council and the other two are not.</p>
                <p>So we inherited from the Vance period, from Don McHenry, particularly, who had
                    worked this problem, that structure of the Western Contact Group. So one of the
                    early issues that we assessed was are we going to continue to work with the
                    Western Contact Group on Namibia, are we going to press forward with something
                    called “the Western plan,” otherwise known as UN Security Council Resolution 435
                    for Namibian independence, or are we going to abandon it and go in some very
                    different direction?</p>
                <p>The point I'm making, though, is that Haig understood from the get-go the
                    importance of having allied support for whatever it was we chose to do, so the
                    question then became: what is it we will choose to do? Will we just continue
                    with that Resolution 435 approach, or will we change it? And so we had a
                    ten-week policy review in early 1981 over that precise question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How does a policy review work? What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, what happened in this case is that Haig told me to write a policy
                    paper laying out my view of how we should pursue the inherited but stalled
                    diplomacy over southern Africa. I suspect that he asked two or three other
                    people to write a memo and that he got input as well from Policy Planning Staff
                    and from the International Organizations bureau and perhaps from Jeane
                    Kirkpatrick and perhaps from one of his special assistants.</p>
                <p>So he was getting multiple inputs and this led to a series of face-to-face
                    meetings and we finally hammered out a strategy at the end of ten weeks, which
                    Al Haig then took to the president, to sell to the president. It wasn't so much
                    an interagency review as it was a State Department review, that then was taken
                    over to the president by Al Haig.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it you weren't infected with what during the
                        present Bush Administration is known as “ABC,” Anything But Clinton,
                        anything that Clinton had done was immediately bad. But you didn't have this
                        feeling anything Carter had done was bad, you have to go counter to it? You
                        could use what was done as something to build on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>CROCKER: I think the politics more broadly were probably one of distancing from
                    Carter and we don't want to do what Carter did and we didn't agree with a lot of
                    what Carter did. In reality, when you inherit a complicated diplomatic
                    initiative you have a decision to make. Do you just scrub it, in which case the
                    allies are going to go catatonic, because they're committed to it, too. They
                    have domestic constituents, they have their own UN record and public
                    commitments, and all of this. So if we were to simply scrap everything that we
                    inherited, I think the British would have been very, very uneasy and they would
                    have had a lot of their African equities on the line and the Germans, too and
                    the French, not to mention the Canadians. So we had to consider that.</p>
                <p>My personal view was, precisely as you said, we could use the inherited diplomacy
                    as a point of departure, rather than scrap it. But there were others who wanted
                    a cleaner break, who wanted us to be seen differing from the predecessors,
                    visibly seen differing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there, in Congress, a very strong support of the
                        white government and all its ramifications in South Africa, but also its
                        effect on Namibia and all this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes, there was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Helms and</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Helms and I'd say eight to ten others in the Senate. It wasn't that they
                    had any kind of majority, but they were very, very focused and they had very
                    capable staff and they would try to influence the administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't want to be pejorative, but was this racial, or
                        were there other factors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I think it's a mixture of a lack of interest in (and sensitivity to)
                    racial politics and to hell with it, if the guys that are our friends are white
                    and they're in the minority and they're running the place, so what? Not unlike
                    the way the South used to be run in some respects. But of course in the South it
                    was mostly white majority rule, not white minority rule.</p>
                <p>I don't want to throw the label around any more than you do, but there was a
                    racist insensitivity that was just impossible to work with. You can't, as an
                    American diplomat, American statesman, you can't stand up and say that you only
                    care about the views of a white minority in a continent that's 900 million
                    people, overwhelmingly who are not white. It's just dumb, is what it is. Leave
                    aside the ethical or moral dimension, it's just dumb.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, out of this policy review, exercise of everybody
                        looking at the matter and Namibia, what did you come out with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, of course Namibia is a pretty small place in the broader scheme of
                    things, but it was the litmus test issue and the hot issue, the pregnant issue,
                    throughout southern Africa and to some degree in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa.
                    Rhodesia had just become Zimbabwe. Mozambique and Angola were both Marxist
                    ex-Portuguese territories that were in the hands of governments at the time that
                    we viewed as aligned to Moscow. In the case of Angola, very aligned to
                    Moscow.</p>
                <p>South Africa was obviously the regional superpower, but it also was a deeply
                    troubled society with a racist system of government. Legislated apartheid was
                    not only evil but it was failing, visibly failing. And therefore the question
                    was, how will South Africa change, what will be the process for achieving change
                    in South Africa?</p>
                <p>So this was part of a bigger scheme of things. Our approach was, you don't start
                    with South Africa. You start with the issue that's hot and that's Namibia,
                    because that's the one that everyone's expecting you to address and the one you
                    kind of have to address because of the inherited diplomatic groundwork, the
                    expectations of the diplomatic process. It's a sequential thing.</p>
                <p>And so what we said was, we will try to work with the new government of Robert
                    Mugabe in Zimbabwe, we'll try to work with the African Front Line States (FLS -
                    Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe), we'll try to work
                    with South Africa, to get a negotiated solution in Namibia. But there's got to
                    be something in it for South Africa. It's not going to work if it's just
                    decolonizing the last African colony.</p>
                <p>After all, the liberation group in Namibia had not liberated any of Namibia. It
                    was sitting next door in Angola and in Zambia and it was rather feckless,
                    militarily .. So if we want the South Africans to cooperate on a diplomatic
                    approach, there's got to be something in it for South Africa. And by the way,
                    there's got to be something in it for us.</p>
                <p>As we look across that region at that time, 1980-81, what do we see that might be
                    a positive incentive, a worthy goal, for us? Well, getting the Cubans out of
                    Africa would be a big prize, because they were the only conventional threat that
                    could lead to imposed military solutions next door in Namibia. The Cubans were
                    the only organized conventional force that you could say was in some way going
                    to be able to challenge the South African conventional forces, or to impose
                    their own solutions in neighboring countries of the southern African region when
                    there might be political issues of interest to them. They were a strategic wild
                    card - both for the Castro regime and in a larger sense for the Soviet global
                    enterprise.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>So our view was that what had to be done was link a Namibian settlement to an
                    Angolan settlement, in which Cubans would depart from southern Africa on a time
                    phased negotiated calendar of withdrawal. So we said, “We're not scrapping
                    Resolution 435, we are adding a pragmatic reality to 435, which is that there
                    will have to be parallel movement on the Angolan track.”</p>
                <p>And we set up this construct and then had to try to sell it, first to the allies,
                    then to South Africa, then to the African front line states, including Angola.
                    So it was a very, very ambitious departure. We were saying, “Yes, Namibian
                    independence, linked to Cuban troop withdrawal from Angola and this will
                    transform the strategic environment of southern Africa.”</p>
                <p>That was what we came up with in our policy review. Once we revealed it, which
                    took place a little later, the press would ask Al Haig questions like: “Well,
                    have you abandoned UN Security Council Resolution 435?”</p>
                <p>“No.”</p>
                <p>“Well, haven't you added a new condition?”</p>
                <p>And Haig would say, “It's not a condition, but we think there'll have to be some
                    empirical simultaneity.” This was classic Haig-speak. So we had a policy of
                    empirical simultaneity, in other words linkage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were going through this, what was the role of the
                        contact group, the other four Western powers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: They were concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, how did they feel? First place, they must have been
                        sort of suspicious when your crew came in, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Very and some of them were inclined to write us off and others were
                    inclined to do the opposite, which is to try to work with us and influence us as
                    best they could. And of course our cousins in the UK were the best at that. They
                    were very familiar with the process of trying to educate the Americans. “Toilet
                    training” was what we called it. They always reminded us of the Churchillian
                    phrase about how the Americans usually do the right thing, after exhausting all
                    alternatives.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>They came over on weekly missions to test the pulse. And they would reach out to
                    me and then when I wasn't in the room, reach out to my colleagues: “How's
                    Crocker doing? Is he going to make it? How's the internal review going? Is Haig
                    listening to Crocker, or is he listening to the other people, or listening to
                    Kirkpatrick?” The Brits were really connected here and they always have been. So
                    they were watching and</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is, of course, before the great love affair between
                        Reagan and Thatcher came.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: He admired her from the get-go, but, yes, you're right, it was before it
                    really got intense.</p>
                <p>So the British embassy here and the FCO in London was working us, as they're good
                    at doing, to find out exactly where the ball was and when the next meetings were
                    and whispering a word in different ears, to try and work for the right outcome.
                    So we talked to the Brits a lot. I think they played by far the most aggressive
                    and, in terms of trying to persuade Washington to move in the right direction,
                    effective diplomatic hand.</p>
                <p>This took, as I say, ten weeks, maybe it was twelve. And then one bright day Al
                    Haig went over to the White House with the policy paper and the recommended
                    strategy in southern Africa. We were doing other things, too. We were working
                    the Liberian crisis, the Libyan crisis, the Chadian crisis, a few other things.
                    But this was the number one issue on the plate. Haig went over to the White
                    House and had his conversation with the president.</p>
                <p>And I'll never forget, he came back at the end of the day and you could tell he'd
                    had a long conversation, interesting conversation. He called me upstairs. Just
                    me, he didn't call in my colleagues who were part of this review: Elliott
                    Abrams, Paul Wolfowitz, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Harvey Sicherman, others. He may have
                    talked to them separately, but he called me up, sat me down, said, “Well, Chet,
                    the president's on board. We're going to get out a policy document that will
                    confirm that this is our policy and it will have a number and so forth. I'm
                    going to tell you, Chet, the president's not too steeped on these issues, but
                    he's on board.”</p>
                <p>I don't know what took place in that room. I suppose history books will tell us,
                    but they went back and forth at it and I guess the Secretary was persuasive and
                    the President may have said, “Well, give it a shot.”</p>
                <p>I can't emphasize enough how ambitious this was, to take an inherited diplomacy
                    that was UN-based, that was supported by all the Africans, which the South
                    Africans were very skeptical of and had refused to go along with and then link
                    it to a wholly new factor, namely a strategic shift in Angola, that the Soviets
                    could block, Castro could block, the Angolans could block and then we say,
                    “We're going to launch this new thing in an allied context.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, and trying to look at it, at the time, it would have
                        sounded like a strong no-policy policy. In other words, if you're throwing
                        in the Cubans, what was in it for the Cubans to get out, or for the Soviets
                        and all of that. So, in other words, by linking it, it meant that it would
                        sound like, “Okay, we're all for you, but you have to do this,” which was an
                        unacceptable thing. At the time, did you see any real possibility of getting
                        the Cubans out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Oh, yeah, we did and of course we were bullish and hopeful and
                    optimistic, as younger people often are and we were off by a few years in
                    thinking we could get this done in 18 months!</p>
                <p>But there was something in it for the Angolan regime and for the Cubans and
                    others on that side, namely the removal of South Africa from the borders of
                    Angola, a fundamental strategic shift. Namibia's bigger than Texas. When you
                    talk about decolonizing a place bigger than Texas, you are changing the
                    strategic balance of southern Africa in a very fundamental way that's actually
                    got something in it for Luanda, for the Angolan regime and therefore for the
                    Cubans, who were their safety blanket. So, yes, there was something.</p>
                <p>It wasn't just the South African forces and their own cross-border activities
                    into Angola. It was also the South African connection to UNITA and Savimbi that
                    would be changed by the decolonization of Namibia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Namibia was really, for a sparsely settled area, big, but
                        sparsely settled, it was sort of a keystone for this whole</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Absolutely, absolutely. The first time I did consultations in the Front
                    line states, I'll never forget it, my meeting with Julius Nyerere, who was at
                    that point the president of Tanzania but also the chairman of the Front line
                    states and he sat me down and gave me a few history lessons, which was his
                    style. He was called Mwalimu for a reason, Swahili for “teacher.”</p>
                <p>He didn't like this new approach, was skeptical that we could pull it off, but he
                    also said, “Namibia is the key. Namibia comes first. We've dealt with the
                    Rhodesia-Zimbabwe problem. The next issue on the African agenda is Namibia.
                    Focus your attention on Namibia. If you can get it done, you have my
                    support.”</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>That was the nature of the message and the sequencing was so clear. Nyerere
                    understood the geopolitical reality and confirmed our own analysis. We often
                    tried to explain during the middle Eighties, when we got into deep controversies
                    over apartheid, to explain to people here that the only logical sequence was
                    Nyerere's - Namibia had to be decolonized first. You're not going to change
                    apartheid in South Africa until you've dealt with Namibia. That was the
                    sequence. He understood that. I understood it. It was essential to wind down and
                    end the cross-border, internationalized warfare first, before the internal
                    conflicts could be addressed.</p>
                <p>So, you're right. It was the keystone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can see how hard this would be to explain. Africa, for
                        most Americans, was apartheid. Why are you mucking around in this sandpile
                        over there? Why is this important?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I don't think that was the view of Americans in 1981, but it became the
                    view of Americans by 1985-86, when you had all these incredible stories coming
                    out, what with the township unrest and the actions of the South African police
                    and the resistance that was going on in the urban areas and the necklacing and
                    all that. By the mid-Eighties, that's exactly the way people saw it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the South Africans, the white South Africans,
                        sniffing around or trying to do anything? What was their attitude?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I already mentioned to you that Senator Helms tried to impose an
                    appointment on my team that would have been a direct pipeline into the South
                    African military intelligence directorate, had it happened. I have no doubt
                    about it.</p>
                <p>Yes, they were definitely sniffing around and of course in the South African
                    scheme of things they had their differences, as well. There were the uniformed
                    military. There were the line military. There were the intelligence military,
                    kind of like the Pakistani situation, sometimes. They had different voices
                    inside the military. They had civilian intelligence and they had the Department
                    of Foreign Affairs. And we were dealing with all four of them and they all four
                    had their own policies and they all four wanted to be figuring out how to work
                    Washington and how to influence Washington. So we'd have a conversation with one
                    South African voice without knowing if in fact that was getting back to the
                    other ones and were they reporting honestly and so forth.</p>
                <p>They were trying to influence us to do what they could to undo Resolution 435, or
                    to so encumber it with one-sided conditions that it would never happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought they would have been delighted adding
                        Cuba, thinking that this might be a killer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yeah, there was no question that for some, for those who never wanted to
                    see any solution, they saw this as possibly guaranteeing there'd never be one.
                    And for others, they saw it as very ambitious and it'd be great if it ever
                    happened, because they could see the upside. A Namibian settlement that they
                    could say brought about the departure of communist forces from neighboring
                    countries would be much more attractive. But that was the foreign affairs people
                    and a few in the ground forces who mainly saw it that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But were the South Africans particularly interested in
                        Namibia? It doesn't strike me as being a garden spot. I don't think any
                        South Africans live there, do they, white South Africans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: There were some, at the time, there might have been a 100,000 white
                    South Africans, but they were divided into different categories: Germans and
                    Afrikaners and others. Probably not that many, actually, but there was a very
                    active and vociferous wing of the National Party, which was affiliated with the
                    South African National Party. So that became an echo chamber for them and they
                    were very sensitive to the views of the local white minority there; “Are you
                    going to sell us out?” kind of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Canadians being in this contact group, was this just
                        the Canadians wanting a say in something or having a foreign policy, or was
                        there more to it than that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, as I said, the contact group was the Western members of the
                    Security Council at a particular moment and they hung together throughout the
                    Carter years. The question was, would they continue once Reagan came into office
                    and would they be willing, all four of them, to work with us and continue the
                    group in existence?</p>
                <p>The Canadians were probably the most skeptical, along with the French, very
                    skeptical of being joined at the hip with an American conservative approach, as
                    they would see it, to this region.</p>
                <p>So the dynamic inside the group was interesting to watch. The British were very
                    close, cooperating partners, but continuously trying to steer us in what they
                    saw as more sensible directions. The Germans, depending on which Germans you
                    talked to, if it was Chancellor Kohl's people they were with us but Genscher and
                    his Foreign Ministry people were somewhat skeptical.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>The French were a thorn in our flesh and were often critical, but they also had
                    some very good ideas and they would occasionally come up with excellent
                    initiatives. But if they didn't like what they heard from us they'd be very
                    outspoken. And the Canadians loved to watch the French in action sticking it to
                    us, and tried to copy them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You referred to the “launch.” What were you talking
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: The launch was, once you've had a policy review how do you present it to
                    the parties, how do you present it to the world, how do you begin to get
                    momentum, how do you begin to put the ball in the parties' court, because that's
                    really what a mediation initiative is.</p>
                <p>And so we probably had the policy review completed and some ground under our feet
                    by March-April of '81.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say “we,” this is</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I mean my team and I and there were a couple of other colleagues that
                    were at my level that had worked on the review, including Paul Wolfowitz,
                    Elliott Abrams, Nick Platt and George Moose, who was up in New York, working
                    with Ambassador Kirkpatrick.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which George Moose was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: George Moose who was my second successor, after Hank Cohen. George is
                    now at George Washington University. Not Dick Moose.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually, I supervised George Moose, very vaguely. I was
                        consul general in Saigon and he was up in Da Nang as a vice consul up there
                        and technically Da Nang came under my rule, very, very vaguely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: George went on to do different things and was ambassador in Benin and
                    went to become our ambassador to the Geneva-based UN agencies.</p>
                <p>When I say “we,” we had to find a way to relate the outcome of this policy review
                    to our key partners and there were two dimensions to it, of course.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>One was the contact group, that's the Brits, the French, Germans and Canadians,
                    but starting of course with the Brits (and they with us because their role in
                    life in modern times is to do the advanced toilet training of Americans; and
                    they always saw their role as reflecting a special need to both interpret us to
                    the others and to coach us, so we didn't break too much of the china that they
                    knew we were about to break.</p>
                <p>I think we really got them very anxious, because they had, at the time and still
                    do, very serious African equities and they wanted to make sure we didn't trash
                    all of them.</p>
                <p>So we would meet first with the Brits, which got the others in the contact group
                    very uneasy, because they thought we were colluding, which of course we were.
                    That's called “pre-cooking,” essential to any diplomatic launch, you've got to
                    pre-cook with the right people.</p>
                <p>And we did a fair amount of contact group work and then we agreed to take a
                    contact group mission around the Frontline states and South Africa, but not
                    until I'd made a separate trip around the region and had gone to the allies with
                    my team. So there was a staged launch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the launch and we haven't really
                        talked about constructive engagement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes, where'd it come from? That's obviously a doctrine that's now
                    enshrined and it's mainstreamed everywhere. People say, “We've got to have some
                    constructive engagement with Iran.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I actually coined a phrase, too. When Larry Eagleburger
                        and I served together in Yugoslavia, we were both involved in the aftermath
                        of the Skopje earthquake and I began to refer to him as “Lawrence of
                        Macedonia.” I've since seen references in print to this nickname for
                        Eagleburger.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back here in Washington, you were under a conservative
                        Republican administration. Was there anyone in the Republican power
                        structure who was opposed to doing anything, they liked things just the way
                        they were and didn't want to upset the white South Africans and that rule
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, within the administration there was more than one view and the
                    policy review came out right, from my perspective.</p>
                <p>We chose that middle option, which was to take that inherited policy and the
                    inherited construct of the UN resolution for Namibia's transition and link it to
                    Cuban troop withdrawal from Angola.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>That was the middle course and there were people who came along with that I'd say
                    grudgingly and would have probably been happier if we could have just sort of
                    not had a policy towards this part of the world, or had one that was basically
                    just for show.</p>
                <p>I think Jeane Kirkpatrick was somewhat reluctant to see us engaging with the
                    frontline states in order “to bring SWAPO into power.” That might have been the
                    way she would have spoken if I weren't in the room. But she went along, provided
                    we made rigorous and tough conditionality on the Angolan-Cuban side of the
                    agenda, which of course we intended to do, anyway, but she wanted reassurance on
                    that. In her view, our real friends in Africa were South Africa and Mobutu in
                    Zaire, people that you could “count on.”</p>
                <p>In that regard she was probably pretty close to some of the president's thinking.
                    Richard Allen over in the NSC probably had a somewhat skeptical view of what we
                    were doing.</p>
                <p>Al Haig took this policy construct that we developed, took it to the President
                    and in effect got his blessing. So we had the support that we needed at that
                    level.</p>
                <p>Up in Congress, of course, there was a klatch of, I'd say, nine or ten
                    conservative Republican senators who were not particularly enchanted with any of
                    this, led by Jesse Helms, who held up my nomination for six months.</p>
                <p>So some of what I was doing during this launch I was doing without confirmation.
                    I was going out there and that caused some grumbling from the ranks up in the
                    Senate: “What's Crocker doing? He's the acting assistant secretary. What's he
                    doing telling the South Africans this or the Tanzanians that, when he's not even
                    assistant secretary yet?”</p>
                <p>I wasn't the only one held up. There were a number of others: Tom Enders was held
                    up for some period of time. I think Eagleburger was held up and there were I
                    think at least two others.</p>
                <p>So, yes, there was some pushback, some blowback and one of the more interesting
                    dimensions, Helms tried to cut a deal with the State Department, with Haig,
                    basically: “All right, I'll give you Crocker, but I want to give him a senior
                    deputy that I can count on” and the senior deputy would have come off Helms'
                    staff.</p>
                <p>And we subsequently found out and I'm quite happy to put this in the history
                    books, in light of the passage of time, that the guy he wanted to put on my
                    staff as my senior deputy was actually on the South African payroll.</p>

                        of “Don't talk ill of the dead” and all that, but when you look at it, he
                        was not a benign influence.</hi>

                <p>CROCKER: Well, there was a na�vet� there which was astonishing, but, basically,
                    you have people in our political system and you always have had, on both sides
                    of the aisle, who think that their job is to make alliances with foreign
                    governments, at the expense of the policy of their own government.</p>
                <p>And whether they do it in ink, in blood, or with a handshake or with money
                    changing hands or whatever, it is an outrage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The China lobby, the Israeli lobby, almost the IRA

                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Oh, for sure, IRA lobby, big time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is nasty stuff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I occasionally would use the word treason when I was talking about these
                    things with my colleagues, but of course I'm not an attorney and I doubt very
                    much that this view would prevail in a court of law, but the point is that when
                    people are out there actively subverting what the established policy of our
                    government is, when that policy's been blessed by the president</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they're on the payroll.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, in some cases. I don't know how that occurs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'm talking about they're on the American payroll.
                        In other words, you can try to subvert any policy if you're a private
                        citizen, to a certain extent, legally, but certainly if you're working for
                        the government</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: You mean in the Congress?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, they're on the payroll.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Anyone who's gone to see Charlie Wilson's War will understand that
                    there's lots of ways to be on the payroll.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a movie about Congressman Wilson getting money for
                        the mujahideen in Pakistan and support for them, a very interesting
                        movie.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>CROCKER: So there was some pushback on the policy at home, that's true. Yes,
                    there was.</p>
                <p>One of the reasons why we had such strong support from the Brits is that they
                    understood that what we represented, “we” being my colleagues and I in the
                    African bureau and those who supported the policy within the Department of State
                    were the best they were going to get and so they didn't want us to fail, they
                    wanted to help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in a way, when Nixon used to say about Vietnam,
                        “Well, I might do anything,” which meant that people should be more anxious
                        to negotiate with you before something happened.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>And in a way, when Reagan came in, he was considered to be so far to the right
                    that a moderate, practical approach on African problems was really almost
                    surprising for many foreign observers.</p>
                <p>CROCKER: I think that there definitely were those in the British and German
                    governments, particularly, perhaps the French, who understood that point exactly
                    and rather enjoyed thinking that they were saving their equities from something
                    far 'worse' by supporting our new policy and trying to make it work.</p>
                <p>I think also their initial reaction was that it was hugely ambitious, this
                    linkage of Namibia to Angola and working with South Africa and all the frontline
                    states, trying to peel these Marxist regimes in Angola and Mozambique away from
                    Moscow, all of that was seen to be very ambitious and somewhat polarizing.</p>
                <p>But I had very, very strong support in the first year or so from Haig, who would
                    take this issue forward with the allies and the Africans, and Haig was quite a
                    guy.</p>
                <p>We all know Haig's many attributes, but one of them, for sure, was to take issues
                    like this, like the African dossier or the Central American dossier and others
                    and I've seen him do it repeatedly and 'mainstream' them, as we say in today's
                    world.</p>
                <p>He would take them to the allies and initiate an African discussion in the NATO
                    context or the quad context (France, UK and West Germany) and the allies weren't
                    used to this. They were used to being the ones themselves who would raise an
                    African regional issue and the Americans normally would be on receive mode.</p>
                <p>But Haig would take this contact group initiative right to the European allies,
                    in groups and individually, making it clear that it had his strong backing and
                    the President's backing, which was very helpful to me, gave me some air
                    cover.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>And I got a different kind of air cover once Haig left office. George Shultz gave
                    me also fabulous air cover, both in Washington and with allies, continuing to
                    reinforce the message.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, were you able to accomplish much prior to
                        being confirmed? I imagine you would have to kind of watch your step, that
                        you weren't making commitments or getting too far out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes, there were some tricky patches there. At one stage and this was
                    before confirmation I was in South Africa and in Mozambique and in both cases
                    the media kind of set me up and there was one meeting I didn't get in South
                    Africa and that became page one in the Washington Times.</p>
                <p>They were playing it back to Helms and making a little echo chamber and feedback
                    loop out of it from the South African press to the American conservative
                    press.</p>
                <p>In another case, we had a bad meeting in Mozambique where I kind of stood up
                    after the foreign minister stood up and we walked out of the meeting and it was
                    very abrupt and it was not a successful meeting. Mozambicans had not yet drunk
                    the Kool-Aid of constructive engagement and that became page one.</p>
                <p>So there were some moments like that which seemed like, “Gosh, is Crocker really
                    in trouble,” that kind of stuff, would be the buzz back here in Washington.</p>
                <p>And then came the leaks. There were a series of leaks, which led to much
                    speculation that came out I think in April, maybe May, of '81 that were leaked
                    documents that came out of the African bureau and they had to do with meetings
                    that we were having with the South African foreign minister, who was visiting
                    Washington in May of '81.</p>
                <p>These were the kind of scene setter briefing memos prepared for Secretary for
                    this visit and included the regional negotiations on Angola-Namibia, it included
                    the bilateral relationship and what would constructive engagement mean
                    bilaterally and it included the nuclear relationship with South Africa and
                    whether we could find a way to get them into a deal for constructive delivery of
                    some reprocessed material from their reactors, in exchange for them signing up
                    to the NPT and IAEA safeguards and so forth.</p>
                <p>In any event, those leaks were obviously orchestrated and the question in my mind
                    particularly was who was doing this, because you would not have thought of the
                    Southern African office of the Bureau of African Affairs as a hotbed of right
                    wingers and therefore was it a hotbed of left wingers? The leaks came out of
                    TransAfrica, which is obviously an activist, left-oriented lobby movement which
                    was somewhat hostile to our policies.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>But it seemed like an unholy alliance, because the leaks were used to try and
                    undercut me and they were used by the conservatives to undercut me, but the
                    leaks were published by TransAfrica, so I had to ask myself who was helping whom
                    in this whole process here?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever find out who was leaking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well my sense is it probably came from some low-level disgruntled
                    persons in the Bureau who were in touch with TransAfrica, but it was exploited
                    very skillfully by the right; in fact, it could just as easily have come from
                    skeptical adversaries in other bureaus who were privy to those briefing
                    papers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anybody who leaks, it's not much fun to have them around
                        at meetings and all that. Did you find yourself holding back? I'm just
                        trying to get a feel for the office.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: It led to a degree of sensitivity, of concern, even of paranoia. We had
                    some locks changed in the safes in certain offices, because I was at one point
                    thinking that this might have been a break-in, so to speak, orchestrated by
                    folks on the conservative side, because they were the ones who were having the
                    most fun with the results, they were the ones who were trying to block my
                    confirmation and undercut our policies.</p>
                <p>But I guess it's just a bit of stretch, looking back on it, to actually believe
                    that there'd be a Watergate-style break-in into the safes of the Southern
                    African office and then that these conservative activists would have handed the
                    documents to TransAfrica is also a bit of a stretch.</p>
                <p>But sometimes you have a coalition of forces that are on opposite poles who
                    exploit things for their own domestic purposes, so to speak and it serves each
                    of their interests. We were not popular on the left or the right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How you were seeing yourself being portrayed in sort of
                        the general press, the New York Times, the Washington Post and the
                        columnists? Were you considered to be a right wing ideologue or a
                        compromiser or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: You'd have to go back and look at the coverage of people who were
                    writing at the time. I think I was looked at towards the end of '81 as a
                    ambitious and perhaps somewhat naive but very pragmatic person who was a realist
                    Kissinger tradition, 'cause I was and I am.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>I think they saw that and they understood the pressures that I was under. They
                    understood that the kind of engagement we were proposing, which would include
                    South Africa, but not only South Africa, was going to be anathema on the hard
                    left. And they understood that the hard decisions we were putting in front of
                    South Africa would be anathema to the hard right. So they eventually came to see
                    it as an ambitious, centrist policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were coming up with the launch of your policy,
                        was it spelled out to sort of the general public or to the people you were
                        negotiating with or was this something that you were dealing one card at a
                        time and keeping the rest of the cards hidden?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: We gave a lot of speeches in '81 and '82 at various fora and we
                    testified a lot, so the record was pretty clear about the general approach,
                    namely, that we were going to offer a comprehensive diplomatic alternative to
                    military solutions in Southern Africa and that meant seeking political
                    accommodation between South Africa and its neighbors over Namibia and Angola
                    and, for that matter, within South Africa, because the alternative was
                    revolution, the alternative was armed violence and we represented a constructive
                    alternative to the Soviet approach that favored armed struggle, confrontation
                    and so forth.</p>
                <p>We laid all that out in speeches. I spoke to the American Legion annual meeting
                    in Hawaii, I testified umpteen times in Congress on this. So that record was
                    clear and so was the point of how we were going to continue on Namibia, but in
                    practice there was going to have to be a relationship, a link, between getting
                    Cubans out of Angola and getting South Africans out of Namibia.</p>
                <p>We did not spell out, to answer your question, we did not spell out the terms of
                    that linkage, because we couldn't. We hadn't negotiated it yet and we certainly
                    didn't want to negotiate it in public.</p>
                <p>That was the key thing that took years: what was the relationship here. Does
                    South Africa go first and then Angola, Cuba, Russia and so on look and see what
                    South Africa has done, what it has to do, so maybe we can do something? Or it is
                    that the communist powers have to go first, as the South Africans would say and
                    then we South Africans will look and see if they're serious and then maybe we'll
                    do something on Namibia.</p>
                <p>The media had fun with this, as you can imagine. What exactly is linkage - is it
                    legal? Is linkage doctrinal? Is it theological?</p>
                <p>I remember Al Haig at one point was asked at a press briefing to be a little more
                    specific about what kind of link there would have to be between Cuban troop
                    withdrawal and Resolution 435 on Namibia and he said, in a classic Haigian
                    phrase, “There'll have to be some degree of empirical simultaneity.” And that
                    was translated into lots of languages, I'm sure.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your reading, as you made these initial tours,
                        about, well, first, the situation on the ground? Was this just the right
                        time to begin this, do you think? Had governments reached essentially a
                        stalemate, would you say? Were they ready for something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: When you say “they,”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking about the various countries involved and the ANC
                        and other groups.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, first, the allies were ready for it, because they were desperate
                    for a continued peace process in Southern Africa. This is classic European
                    diplomacy here. It isn't that they were desperate for an outcome. They were
                    desperate for a process.</p>
                <p>They wanted to be able to say, every time they met each other and their own
                    publics and their parliaments and so on, “We are involved in a peace process
                    that is ongoing and we had meetings and we're going to have more meetings.”</p>
                <p>So in that sense it was timely. As far as individual countries in Southern Africa
                    are concerned, it would depend on which country.</p>
                <p>I think in the case of Mozambique they were beginning to understand that the
                    Soviet embrace and the hostility of South Africa were putting them between a
                    rock and a hard place. They were beginning to understand that they needed to
                    figure a way to escape the box they were in.</p>
                <p>But they didn't trust us at all and they were unfortunately inclined to believe
                    that what South Africa's radio said about us was true, that we were in bed with
                    South Africa.</p>
                <p>So we had to demonstrate time and time again that that was not the case. But
                    Mozambique was getting ready.</p>
                <p>I think we probably exaggerated the extent to which South Africa was ready. There
                    were some people in the South African structure who were ready and who saw this
                    as an interesting approach, this linkage on Namibia-Angola. And the broader
                    construct, too, which is that if you do well on Namibia-Angola, we'll cooperate
                    with you more broadly, they understood that.</p>
                <p>There were others and this gets a little bit complicated, who thought that they
                    could outmaneuver and outlast Crocker and his team in the State Department and
                    that they could work through White House channels and CIA channels to
                    outmaneuver the State Department. And they would prefer to speak directly to
                    Bill Casey or directly to Ronald Reagan.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>And so we've spent years, actually, putting out that fire and dealing with that
                    threat to policy coherence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With Reagan, could they get to him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well it would depend on the specific time. At one stage, for example,
                    Judge Clark, who had been deputy secretary, went over and became NSC advisor.
                    That was not a brilliant success.</p>
                <p>But the South Africans thought that they had a friend in Judge Clark. They
                    thought he was a friend and that he represented Ronald Reagan.</p>
                <p>So for a while they would try to go to him and go around us, but it depends
                    pretty much on the month, which device they might use. Obviously we had a
                    liaison relationship with the South African intelligence services and so the
                    Agency had the potential for its own freelancing and its own channels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to monitor it, or were you able to speak
                        frankly to the Agency here in Washington and say, “Don't undercut me, this
                        is policy,” or were you concerned about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I was concerned about it throughout the period of Bill Casey's tenure,
                    because we had pretty regular evidence that there were conversations being held
                    and things being said and analyses being prepared that represented an effort by
                    US officials in other places to undercut and change our policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were they coming from and sort of what was in it for
                        them, was this ideological or was this perceived interests of the U.S., or
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, you have to read Persico's book on Casey, which has a wonderful
                    quote in the early chapters about the recruitment of Bill Casey to the Reagan
                    Administration. At a certain point Casey got a phone call from Reagan offering
                    him the Agency and Casey's reply was, “Well, Mr. President, if I can't have the
                    State Department, I guess I could do it.”</p>
                <p>So you knew what that implied. What Bill wanted was, he wanted to destroy the
                    Evil Empire by bleeding it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Keep jabbing at it, all over the world.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes, in a sense, he wanted to go after Marxist clients of Moscow's and
                    have a war in which we subverted them in every region and maybe in some regions
                    several wars.</p>
                <p>The main case in point being Nicaragua and Afghanistan, but he got very involved
                    in the UNITA account and his people did, very involved, because they were in
                    touch with UNITA courtesy of the South African Defense Forces and South African
                    military intelligence.</p>
                <p>So there was a kind of a network there that we had to contend with that was
                    talking to each other all the time, we knew they were talking to each other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this mean that as you were reforming your policy, as
                        time goes on and it changes, that reports coming out of the Agency were not
                        viewed as being overly accurate and viewed with some suspicion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: By us?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: That was certainly true. It would depend on, again, precise
                    circumstances, but there would be a tendency to describe Jonas Savimbi and UNITA
                    and their frame of mind in ways that suggested they lacked confidence in the
                    diplomacy of the Department of State. You can sort of see where that was
                    heading, right - reports implying Savimbi is suspicious of the regional
                    diplomacy.</p>
                <p>And over in Mozambique there would be a tendency always to say that RENAMO, the
                    anti-regime movement that had been created by Rhodesian intelligence and funded
                    by South African military intelligence, was in fact anti-communist freedom
                    fighters who were going to bring Jesus to Mozambique.</p>
                <p>Well, there was a tendency to paint that war, the military balance there, as
                    leading to the inevitable victory of the insurgents and the defeat of the
                    incumbent government. So we had to deal with that kind of reporting all the
                    time. The punch was spiked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This gives a feel for diplomacy as it really is. Three
                        fourths of the battles are probably fought in Washington and one fourth with
                        the countries abroad. And particularly if it's a controversial issue] and I
                        can't think of a harder one. And this is in a way fought in the full light
                        of day, as these things go, with the media and all, all the powers that be
                        in Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, the first four years of this effort were under a lower profile. It
                    began to blow up in our faces around late '84 and early '85, into '86, because
                    of events within South Africa, but also because as South Africa began to
                    experience serious domestic urban unrest there was a leftwing, liberal backlash
                    against the Administration and our African efforts,, and then there developed a
                    conservative backlash against us as well.</p>
                <p>So we were being told on the one side “You shouldn't be dealing with those evil
                    racists Boers in Pretoria” and on the other side we were being told “You
                    shouldn't deal with those Marxist slimeballs in Luanda and Maputo.”</p>
                <p>So we were being in a sense attacked from both flanks. It was difficult to keep
                    the ship moving on its course. And, as you say, it was very much an intramural
                    scrum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Quite recently I've been interviewing somebody who was
                        saying that he'd never been on a stronger team than when he was working in
                        the African bureau with you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>It sounds like although you had some of your people maybe leaking, but basically
                    you had a pretty strong team, didn't you, in the African bureau?</p>
                <p>CROCKER: We had a very strong team. I was fortunate to inherit a couple of very
                    able deputies and to be able to bring on a couple more.</p>
                <p>And one of the things I learned was that if you don't play the personnel game in
                    the State Department then you're not going to be an effective assistant
                    secretary, and you've got to play the personnel game proactively, especially if
                    you're dealing with Africa, because not everybody necessarily is thinking that's
                    where they want to serve.</p>
                <p>But in practice you can get good people to come and work in the African terrain,
                    because there's lots of opportunities. Provided they perceive that we have a
                    serious policy approach and are not just serving time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Careerwise, it's very good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: So we recruited a hell of a lot of good people this way and we did it
                    because I had good people working with me who could do the recruitment and
                    communication side during the bid process.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>It wasn't that I could do it personally. They didn't know me, necessarily, but
                    the fact that I had people of the caliber of Jim Bishop and Princeton Lyman and
                    Lannon Walker and Frank Wisner and Roy Stacy and so on working with me
                    throughout this period and Ken Brown, who came in after Jim Bishop moved on.
                    These are world-class officers.</p>
                <p>The word spread and so we got office directors of that caliber and we were able
                    to get outstanding people like the late Bob Frasure to come and be the Namibia
                    desk officer and be my right hand person on the negotiations for the first two
                    or three years and then we placed him as our political counselor in London,
                    working the Brits on behalf of the policy.</p>
                <p>That kind of assignment process became extremely important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that I note is that in so many cases
                        people I've talked to who served in Africa as ambassadors there have felt
                        that they weren't getting much support, not getting much initiative or
                        something from their European colleagues. But here, I take it, in this you
                        really had the Europeans, the major powers, engaged?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: We had to. We had in effect to borrow leverage and we had to mobilize an
                    allied network. It was a very 24/7 kind of a thing.</p>
                <p>For those eight years, I was in the office, with a bunch of people, every
                    Saturday and many of us never got home before eight o'clock on weekday nights
                    and those who got involved with this policy worked those kinds of hours.</p>
                <p>And if you don't take it from me, ask them. They'll tell you we worked those
                    kinds of hours.</p>
                <p>So what we were doing during all that time was not just sitting there reading
                    cables. It was actually thinking up ideas and trying to launch trial balloons -
                    e.g., and trying to mobilize someone in Brazil to weigh in with the Portuguese
                    about the way they were profiled in Africa.</p>
                <p>Or trying to figure out some side channel that would get us to a better
                    interlocutor in Luanda or writing cables that in effect were asking the British
                    Embassy in Angola to go in and make a demarche on our behalf, because we had no
                    official relations and no presence there.</p>
                <p>We conducted our policy, in many ways, with and through allies. We had a kind of
                    full court, man-to-man coverage out there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the African embassies here in Washington
                        were effective, or not, or did you pretty well have to go to the governments
                        themselves?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>CROCKER: You can't generalize. There were at that time a handful of African
                    ambassadors in town who were very, very, well chosen, very capable people, who
                    did report back to their home base.</p>
                <p>But in other cases there were people who just were timeservers, I guess you'd
                    say, they were involved in the diplomatic circuit, doing whatever people do on
                    the diplomatic circuit in Washington, going to events and representing their
                    country on the Hill or whatever, or maybe playing the real estate market, who
                    knows?</p>
                <p>There certainly was quite a range and in general we worked in capitals and at
                    pretty high levels. Governments in Africa make decisions at high levels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Often when I talk to people who served in Africa, they say
                        “If you want to get something done you really have to see the
                        president.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Or the national security advisor, if there is one. Or the defense
                    minister, the interior minister, foreign minister, whatever.</p>
                <p>Again, you know your personalities country by country, but it's pretty high level
                    stuff. And when I would go on missions, which I would do a lot and so did my
                    colleagues, with or without me, we would get received at high levels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Essentially how would you describe constructive
                        engagement, when you started? I assume it changed as circumstances and time
                        went on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: It morphed in several ways. When I first wrote about it, in a piece in
                    Foreign Affairs, it was in the context of describing the possibility for an
                    alternative relationship with South Africa.</p>
                <p>In that piece, as I said, part of that relationship would have to be based on the
                    regional dynamics of Southern Africa. In other words, we couldn't isolate South
                    African from Southern Africa. It was the regional hegemon and one of the terms
                    for our engagement would have to be their cooperation on regional issues.</p>
                <p>But I talked a lot in that article about how there was a possibility that the
                    current South African government of the day could be nudged to becoming a
                    piecemeal reformist, in which reform measures would be taken that would
                    gradually develop some momentum and gradually lead to perhaps unintended
                    consequences of open ended change. “Negotiated change away from apartheid” was
                    the terminology I used.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>Now that's the article and of course having written that article it's been hung
                    around my neck ever sense and was while I was in office.</p>
                <p>And that's the way it is. If you're stupid enough to write articles and then go
                    into public life, you live with them!</p>
                <p>Once in office and we had all these policy reviews, it became very clear to
                    everyone and especially to me that the focus of energy was going to be to get
                    the regional conflicts wound down first, before one could directly address and
                    expect major moves away from apartheid to a system of one man one vote in South
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>And I began to push that line and to believe it and it was not difficult to
                    believe. Logically, you can't ask, for example, Angola to settle with UNITA
                    while there are South African forces intervening inside Angola and Cuban forces
                    protecting the regime in Angola. You can't ask the government of Mozambique the
                    same question about RENAMO while there are South Africans running across their
                    own countryside providing clandestine support to their enemies.</p>
                <p>And in the South African case, you couldn't really expect the South Africans to
                    negotiate with the ANC when the ANC is sitting in communist-supplied military
                    training camps in neighboring countries such as Angola.</p>
                <p>What you're doing when you do that is asking people to negotiate highly sensitive
                    matters - as one Angolan put it to m'with foreigners in their kitchen'. And so
                    the logic of the policy was, “Let's deal with the regional challenges and get
                    them under control,” which means negotiated solutions: Angola, Namibia,
                    Mozambique and that will create the conditions in which all these countries,
                    including South Africa, are able to deal with their fundamental domestic
                    challenges.</p>
                <p>So that's how it evolved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what about the Soviets at this time? Were they
                        beginning to pull in their horns? They would obviously be opposed and would
                        be trying to have their boys win the wars.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: And their clients to survive. And they were trying very hard. This
                    became interesting, because in the case of Zimbabwe's new leadership, which had
                    been, if anything, China-oriented, not Russian-oriented and the Russians were
                    very anxious to make up for that lost ground. So our job in Zimbabwe was to fill
                    the chairs by supporting this new government, even though it was rather radical,
                    in order to keep the Soviets out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But how about the Chinese?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>CROCKER: They were okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were okay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: They weren't going to challenge our global position, particularly, at
                    that stage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they could build the TanZam Railway and they could do
                        other things</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: And they could tweak the Soviet nose and they could outmaneuver the
                    Soviets in certain areas.</p>
                <p>So Robert Mugabe, back then, this is going back a long time ago, was somebody
                    that wound up with many offers from Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, the
                    Chinese and lots of other people, in order to keep the Russians out and to keep
                    the South Africans from trying to destabilize this new Zimbabwe government.</p>
                <p>So in every country we had this kind of dynamic to think about. In the case of
                    Mozambique it was a little different.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Soviets were</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Not happy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they were an active player. This wasn't a matter of
                        saying, “Well, Africa isn't worth it” and getting out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: No, but what was interesting was that they were playing a very active
                    diplomatic hand and trying to bedevil us in the UN Security Council and trying
                    to destroy the Cuban linkage by having resolutions passed or helpful ones
                    defeated in New York that made our job awkward.</p>
                <p>And they were very good at that. They had a lot of well trained lawyers and
                    drafters, both East Germans and Russians, who would be busy working the
                    corridors and the delegates' lounge in New York and buying people lunch and
                    whatever they were doing, lots of money I'm sure changed hands, in order to try
                    and keep the African frontline states from working with us. We had a problem
                    with the Soviets on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Jeane Kirkpatrick, who you say wasn't quite
                        wild about what you were up to, but she was our UN ambassador and obviously
                        violently opposed to the Soviets. Was she able to protect that UN flank or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yeah, as she could and she would often do it by trying to mobilize other
                    Africans whom we weren't working with as much, the Francophones, particularly,
                    because the Francophones weren't part of the frontline states. But we could use
                    all the help we could get, so having help from Senegal and C�te d'Ivoire and
                    Zaire and other places was useful.</p>
                <p>But you can't challenge, under African diplomatic theology, you couldn't
                    challenge the specific role of the frontline states. That was an OAU
                    doctrine.</p>
                <p>So we had to work with the frontline states and some of them were extremely
                    competent and they saw that the Soviets were playing a spoiler's game. They
                    understood it, most of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There wasn't much in it for them with the Soviets.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: No, all they could get from the Soviets was military aid. And the only
                    ones who really wanted to stay close to the Soviets and were scared of their
                    shadows was the MPLA regime in Angola and they were very, very much in the
                    Soviets' clutches and it took us a lot of work to break them free from that. We
                    didn't really break them free, probably, until the late Eighties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Cubans a puppet of the Soviets, or were they
                        pretty much playing their own game?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I don't think Castro ever was comfortable being anyone's puppet. He
                    certainly wasn't going to be our puppet.</p>
                <p>But he didn't like having Big Brother push him around and dictate the policy and
                    as time went on we could sense that the Cuban view of Angola was somewhat
                    nuanced and different from the Russian view of Angola. Towards the end of the
                    Eighties, I'm getting way ahead of myself here, we figured out how to play that
                    and how to exploit that difference and how to mobilize Cuban interest in a deal,
                    which the Soviets really didn't come to appreciate.</p>
                <p>At the very end of our process, the Soviets had to get onto a moving train. The
                    Cubans were already on that train, before the Soviets were.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>But in the early Eighties, at the launch phase we're talking about, I had no way
                    to talk to the Cubans. We didn't have much conversation with the Cubans,
                    excepting about Nicaragua. We did have Vernon Walters going down and telling to
                    Castro to stop it in Central America, but we weren't talking with him about
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>Now looking back, I could say to you, with hindsight, today, it might have been
                    worth our while to reach out to the Cubans much earlier.</p>
                <p>But whether it would have worked, whether the Soviets would have permitted it to
                    work, is another question, because the Soviets were actively countering us and
                    doing a lot of things to try and sow distrust against our policies in different
                    African capitals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any effort on the part, say, of the European
                        bureau or the Soviet desk or something to try to do anything with the
                        Soviets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Directly?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes, there were a few. I think Haig started this idea. He would sit down
                    with Gromyko on the margins of the UNGA in the fall of the year, I guess Haig
                    was only there for one UNGA, but I remember he did have one meeting in which
                    there was some discussion of the Southern African issue, but it was very much
                    signal sending about how America is back and you're not going to get a free ride
                    and exploit these troubled African countries and we have alternatives that the
                    Africans are listening to.</p>
                <p>And then the Soviets would come back with their scripture and their theology and
                    so it wasn't very productive.</p>
                <p>In succeeding years, with of course the cooperation of the European bureau, we
                    would from time to time have U.S.-Soviet exchanges about African issues, with an
                    interlocutor that I came to know, several, actually, pretty well and these
                    exchanges were fairly sterile.</p>
                <p>They were exchanges of positions, with lots of references to UN texts and lots of
                    references to international law and to the charter of the OAU and to the history
                    of the negotiations and so forth. It was doctrinal stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Once you get into that particular aspect of diplomacy it
                        means that nothing's going to happen, when you're quoting references to each
                        other.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>CROCKER: Yeah, you're reading your talking points and you're actually talking for
                    the note takers, so they can take it home again: “And then I told him ....”</p>
                <p>The one part of the constructive engagement story that I haven't touched on is
                    that the South African government, for domestic as well as international
                    reasons, chose to take constructive engagement and redefine it their way - in
                    their favor - and then get South African Broadcasting Corporation on the
                    airwaves 24/7 asserting “We have a new policy. We have a new president in
                    Washington. He understands the problem and we have an ally in the fight against
                    communist aggression in Africa and we're defining this new relations ship and
                    Crocker is coming” and creating an aura which was very difficult for us to
                    contend with, framing things to look like we jumped into bed with one country's
                    government, which was not the policy at all.</p>
                <p>So the words constructive engagement were hammered into the minds and the ears of
                    many, many Africans for eight years by South African Broadcasting Corporation,
                    which we didn't have an equivalent channel to correct the record.</p>
                <p>So that was part of the imagery of constructive engagement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's still there, too. Looking back, for most people
                        constructive engagement is seen in a very positive light, but I've heard
                        other people say, “That disastrous constructive engagement policy.” I think
                        they're referring to the conception that this represents the Reagan
                        Administration coming in and supporting white rule.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Which is absolute rubbish. First of all, constructive engagement worked.
                    Secondly, by the time P.W. Botha and I stopped talking to each other, he was
                    saying to me that he would rather deal with Jimmy Carter, because at least he
                    knew where Carter was coming from. “You seem to have your own agenda,” he said.
                    So we were obviously upsetting the South African establishment in lots of ways,
                    destabilizing them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But looking at sort of the diplomacy of this, we didn't
                        have a good tool to counter the South African broadcasts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, we used what we could use and we kept on saying, “Look, this is
                    not an engagement with South Africa. It's an engagement with all of the
                    countries and parties in Southern Africa who want to engage with us to create
                    negotiated political solutions to the region's problems.”</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>That was the one sentence answer, but people would rather believe devil theory,
                    much rather believe it, because it's so simple and clear and of course it made
                    for a good bumper sticker, once the sanctions movement got mobilized in the
                    mid-Eighties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, let's talk about confirmation. How'd the
                        process work for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, I had my hearing several months after I started doing the job.
                    Chuck Percy was there, Jesse Helms was there, Chris Dodd was there, Paul
                    Tsongas. Quite a few of my staff were there, my family, my wife and several
                    daughters were there. They were fairly young at the time but they were in middle
                    school, so they wanted to see Dad getting confirmed.</p>
                <p>It was pretty congenial, but Helms, in his typical fashion, when he got the
                    floor, when he got the floor, he said, “Now, Mr. Crocker, I'm sure when you go
                    home at night that your wife and children are glad to see you and your dog wags
                    its tail but I have some questions about whether you are the man carry out the
                    president's policies” and then the questions proceeded: “What do you think about
                    the ANC?” and “Why should the government of South Africa have to negotiate with
                    people who are allies of the Soviet Union?” and “What do you mean in your
                    Foreign Affairs article about open-ended change? Towards what, Mr. Crocker?”
                    Those kinds of questions.</p>
                <p>And that was followed by I think 103 written questions that came to the bureau
                    that we had to answer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which has always been typical of his staff, hasn't it and
                        often followed by another set of questions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: That's right, so it takes a little time and then there may be some
                    follow-up questions and so on. But the basic technique, back then, as it is now,
                    was to put a hold on the nomination. And he got several other of his colleagues
                    to put holds, so that you couldn't just lift one hold, you had to negotiate and
                    so forth.</p>
                <p>That's when the Seventh Floor began trying to free up these holds on various
                    people and trying to figure out what the terms would be for lifting the holds.
                    It's almost like a negotiation that takes place.</p>
                <p>I got a call from Al Haig saying, “Senator Helms is really kind of concerned
                    about your senior deputy,” who was a carryover from when Dick Moose was
                    Assistant Secretary for Carter, “And he's got just the guy” and he gave me the
                    name.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>So I thought for a minute, I called him and I said, “Al, you know, in my view
                    Lannon Walker is a very, very distinguished and accomplished and well qualified
                    Foreign Service Officer. He's not going to stay forever, because he is a
                    carryover and we're going to recruit for a successor for Lannon. But if that's
                    the terms for a deal — that we have to take this guy that's on Helms' staff to
                    be my senior deputy, I don't want this job, Al. Not on those terms. “</p>
                <p>Haig was quite taken aback by that. “Boy, you are stubborn, Crocker, you are
                    stubborn.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you know the staff member? Was he a known figure?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I knew the name, but it was a little bit later that I became aware of
                    the fact that we had information in other channels that he had been a contractor
                    with a South African agency.</p>
                <p>But at that point it wasn't that specific issue that made me resist. It was that
                    I wasn't going to be put in the position of trying to work with somebody who'd
                    be a spoiler, a wrecking ball, within my own ranks.</p>
                <p>I was building a team. I was going to work with my team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Helms' technique. John Bolton was put in. And
                        these people really were spoilers when they got to a place, they would carry
                        on their own policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Indeed, it could happen. I'm not familiar with the precise circumstances
                    of when and how Bolton went in initially, 'cause he came into the Baker-Bush
                    administration after I'd left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His general reputation, he sort of carried on his own
                        policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: But I think you've seen that in lots of situations, or at least some
                    situations, where people who are distrustful or where you have a real chaotic
                    situation at the interagency level, people will use that chaos to conduct
                    independent policies.</p>
                <p>And these days, with Blackberries, you can just sit there in your office in some
                    executive agency and conduct your own diplomacy with foreign counterparts and
                    nobody knows what the hell you're doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A Blackberry being a form of telephone communication, you
                        can write and all that with it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>CROCKER: Yeah, you can text message the foreign minister of a country that you
                    are in touch with in order to say, “Oh, by the way, so and so is coming to visit
                    you, but don't pay any attention to him, because he doesn't speak for the
                    president, I do.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, boy! But eventually you were confirmed. Had Haig or
                        your team given on anything, particularly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: No. I think the process served to put in place in the consciousness of
                    everybody concerned what some of the redlines or what some of the concerns were
                    of the conservative elements. I guess the only price that was paid was that we
                    became a little more sensitized to where we might expect pushback and blowback
                    in the future.</p>
                <p>And we also, I think, became much more aware of the intimate relationship between
                    the South African military intelligence operation in Pretoria and the office of
                    Senator Jesse Helms and others in Washington.</p>
                <p>And it soon became clear that those others included the Agency (CIA). And whether
                    they were all talking together in a great big round robin I don't know, but I do
                    know that DMI, as we called it, was playing it own diplomacy in Washington that
                    was distinct from that of the South African foreign minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say, sometimes, say with Pakistan today,
                        the Pakistani military intelligence service to be carrying out its own
                        foreign policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>We haven't talked much about, as you took over, how did you see the South African
                    establishment, according to the issues that you were concerned with?</p>
                <p>CROCKER: You had the security ministries, the power ministries or departments,
                    would be of course foreign affairs and the civilian NIS, the National
                    Intelligence Service, which was headed by a young academic by the name of Neil
                    Barnard, who had actually at one stage applied for doctoral studies at
                    Georgetown in order to study non-proliferation issues and whether there was
                    anything that could be done to stop additional countries from going nuclear,
                    which, of course, the South Africans were in the process of doing at the time,
                    which was very amusing.</p>
                <p>Anyway, you had the National Intelligence Service; you had the office of the
                    president itself, the state president's office and there were a number of
                    personalities in that office; and then there was the military.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>Within the military, there were probably three voices of note: there was military
                    intelligence, which was the kind of ideological hardliners who prepared the
                    briefing papers for the state president of South Africa and therefore played the
                    role that Bill Casey would like to have played with Ronald Reagan, monopolizing
                    the inputs to him.</p>
                <p>Then you had the line military, the people who actually ran military commands,
                    like they ran the joint forces command on the border between Namibia and Angola,
                    people like the chief of army staff.</p>
                <p>And then you had the special forces people, who were doing a lot of the special
                    ops in places like Mozambique and you had the defense minister. Those are at
                    least four different military voices with different views.</p>
                <p>We made it our purpose to try and understand those relationships and try to
                    figure out how to play them. They of course were trying to play us, but we tried
                    to be as good at least, if not better, at playing them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you able, as time progressed, to get the CIA to
                        start working on their counterparts to promote our policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: It's a good question. We learned and it became came clear to us that
                    speaking to a foreign government of a significant regional power exclusively as
                    the African bureau in the State Department had its limits and that it would
                    serve our purposes from time to time to broaden our base bureaucratically and to
                    bring in additional voices, you might say some pinch hitters, some heavy hitters
                    from other parts of our bureaucracy.</p>
                <p>So we would bring in NSC people. At one point Bud Macfarlane played a critical
                    role in helping us to reach out to the Angolans, hosted a dinner and things of
                    that kind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bud Macfarlane at that time was national security
                        advisor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: He was, at that time. We worked with the OSD civilian people and with
                    the CIA analytical people to put together briefings for visiting South African
                    delegations on what the Russians were doing in the Third World generally, in
                    order to give the South Africans a little bit of ground truth.</p>
                <p>It was on the one hand like a gesture of confidence building, because we were
                    doing in effect an intelligence exchange and they had intel people with them and
                    we had ours.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>So it could be looked at as a gesture, if you like, but our purpose was to reduce
                    their provincial isolation when it came to who was going to prevail in the wars
                    of the region and whether there would in fact be any winners.</p>
                <p>We made clear that there was really no limit to the amount of military junk the
                    Soviets would sell for almost nothing to the Angolans and their factories were
                    not running out of anything.</p>
                <p>And the purpose there was to point out that they were basically, the South
                    Africans, in a strategic stalemate. They were dealing on the other side with
                    both a failing African government, but also with the other superpower and they'd
                    better be aware of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the ANC? Were they part of the equation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, it depends what time period we're talking about. They were not
                    part of the equation for the first half of the Eighties, no. We obviously were
                    aware of who they were and where they we were, but we began a very low profile
                    process of reaching out to them through our embassy in Zambia in '83-'84.</p>
                <p>When I would go on a tour of the frontline states I had somebody with me, a very
                    trusted officer who was in fact kind of my intelligence guy on my own team and
                    he would, with the help of our embassy, including our station and the British
                    station, make contact with the ANC locally.</p>
                <p>And we were doing this basically on our own bat. We were not instructed. We
                    thought it was probably useful for the ANC to hear from us and not from SABC
                    what our policy was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, was the calculation that if you did it on your
                        own and sort of a briefing, somebody who was not you could peel off and go
                        over and have a talk and all, this makes sense, because Washington being
                        sort of the fishbowl it is, if this got into the hands of the press or the
                        wrong hands, it'd be played up. We had these restrictions on not talking to
                        the PLO and obviously at times we did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: But we were determined to prevent there being a parallel to that Middle
                    Eastern example. So we started at a very low level, so we could then say, three
                    years later, to Secretary Shultz, “By the ways, Mr. Secretary, we've kept in
                    touch with these guys over the years. We know who they are. In fact, we have a
                    dialogue with them. We haven't had it at your level, but what about if I went
                    and talked with them?”</p>
                <p>So, by the time we got to '86, '87 he said, “Yeah, why don't you?” So then we
                    went up to my level and I saw them, Oliver Tambo and Thabo Mbeki, in London and
                    that was okay. So we proceeded incrementally.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, what's coming through is, to operate in Washington,
                        you have to be able to play three dimensional chess. It's a complicated
                        business.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Again, we're talking about the early years, were you having problems with sort of
                    the influential media? There's the Washington Times and all, they're kind of,
                    let's say, Jesse Helms' instrument or something. But what about the New York
                    Times and the Post and maybe a couple of other papers? Were they giving you
                    support, or were they questioning? How did you find them?</p>
                <p>CROCKER: I would say for the first two or three years of this policy we did a
                    fair amount of briefing after various missions and we'd go down to the press
                    room and do a briefing.</p>
                <p>The press spokesman would say, “Now I'm very pleased to present Assistant
                    Secretary Crocker, just returned from an important trip to Africa and he wants
                    to tell you all about it” and we would have those. And we got fairly straight
                    coverage, I would say.</p>
                <p>And the Washington Times as well as anyone who was accredited could be there,
                    including of course foreign media.</p>
                <p>But from the mainstream establishment liberal press, as they're called today, the
                    kind of pushback that we'd get mainly is, “Crocker, we've heard this briefing
                    now about six times. Are you really making any progress? Do you really believe
                    that South Africans are serious, or do you really think the Soviets will let the
                    Angolans get rid of the Cuban troops? What is the evidence that we're making
                    headway towards a linkage-based Namibia settlement? You've told us this can be
                    done within a couple of years. How many more missions will this take?”</p>
                <p>We'd get that kind of a hearing. But once we got into much choppier seas in '84,
                    '85, '86 and so on, we made a regular practice of having sundowners, as we
                    called them, that's a Southern African expression, having drinks in my office
                    with 15 or 18 journalists and a couple of my people and just saying, “I'm happy
                    to tell you where I think things are. There's some controversial issues out
                    there, so have at me and we'll talk” and we'd go for an hour and a half.</p>
                <p>That was probably a good thing to do, because we would include the Washington
                    Times and so on and they would feel like they were not being isolated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were doing this, making the rounds and all, did you
                        feel that there was progress, or was this a matter of really chipping away
                        and hoping a crack will appear, or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, we phased it and again, I don't know how detailed we are going to
                    be in this interview! This is an eight year process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the early period in general.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Put it into three periods, maybe, early, middle and late.</p>
                <p>We phased the rollout of the new initiative, let's call it the linkage-based
                    Namibia-Angola settlement process. The first phase was to get some agreement on
                    things that would need to be fixed or changed or modified at the edges
                    concerning the inherited Resolution 435, the UN settlement plan for Namibia.</p>
                <p>You could say it was chipping away, because what it was doing was adding a couple
                    of ingredients related to such issues as the monitoring of SWAPO bases in
                    Angola, the question of whether there would be some constitutional principles
                    that would guide the first Namibian Assembly once elected, some parameters so
                    that there'd be some chance for a power sharing constitution to emerge, some
                    issues related to the so-called impartiality or partiality of the UN system,
                    because the UN was going to supervise the transition in Namibia once it
                    started.</p>
                <p>So how to assure the South Africans that the UN-led process would be “impartial,”
                    as between the local, internal Namibian parties and SWAPO, which was the armed
                    insurgency or liberation group.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the first phase of the negotiation was to deal with those issues and we
                    did make some headway and we were working what I'd call finer points of
                    diplomatic amelioration or emendation of an existing agreement.</p>
                <p>And it was a way of demonstrating to everybody that this elaborate machinery, the
                    Western Contact Group, the African Frontline States, could work under our
                    leadership, we could actually move from one thing to the next and we could have
                    meetings and we could produce outcomes that everybody had signed onto.</p>
                <p>By the summer of '82 we'd kind of finished with that and we had some significant
                    degree of engagement with very good people in the Frontline States, from
                    Mozambique, Botswana and Tanzania particularly, actually, it was very
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>So that was progress, but it was very detailed material. One of my colleagues
                    called it “diplomatic needlepoint,” very fine grained stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were doing this, did you have somebody back there
                        stitching away? Could you see a pattern emerge, was this going the way you
                        saw it would, or was it just, “Okay, let's go out and try this and try that”
                        and watching it being put together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: We were working two sides of the street, two sets of agendas. The
                    Namibian agenda I've just been talking about was more of a needlepoint variety,
                    it was very, very detailed and legal drafting stuff, stuff that had a lot of UN
                    dimensions to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because it was a UN</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Plan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it also was technically a UN trust territory, wasn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, it was, in the eyes of many, yes, it was supposed to be a UN trust
                    territory. Not in the eyes of South Africa, of course which was in complete
                    control of the place and had been since it was given a mandate to administer it
                    after World War I.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you bring the UN in, you have to</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: And they'd be the ones implementing the settlement, so it had a number
                    of UN dimensions and we had to work hard on that.</p>
                <p>Yes, I think that we had a sense that progress was being made and we had a team
                    of people who were working on those issues in considerable detail with great
                    skill and working with contact group counterparts who were also down in the
                    weeds detailing with this stuff and were good at it.</p>
                <p>And when we found African frontline people who were also good at it and a few
                    South Africans who were good at it we were able to make some progress.</p>
                <p>I will confess to you this progress was hard to describe for a New York Times
                    journalist, because it was “eyes glaze over” kind of detail..</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>But at the same time on a separate track we were working to open up channels with
                    the Angola government and to get them to agree to the principle of Cuban troop
                    withdrawal and we spent probably sixty, seventy per cent of our time trying to
                    do that, trying to get a breakthrough - a workable channel of communication -
                    with the right Angolans, trying to figure out what kind of a formula they could
                    buy onto, some sort of a “Yes, in principle, provided that” or “Yes, if”
                    formulation. It took a long time to get that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Angolan government, was their feeling, as we saw it,
                        that without the Cuban troops they would go down, or did they feel they
                        could take care of the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, they didn't put it this way of course, but the Cuban troops were
                    the safety blanket for the MPLA regime.</p>
                <p>They depended on them very heavily for dealing with UNITA and this is part of the
                    story that in hindsight becomes clearer and clearer, UNITA was becoming more and
                    more capable of challenging the MPLA during this time period.</p>
                <p>So the military pressure was increasing. It wasn't American military pressure. It
                    was UNITA with the benefit of substantial South African-support.</p>
                <p>So the Cubans became more indispensable, up to a certain point, from the
                    standpoint of this very weak regime.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this would be very tricky. From the South African
                        point of view, would they want essentially a neutralized, benign Namibia,
                        it's a stretch of desert and they don't really need it, or were there
                        aspirations for certain parts of the South African government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: There was a significant minority of Afrikaans-speaking Namibians, both
                    white and colored, who voted in local elections and who were members of the
                    National Party, which was the governing party of South Africa at the time and it
                    became sort of a hot issue in the National Party caucus: “Are you going to sell
                    out to those American negotiators who are trying to make peace?”</p>
                <p>It was that kind of thing, more than it was that they had a huge stake. Namibia
                    was obviously heavily subsidized by the South African treasury, it didn't have a
                    strong tax base. There was a mining industry, but not much else and there was an
                    ostrich farming industry, not much else besides that. And a lot of bureaucrats
                    and a lot of railway subsidies and military bases and that kind of thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>However, it was obviously geopolitical space and depth and it was what separated
                    “communism” from South Africa, and Namibia's was a huge buffer. It's bigger than
                    Texas.</p>
                <p>If you lost that, it meant that if SWAPO came into office or if somebody else
                    promoted by the Angolans comes into office, you've got the “communists” right on
                    your border.</p>
                <p>We tried to break constructive engagement down into phases that would develop a
                    kind of inexorable momentum, because we knew that all the other parties would
                    want to talk to us about the Namibia process linked to Resolution 435.</p>
                <p>They would be much more reluctant, much more twitchy, when it came to talking
                    about the Cuban-Angolan track.</p>
                <p>So our theory was that we would try and make this inexorable momentum on phases
                    one and two, which dealt with first the constitutional principles for a Namibian
                    constituent assembly, which would take place during the UN-supervised
                    transition.</p>
                <p>And then secondly to clean up, under phase two, some of the issues that had not
                    been resolved in the previous diplomacy from the Carter Administration,
                    specifically things to do with the composition and size of UNTAG, the UN force,
                    when it would come in and things to do with the role of the UN special
                    representative, who had already been designated at that time as Martti Ahtisaari
                    and the question of UN impartiality, an issue which the South Africans had made
                    a big deal about. They claimed that the UN as an institution was all on one side
                    against them.</p>
                <p>So these were issues we addressed in phase two and primarily in 1981-82. By the
                    time we got to '82 and into '83 we were really spending the overwhelming bulk of
                    our time on the Cuban track, which was phase three, getting the Cuban track to
                    move. Now that we had shown, if you like, our capacity to move the South
                    Africans, this presumably would give us leverage to move the Angolans and
                    therefore the Cuban track.</p>
                <p>That was the theory and that's the way we proceeded. It was that kind of a
                    sequence.</p>
                <p>So now in our story we're up to '83 and we can perhaps leave it there and go to
                    some other African issues for a moment and then come back again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a question I want to ask, at the time was anybody
                        saying, “The Soviet Union's going to collapse within five years or so,”
                        while you were doing this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>CROCKER: No, I don't think anyone was thinking that. What we did see and this
                    begins to address your question, we did see that the Mozambicans were getting
                    told, “Nyet” quite often, when it came to rolling over debt or getting more
                    credits or whatever. So Mozambique's leadership was in the uncomfortable
                    position of having a superpower patron that was a reluctant participant in
                    subsidizing a totally statist, feckless government.</p>
                <p>And so they were getting pushback on that side and then on the South African side
                    the Frelimo government was getting beaten up, because South Africa was building
                    up RENAMO as a sword over their heads and destabilizing the country, large parts
                    of the country.</p>
                <p>So Mozambique was uncomfortable. We watched the Mozambique thing pretty closely
                    and we were interested in why it was that the Russians weren't handing out more
                    support to the Mozambique government.</p>
                <p>Were they making a choice? Were they encouraging the Mozambicans to come over? We
                    were actively wooing the Mozambicans to come over.</p>
                <p>Mozambique, I should say, is a very strategic place. It's got a coastline longer
                    than California's and three of the best deepwater ports in Africa. It's the
                    major place from which the Copper Belt's copper and cobalt is exported.</p>
                <p>This is a serious strategic stake and the Soviets seemed to be saying, “Do we
                    really care that much?” So it opened the door for us and for our European
                    friends to play a more aggressive hand in Mozambique.</p>
                <p>Angola was much more closed. In fact, by the mid-Eighties we had creative
                    Mozambican help to open the doors in Angola. Fascinating!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have relations with Mozambique?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes, we did, although they were strained in the early years of the
                    Eighties and at one stage we didn't have an ambassador anymore and we had a
                    charg� only and they didn't have anybody much here.</p>
                <p>It was a cool period, but eventually we built it back up again and assigned
                    really first rate people.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As an active duty Foreign Service Officer and now retired,
                        this is normal diplomatic practice, when the going gets tough we yank out
                        our ambassador as a sign of disapproval, just when we really should almost
                        add more resources to deal with a problem, we cut and run. This is
                        diplomatic practice, which has always struck me as being wrong headed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I'm not as well briefed as I ought to be on the specifics of this, but
                    there was an intelligence incident of some sort here, which led to a reciprocal
                    expulsion and I think it was in that context that we downgraded relations and
                    then we built them back up again.</p>
                <p>But this was an intelligence screw-up that we found out about and had to deal
                    with the results of and that wasn't the only one that took place, by the way,
                    where somebody's trying to recruit somebody or</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well my understanding is that the Agency, this is well
                        known, was using Africa mainly as a place to recruit Soviet and other
                        diplomats, not so much for finding out what was happening in the country
                        itself.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: That's right. It was Cold War game playing that went on and a lot of it
                    was completely without reference to the local equities.</p>
                <p>But having said that, there were some places where the Agency helped us a lot,
                    the clandestine side of the Agency, in terms of getting us briefed up for
                    meetings at the top level and knowing a hell of a lot about what the host
                    government was going to say to us and what was on its mind.</p>
                <p>We had human resources that were directly pertinent to the local situation that
                    were damned good, in some cases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Africa is not Angola. It's a whole continent out there.
                        What was going on that was of particular interest to the United States in
                        Africa, up to the end of the '83 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, there were at least four or five key themes and dynamics at that
                    time that were challenges for us, or maybe opportunities for us.</p>
                <p>One was that the Soviet Union was having some difficulties affording its empire
                    and did not really have answers for many of its clients' needs and
                    questions.</p>
                <p>And so we saw an opportunity there to do what we called “the weaning of
                    Marxists,” the weaning of them from Moscow and there were a number of candidates
                    for that.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>Some of them were real Marxists, some of them were “Yves Saint Laurent” Marxists
                    or they were phony Marxists or whatever. I'm talking about such governments as
                    Ethiopia; Mozambique; Angola, of course; Congo-Brazzaville would be another
                    case; to some extent, the Ghana of Jerry Rawlings; Benin, back at that time; the
                    government of Cape Verde, another Marxist state that came out of the Portuguese
                    revolution.</p>
                <p>So, one thrust of policy was to make an effort systematically to build bridges to
                    these so-called Marxist regimes and test them.</p>
                <p>That was the policy, to test them to see if they in fact were interested in
                    looking at an alternative and what a Western alternative would consist of and
                    what they would need to do to have a Western option and what we could offer to
                    encourage them to look at a Western option. So it was a reciprocal process. I
                    call it engagement.</p>
                <p>We engaged in that kind of dialogue with a half dozen other states in Africa as
                    I've indicated and there were probably more on that list at the time.</p>
                <p>And then secondly we faced the challenge of what to do about Gaddafi. Gaddafi at
                    a minimum had to be kept in his box. He was nothing but trouble.</p>
                <p>He had a skillful diplomacy of subversion and corruption and buying influence and
                    building mosques in places where there was limited local enthusiasm for them.
                    Lots of brown envelopes were passed.</p>
                <p>And he wanted to take over the OAU, as it then was. He wanted to destabilize
                    longstanding friends of the United States. He probably was active in as many as
                    a dozen neighboring countries in the Sahel region of West Africa, Central
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>Very active in Chad, seeking to bolster his claim to what was called the Aouzou
                    Strip, which is a northern band of territory that touches the Chadian-Libyan
                    border.</p>
                <p>So Gaddafi was active across the board and this represented for us a significant
                    policy challenge and also a thrust of our policy in terms of response.</p>
                <p>That response consisted of bolstering friends, providing significant foreign
                    assistance, both economic and military. And if you look at the pattern of U.S.
                    assistance in the Eighties, it is explained in part by supporting governments
                    that actually worked, where we could find them. Secondly, supporting governments
                    that we saw as moving away from Moscow. Obviously, supporting longstanding
                    friends that faced, as we saw it, threats from Soviet clients or from Libyan
                    clients, or from Libya itself. So that is somewhat the pattern of U.S.
                    assistance.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With Libya, what was motivating Gaddafi, as we saw it at
                        the time? Was it ego, creating an empire, just being a bad boy, or what, as
                        we saw it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: As we saw it and probably still do see it, to some extent, because some
                    things don't ever change.</p>
                <p>Well, first of all, we saw him as having somewhat of a free hand, because a
                    little money goes a long way in sub-Saharan Africa. And here was a guy with a
                    big ego and a big wallet playing in a very small pond, if you like. And for him
                    I think it was irresistible as a way of accumulating people who would be
                    supporters, or people who would be at least somewhat responsive to his
                    influence.</p>
                <p>We did not see him as a Soviet cats paw, but we saw him as falling sometimes into
                    exactly the same game of destabilization. So our game was to try to stabilize
                    fragile places that risked falling into the wrong hands. That was the way we
                    defined our efforts.</p>
                <p>So I think we saw him as somewhat of a Castro-like figure, an African caudillo,
                    or an Arab caudillo, very nationalistic, very ambitious, eager to stand up to
                    the US</p>
                <p>He would have loved to have taken over a whole band of other states, been a
                    Nasser-like figure, if you like.</p>

                        think that the leaders, Marxist or what have you, would be somewhat dubious
                        about getting too close to a guy like Gaddafi.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I'm told by people who dealt with him, they thought he was a little bit nuts and
                    I'm sure this came across to others. This wasn't somebody you wanted to give the
                    family jewels to.</p>
                <p>CROCKER: That's absolutely right and as soon as we made clear our interest in
                    being a helpful partner and also using our eyes and ears to warn people, warn
                    our friends in African countries, what he was up to, using our intelligence,
                    they were quite responsive.</p>
                <p>They saw exactly the point that you're making, that you want to sup with a long
                    spoon when you sup with the devil, so to speak.</p>
                <p>But he often brought a lot of resources with him, so that people were tempted.
                    This was not just an East-West arena. It was Gaddafi trolling for influence with
                    his neighbors.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have a wonderful description from an interview I did
                        with Tony Quainton, who was at that time our ambassador to the Central
                        African Empire, where Gaddafi came and distributed gifts and they all turned
                        Muslim, the whole leadership turned Muslim, until it was cocktail time and
                        then they converted again.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>But what about on the Marxist side? There was sort of the “London School of
                    Economics” Marxists. I put Nyerere and all in there. And then you had other ones
                    who at least were giving lip service to Marxism. How did you deal with them?</p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, you're right that we had to distinguish among these different
                    varieties and there were quite different types.</p>
                <p>For those who came out of a revolutionary tradition of violent change, they were
                    parties that were committed to struggle and they lived by such slogans as “A
                    Luta Continua” and so they had a kind of struggle tradition which was very much
                    like that of Che Guevara, they were true believers. They were struggle
                    politicians.</p>
                <p>Others had received what you might call regime support and money from an early
                    stage and had built fraternal relationships between their governing parties and
                    the governing parties of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. So that would be
                    more the case in a place like Brazzaville or Benin, back in the time I'm talking
                    about.</p>
                <p>And then there's a third category of regimes which were very deeply dependent for
                    their very survival, in terms of military assistance, in terms of intelligence
                    support on Moscow and Moscow's agents in Eastern Europe and Cuba.</p>
                <p>And I'm thinking here of Angola and Ethiopia. Those governments did not have, in
                    my view, real sovereignty. They did not have the capacity at that time to make
                    independent decisions on critical security issues. There was such a heavy input
                    of influence and arm twisting and what have you from the Communist Party of the
                    Soviet Union, the CPSU International Department was actually a party at the
                    table in their cabinets, in some cases and you could sense it.</p>
                <p>So you have these different varieties of Marxists. I like to describe some of
                    them as “Yves Saint Laurent” Marxists because their formal, ideological stance
                    was fashionable. It got them some foreign aid money. It was like being in a
                    singles bar. They could say, “Look what these guys are doing for us. What are
                    you going to do for us?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself, with some of the softer Marxists,
                        getting almost at cross purposes with the German socialists, the
                        Scandinavians, who had their left wing which was somewhat ideological and
                        all. Was this a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>CROCKER: It could occasionally be a thorn, let's put it that way. It took a long
                    while for the Scandinavians to recognize the bankruptcy of Tanzania's ujamaa
                    socialism.</p>
                <p>Julius Nyerere was a wonderful man and a founding father of his country and he
                    built a kind of national unity that held up through the years and he understood
                    about multiethnic coalition building, in a country with many, many ethnicities
                    and languages.</p>
                <p>I give him credit for a lot of things he did. He was also a regional statesman of
                    some considerable talent and vision. He worked hard to keep the superpowers out
                    of Africa by balancing them off and so forth.</p>
                <p>But when it came to domestic economic governance, he was an unmitigated disaster
                    for his country and his people and lost them decades. But it took a long time
                    for the Swedes, particularly, to recognize that.</p>
                <p>And so we would occasionally get visitations from our Swedish friends who'd come
                    to town, I think they had to figure out how to prepare themselves each time they
                    descended into Ronald Reagan's Washington: “How do we get along with the
                    heathen?” would be kind of what they'd ask themselves.</p>
                <p>But they would try to persuade us that we should be more forthcoming towards
                    Tanzania and towards Mozambique. I've got bookshelves of works by Swedish
                    scholars on the FRELIMO experiment in Mozambique and why it should be worthy of
                    support, without conditions, because of what had happened there during
                    Portuguese rule.</p>
                <p>So, we had a little friction, I would say, primarily with the Swedes and then
                    occasionally with the Dutch, over these sort of issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the Swedes, was the feeling that this was a carry
                        over, we had gone through a very difficult time during the Vietnam War with
                        the Swedes. They were being very high principled, at a great distance, in
                        dealing with the problem. In a way their media was having a wonderful time
                        beating us up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Now, Vietnam was over, but did you feel this almost a carry over, sort of this
                    was the thing to do in intellectual society in Sweden?</p>
                <p>CROCKER: I think it was the thing to do in terms of Nordic foreign policy, to
                    some extent. A bit of it was posturing and you saw some of this with the German
                    Social Democrats, as well, distinguishing and differentiating themselves from
                    the United States and looking at the United States as a kind of new empire.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>Of course the Swedes have a long history of being a big power themselves and they
                    conducted themselves a bit more in your face than the other Nordics tended to
                    do.</p>
                <p>Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of respect for Sweden, Swedish diplomacy and
                    their diplomats. When we're working together we can get things done, but we were
                    not working together in the Eighties in East and Southern Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern on your part, that, okay, we're trying
                        to do these things in Africa and we're trying to bring a solution. Another
                        side of that is as I do these oral histories I can't help but come to the
                        conclusion that we are sort of the essential power, the only one that really
                        in a way tries to do things, rightly or wrongly, in many of the world's
                        situations, trying not to be too heavy handed or arouse anti-colonial
                        feelings and all this. Did you find yourself having to kind of watch
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, for sure and of course we're talking about a part of the world,
                    Africa, where the political culture and the media environment does not lend
                    itself to transparency or lend itself, at least it didn't in the Eighties, to
                    any kind of accountability for things that were said or not said.</p>
                <p>So it was easy to plant devil theory and we were operating in an environment
                    where we'd have a press conference, whenever I traveled I'd always try to have
                    some access, in different capitals, with the local media.</p>
                <p>And it would be startling, the kind of questions you'd get and the extraordinary
                    lack of information that was carried in the minds of people working in the media
                    world and the gullibility, I guess you would put it that way, of people who were
                    being fed stuff by their government or by our global adversaries and their
                    various allies and our own western critics.</p>
                <p>So it was an interesting environment to work in. But we didn't try to go it
                    alone. I don't want to create at all that impression. I think we worked very
                    hard with key allies and others to have partners and to have them out in front
                    of us on some things.</p>
                <p>Some obvious cases in point: we probably did as much as any administration since
                    Jack Kennedy to work with the French. The French are not easy to work with, but
                    they're essential to work with in a region where they have substantial influence
                    and we spent a lot of time trying to figure out exactly who's on first, who's on
                    second, who's on third in the complex French African policy apparatus, whether
                    it was in the �lys�e or the Quai or in the intelligence work or the military or
                    the cooperation ministry.</p>
                <p>So there are at least five power centers in Paris. We really worked that hard and
                    it got to the point we were exchanging detailed analyses of the balance of
                    payments in Senegal and how we could work in the World Bank and the IMF to
                    provide joint messages that would support a decent government trying to do the
                    right things in a place like Senegal.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>The French in fact welcomed this in many ways and I think they were somewhat
                    responsive. So that's an example.</p>
                <p>We worked with the French extremely closely in the case of Chad, of course. It
                    was a French-American-Chadian military campaign that defeated Gaddafi's armored
                    corps in the northern Chadian desert. That couldn't have happened if we weren't
                    working very, very closely with our French partners.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting, because if you sort of look at the
                        newspapers and all of almost any period, things are often cast that the
                        French are the burr under the saddle and a problem, yet, I know,
                        particularly around this period, I remember when I was consul general in
                        Naples and would talk to Admiral Crowe, who was CINCSOUTH, based in Naples
                        and he would say that the French were really sort of the best of allies, in
                        naval terms and I get this from others, saying that both militarily and in
                        intelligence the French have been pretty consistently very close us. It's
                        not just they're close to us, we're to them, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Whereas often, maybe it's the Quai d'Orsay or maybe it's the �lys�e, which for
                    political purposes or something is somewhat distant.</p>
                <p>CROCKER: That's right and a lot depends on the relations between ministers and
                    you have quite a few involved. You have a defense minister, a cooperation
                    minister, a foreign affairs minister and then you have the policy apparatus
                    inside the �lys�e. It's not unlike Washington, in that sense.</p>
                <p>So it was a fulltime job. But, yeah, picking up on your point, it was always
                    easier for us to get cooperation either between intelligence services or
                    military to military. But the job of getting the diplomats to actually sit down
                    and talk very frankly about a common plan, that took some doing. But we did our
                    best. It didn't always work.</p>
                <p>The other example, of course, is the British, who are the other major power in
                    Africa, were then and are now, in terms of a cooperating partner.</p>
                <p>If you want to do something jointly and have some impact beyond your own impact
                    in a place like Nairobi or Kampala or Lusaka or Accra, you'd be nuts not to be
                    working very, very closely with the Brits, who are much easier to work with and
                    we had very intimate bilateral exchanges.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>Once, sometimes twice a year we'd sit down and spend three days together going
                    over the accounts country by country by country, military, security,
                    intelligence, development, issues of the opposition, issues of regime stability,
                    how to try and make the trains run again in Southern Africa, what to do to
                    support troubled friends or block troublesome adventurers - that sort of
                    thing.</p>
                <p>So it was a very close partnership and we invested a lot of our time and effort
                    in it, as we did with the Japanese, to some extent, with the Portuguese, I could
                    go on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Horn of Africa? This was still Mengistu and
                        the Derg and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: It sure was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we just see that as a hopeless cause, or what could we
                        do there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: The Horn of Africa was one of the more sensitive and important strategic
                    zones of Africa at that time, in part because Sudan had been a key friend on the
                    CampDavid process, had provided rare support from another Arab country for what
                    the Egyptians had done.</p>
                <p>And so we had a sense this was, if you like, part of Middle East policy, but we
                    felt it very important to bolster Sudan, also to bolster it vis-�-vis
                    Gaddafi.</p>
                <p>So that was part of our situation. We also became aware in '83-'84-'85, of
                    course, of the fact that Gaafar Nimeiry was losing his way and was starting to
                    imbibe more of this Islamist Kool-aid</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the leader of Sudan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Nimeiry was beginning to imbibe, if you like, this religious zeal and
                    raised into question the whole North-South agreement that had been negotiated in
                    the early 70s to end the first phase of the Sudanese civil war.</p>
                <p>And Nimeiry reopened that and started the war again in '83-'84 and caused us a
                    terrific amount of pain. So that was a case of a country, Sudan, which was an
                    important partner that became self-destructive to the point that it didn't offer
                    us much in the way of help.</p>
                <p>What it offered us was a big headache and we had to figure out how to deal with
                    that, what to do when Nimeiry was replaced, I believe, in '85, how to deal with
                    successor governments, recognizing of course that right next door to Sudan was
                    Soviet-backed Ethiopia, which was actively destabilizing Sudan.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>So we looked at Sudan through many different optics: as a troubled friend, as a
                    threatened friend, as a key partner of the Camp David process and as a country
                    that we wanted to keep hopefully in one piece and better health.</p>
                <p>That was part of our Horn of Africa policy. Another part was what to do
                    specifically with Ethiopia, which is the big guy on the block in the Horn of
                    Africa, and a very troubled place as well.</p>
                <p>Mengistu was, throughout his days, pretty much of a thug. He ruled by the gun. My
                    best imagery for understanding Mengistu Haile Mariam was to remember back to the
                    photographs that were put out in Ethiopian media that would show a cabinet
                    meeting which had a long table and showed you all the ministers. At the very end
                    of the table was Mengistu, but his figure would be blown up five times bigger
                    than life.</p>
                <p>It sort of made your eyes pop, to look at this picture of a cabinet and here's
                    this great big guy at the end, who is farthest away and should be smallest, but
                    he's five times bigger.</p>
                <p>So Mengistu, a man who arguably came from the underprivileged communities of
                    Ethiopia and had been treated in a way that made him paranoid, with a chip on
                    his shoulder and treated most of the ethnic groups of the country badly, caused
                    hundreds of thousands of death of his own soldiers and the soldiers of Tigray
                    and Eritrea and basically lived on that civil war, because the civil war assured
                    him of Soviet support.</p>
                <p>As long as there was a civil war, the Soviets would be there, because the Soviet
                    currency for Africa policy was military aid.</p>
                <p>The American currency for Africa policy was our brains, our diplomacy and our
                    foreign assistance, but not that much military aid.</p>
                <p>The Soviets accounted in this time period for between 60 and 75 per cent of the
                    military aid going into Africa. We were behind the French. So that puts it in
                    perspective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Soviets didn't seem to be very good at relations with
                        other countries. It's one thing to hand over a lot of battle tanks and all
                        that, that assures the military has toys and keeps them in power, but it
                        doesn't build up any long term relationship/</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Were we looking at the Soviets as being a sometime thing in Africa?</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>CROCKER: We drank a lot of our Kool-aid and they drank a lot of their Kool-aid.
                    Our view was and we saw it in action, that they were not really very good or
                    very quick or very smooth with Africans. They gave them a lot of support in
                    selective cases for selective purposes.</p>
                <p>They brought a lot of students to Moscow, but the innate racism of the Russian
                    people I think was very evident to Africans from day one. Africans could figure
                    out that in the United States there were whites who were racists and there were
                    whites who were not. They didn't meet too many of the latter type in Russia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I recall when I was in Belgrade, dealing with an exodus of
                        African students, including Ethiopians, from Sofia, who had gone to sort of
                        Lumumba junior college there and they were all claiming they were called
                        “Black monkeys.” It was not a very welcoming society.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I think that's fair to say, but it's also fair to say that some African
                    elites and leaders became very ideologically committed to what they were doing
                    and the ideology was sincere, in the sense that they were battling some
                    adversary, whether it was white minority rule, colonial rule, or whether it was
                    some opponent locally and they found that the Soviet support was steadfast and
                    therefore that the Soviets or the Russians were political allies.</p>
                <p>And to this day, if you look at the people who have emerged at the top of the ANC
                    structure in South Africa, you'll find a number of people who spent years in the
                    Soviet Union and also in other places, but significantly in the Soviet Union and
                    who therefore, when they go to Moscow, they look up old friends. Friends who may
                    have been their handlers, or advisors or</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And true friendship, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: It becomes personal at some stage, no doubt, as it does with us. But I
                    don't think that it was very effective people to people diplomacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything, while you were there, that you could
                        do about the Horn of Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: That's the important question and you put your finger on it. I should
                    mention that we also had another troubled friend in Siad Barre in Somalia, who
                    had come out on top of the wars for control of his country back in the late
                    Seventies, but he also made a mess of things by overdoing it and attacking
                    Ethiopia and then getting his clock cleaned by Soviet-, Cuban-backed
                    Ethiopia.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>So there was a standoff there and Siad Barre would always look at us and say,
                    “What are you doing for me today, compared to all that they're doing for those
                    awful people next door?” So it was that kind of Cold War-linked
                    polarization.</p>
                <p>We found that the Horn was a very, very difficult operating arena. We did the
                    right thing where we could on a humanitarian level. We saved hundreds of
                    thousands, if not millions, of Ethiopian lives during the famines of '84 and
                    '85. We did more for the Ethiopians than their government did.</p>
                <p>Some will argue that we were slow to get started doing that. I think once we
                    realized what we were dealing with we addressed that challenge, the challenge of
                    the famine. It was a hideous situation, where the government was really starving
                    its own people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this on purpose, or just ineptitude?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: In some cases they wanted to use the famine to force people to move from
                    one part of the country to another, into collectivized villages, that sort of
                    thing. So it was a technique of rural control, as they saw it.</p>
                <p>So we could respond on a humanitarian level, as we did. Secondly, we responded
                    quite skillfully to bring out of Ethiopia a huge number of Ethiopia's Jewish
                    population, via Sudan into Israel, the Falashas.</p>
                <p>So that was a success, but that's against the backdrop where, quite frankly, I
                    think we were unsuccessful in moving Ethiopia.</p>
                <p>Ethiopia didn't get moved until the Tigrayans of the TPLF got their act together
                    (with some non-lethal cross-border support from Sudan) as the Soviet Union was
                    collapsing in 1990-91.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we considering, I don't want to get into intelligence
                        activities, but on the State Department side were we considering support to
                        the Eritreans or the Tigrayans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: We were considering it and we decided not to do it in clandestine,
                    military terms. What we did do was crossborder feeding programs, run out of OFDA
                    in AID, which the Ethiopian government and its friends saw as direct
                    intervention in their internal affairs, because we were helping people go across
                    borders and we were helping food to move across borders and we were feeding an
                    army, in effect. We were feeding insurgencies, in effect.</p>
                <p>But we were feeding them with foodstuffs and with tents. We were not doing what
                    you would call a covert military program. Nothing covert about it, except that
                    we didn't go into detail in public testimony in order to protect our Sudanese
                    channel.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a thought process behind not doing a covert
                        action? Again, I'm treading on difficult ground, but the point being there
                        has to be an intellectual process, do we do this, or don't we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes, there does and if he had had a completely free hand in running the
                    American government, as he sometimes dreamed, I think Bill Casey at CIA might
                    very well have wanted to have a few more pins on the global map, a few more
                    anti-Soviet insurgencies to run.</p>
                <p>Bill Casey wanted to basically have a war in every region that he was running. He
                    had one in Afghanistan, he had one in Nicaragua. He wanted ardently to have one
                    in Angola and eventually there was one in Angola which involved clandestine
                    support for UNITA.</p>
                <p>He and his people pushed very hard to get such an approach to Mozambique and we
                    fought very hard to prevent it, and we succeeded in preventing it.</p>
                <p>This never became such a big issue in the case of the Horn of Africa and there
                    were two reasons. One was that there was a terrific humanitarian need and we
                    could do a lot by a feeding program both inside Ethiopia and the cross-border
                    program, so we did and it helped.</p>
                <p>The second thing is that the TPLF and the EPLF were more Marxist than Marx. They
                    were Trotskyite. They were pretty far over, not ideal CIA bedmates.</p>
                <p>Today, of course, it's a little different, but it's a little bit hard for the
                    Heritage Foundation to hold up Meles Zenawi or Isaias Afewerki as paragons of
                    freedom fighters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the Heritage Foundation, which at the
                        time and maybe even today represents the fairly far right of the American
                        political spectrum.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I do have, however, cartoons from the Washington Times that I've framed
                    that portray me holding would-be captive African slaves in bondage because we
                    wouldn't engage in supporting them in their struggle for freedom and of course
                    the Africans were the peoples of Mozambique, the peoples of Ethiopia and so
                    forth.</p>
                <p>And we were “holding them in bondage” because we didn't get on “their side,” The
                    side of the “freedom fighters”. Anyway, it was interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we get now to, what, about '85 and phase 3?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, phase 3 starts really in late '82 and '83, but phase 3 is trying
                    to mobilize the Cuban withdrawal process in Angola.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we see anything for the Cubans in getting the hell
                        out? Were they feeling they were stuck in a swamp?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I think our view was that the Cubans would eventually realize that they
                    were in a quagmire and we witnessed year after year in central and southern
                    Angola dry season offensives by the government of Angola with active Cuban
                    support and Soviet support.</p>
                <p>In '83 we saw a big dustup. We saw a big dustup in '81. It was like every other
                    year. I guess it took them a year to restock. '85, there were big confrontations
                    and in '87. So it was like every odd year.</p>
                <p>And the price tag for Cubans was hard for us to assess. Not easy to know how many
                    casualties they were taking, not easy to know how much of the Cubans' costs was
                    being subsidized by the Angolans and by the Russians.</p>
                <p>By the time we did engage with the Cubans, which didn't come 'til the end of the
                    whole process, we knew that the shoe was pinching badly, because Cubans would
                    confide in us that their boys were coming home with diseases which even the
                    Cuban medical service could not deal with and the Cuban medical service is very
                    advanced. And they were really not happy with what was being brought back home
                    to the island from their experience in Angola.</p>
                <p>They probably also realized that this was not going to be ever a great victory,
                    so they began to think at some stage, but we don't know exactly when to this
                    day, that peace with honor might be worth looking at.</p>
                <p>We were constrained in the Bureau of African Affairs, at least I was constrained,
                    from any thoughts about directly engaging the Cubans, so we did not have that
                    possibility in '83-'84-'85, back at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain a bit why you were constrained? Put
                        somebody in the picture who is looking at this.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, we had no relations with Castro and talking to him would be an
                    awfully big deal and it would not be approved or supported by probably anybody
                    in our political process, in the absence of some new factor or new ingredient
                    that would enable you so to fend off the predictable questions: “Well, why would
                    you do that? Aren't you giving him a gift? Aren't you rewarding them by talking
                    to them? Aren't you dignifying their adventure by talking to them, when we're
                    trying to get them out of their adventure?”</p>
                <p>The language we used and the language I still use to this day is that the Cubans
                    were engaged in an ideological adventure in Africa of global socialist
                    solidarity, in part because they were blocked in their own hemisphere, so they
                    were displaced into Africa.</p>
                <p>But let's not forget also that Cuba is a multiracial society and they're very
                    proud of it and they have therefore a natural affinity and are good at relating
                    to their African brothers and sisters. And many Angolans had training in Cuba.
                    So that was a relationship that was in some ways more of equals than with the
                    Russians.</p>
                <p>In any event, I would not have gotten approval for talking directly with the
                    Cubans, had I proposed it. The only times we talked to the Cubans in the first
                    half of the 1980's was over issues to do with immigration and with their role in
                    the conflict in Nicaragua.</p>
                <p>We did send Vernon Walters to Cuba at several stages to warn them to “cut it out”
                    in Nicaragua, but we never did that about Angola and I think, perhaps,
                    hindsight's always perfect, I remember talking to Al Haig about this in '81. He
                    said, “We'll talk to the Russians about getting the Cubans under control.”</p>
                <p>This kind of assumes that the Russians have the Cubans under control. I've never
                    been totally persuaded of that myself. It takes two to tango, or maybe more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you feeling, as you did this, looking over your
                        shoulder, the Miami Cuban political machine, was this a factor in dealing
                        with the Cubans, or was this a minor problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, since we weren't dealing with the Cubans on African policy, it
                    wasn't a factor. But it became a factor when we started dealing with the
                    Cubans.</p>
                <p>And it also became a factor when the Miami Cubans got mobilized on the UNITA
                    issue in '85 and '86, which we have to talk about, because the political
                    parameters changed around that time, both vis-�-vis South Africa and Angola.</p>
                <p>And at that point the Miami Cubans joined the fray as kind of right wing allies
                    and fellow travelers of UNITA. So we did hear their voice.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>But just to finish the point on the Cubans, we couldn't negotiate with them. We
                    knew they were in the room, virtually, along with the Russians, every time we
                    talked to the Angolans. We were confident that our meetings in Angola were being
                    taped.</p>
                <p>Our hotel rooms were being taped. We went to Angola frequently and we'd wake up
                    the next morning and realize that we probably shouldn't have even had that one
                    little conversation, because it would be played back to us by show-offs who'd
                    say, “Oh, I hear you're turning forty next week” or something, just to prove
                    that they'd really done their homework.</p>
                <p>So we often had the sense that the people we were talking to were not the people
                    that we had to talk to and that was very frustrating.</p>
                <p>I would say by the latter part of 1983 the contact group and the Namibian issues
                    were pretty much sewed up.</p>
                <p>Our contact group allies and, for that matter, our frontline state partners did
                    not want to be formally part of our diplomacy over Cuban troop withdrawal from
                    Angola.</p>
                <p>So we were dealing much more solo from that point on, with a lot of help from
                    Great Britain. The British supported our diplomatic efforts with the
                    Angolans.</p>
                <p>But we used every channel and technique we could find: friends we developed in
                    Mozambique, friends we developed in Europe, in France and all sorts of places,
                    to reach into the MPLA, that's the Angolan government, to reach into the MPLA
                    structure, to disassemble it, to understand it, to do the Kremlinology on the
                    MPLA that was necessary to figure out who to talk to.</p>
                <p>And by the middle of '83 and well into '84 we were talking, finally, to some of
                    the right people and we were beginning to get to the point that one could
                    envisage them giving us a Cuban troop withdrawal proposal of some sort.</p>
                <p>They would accept the need to talk about it and they would agree in principle
                    that there would have to be one. What we were looking for was to get such a
                    proposal from them. We were trying to get the Angolans to make a bid, to give us
                    their opening bid, and we tried not to use that term, because that implied that
                    there would have to be a lot of other bids. But it was a long, arduous process,
                    of coaching, coaxing and getting to know each other, with the right people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about how one gets to know the right
                        people. If anybody reading goes back, we spent years developing this
                        Kremlinological technique: who stood where on Lenin's Tomb and all
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>But, okay, you've got this new African country and I take it the structure was
                    opaque, who was running what. It hadn't developed into real solid ministries and
                    rank order and all that.</p>
                <p>CROCKER: You got it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How'd you work on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: You work on it by talking to partners who do have diplomatic
                    representation in Luanda. Secondly, you work on it through intelligence sources,
                    if you have them and they weren't very good, frankly, on the MPLA, because we
                    didn't have a station there and it was not so easy to penetrate.</p>
                <p>The Portuguese were very helpful, but the Portuguese also come with a lot of
                    baggage and some of the MPLA, in fact, were white Portuguese communists. So one
                    had be to very aware of the baggage of our Portuguese friends as we tried to
                    analyze the MPLA.</p>
                <p>There was a handful of academics, two, three, at the outside, in this country who
                    really, really knew Angola well and we tried to stay close to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they able to visit Angola?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yeah, they could visit and they had friends and they had connections and
                    they could shed light on some aspects of the Angolan regime's puzzles.</p>
                <p>So eventually we figured out that there were probably four or five types of
                    Angolan officials and that we had to maneuver through them and to get to the
                    right ones.</p>
                <p>There were the totally committed ideologues in the foreign ministry, who were
                    hopeless, absolutely hopeless. They were great at drafting UN resolutions
                    condemning linkage and the evils of constructive engagement. They were hopeless
                    interlocutors, who saw it as their job to prevent us from getting through to any
                    of their fellow countrymen.</p>
                <p>There were some interesting generals, senior generals and once we got them at the
                    table we began to get a sense that perhaps they were an autonomous, distinct
                    voice with a point of view of their own.</p>
                <p>There was a key guy who was the minister of interior, Kito Rodriques by name,
                    whom we cultivated as we believed him to be very close to the president.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>There was the president himself, who was a young man when we started this
                    process, he's my age today! He's been in office since 1979 without a break, Jose
                    Eduardo dos Santos, a Soviet-trained petroleum engineer who became president of
                    a country when his predecessor suddenly got ill and died on a Soviet operating
                    table. People have often speculated about that, but that's another story.</p>
                <p>Anyway, dos Santos was a young, technocratic guy who wasn't really fully in
                    charge and not really a free agent. But gradually, over the Eighties, he became
                    more of “the decider,” he got more into the saddle.</p>
                <p>There were young soldiers, there were older soldiers and their were party
                    ideologues who were keepers of the communist flame. There were a variety of
                    people to deal with.</p>
                <p>We had to penetrate that and figure out how do we get an authoritative Angolan
                    proposal as to the timing under which they could see Cubans leaving their
                    country as it was linked to a withdrawal schedule for South Africans from
                    Namibia. That was the goal.</p>
                <p>By the end of '84 we had accomplished two major things in this effort. One, we
                    had negotiated a disengagement agreement that didn't last very long, but while
                    it lasted it showed what could be done between South African forces and Angolan
                    and Cuban forces inside Angola.</p>
                <p>We negotiated a stand down and a disengagement agreement and set up a joint
                    military commission between them. It gave them a taste of what this kind of
                    diplomacy could look like when the time was right, but they were never serious
                    about fully implementing it. They used it as a breather, rather than using it to
                    create momentum for the ultimate peace. I learned an important lesson from that
                    process and have often reflected on the futility of partial or interim
                    ceasefires that are not related organically to the broader political issues of a
                    settlement.</p>
                <p>But at the time it seemed to us like a significant accomplishment and I think it
                    was, because it introduced them to each other. You had South African defense
                    ministers sitting down with Angolan defense ministers and talking turkey. So
                    that was important and setting up real time military-to-military radio links for
                    a while in southern Angola, which was a real breakthrough.</p>
                <p>Secondly, on the diplomatic track, we got a commitment, a public commitment from
                    the Angolan leadership, signed by the president, to something which was called
                    in Portuguese a plataforma, which I think we would call a declaration of
                    principle, which basically said the Cubans will leave, in the context of a peace
                    settlement in Namibia and the Cubans will leave by the sovereign decision of the
                    government of Angola and that there will be an appropriate, I think the term
                    they used was calendario, which we would call a withdrawal schedule.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>So the magic words were uttered by this public, unilateral declaration coming out
                    of Luanda. It was not something we could begin to sell to the South Africans (or
                    accept ourselves). But the point was, if I can put it this way, it may sound a
                    little crude, they had lost their virginity. They had begun to deal. They had
                    begun to see the point of using the words we were wanting them to use, in order
                    to keep open the idea of a package deal. And that's what we were driving for, a
                    package deal of reciprocal binding commitments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any reactions from the Cubans themselves?
                        Here we are talking about their withdrawal, we're going through this right
                        now in Iraq with our troops. Were we getting much from the Cubans in this
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: No, not directly. They did their game at the UN. And they did, in fact,
                    at the same time that dos Santos issued his plataforma, there was in New York an
                    effort to condemn linkage. We assumed the Angolans and Cubans were working hand
                    in glove on both fronts.</p>
                <p>So here you have these two sets of if you like alien theologies rubbing up
                    against each other. Our theology was linkage and parallelism and we'll make a
                    package deal out of it. Their theology was there's no linkage, down with
                    linkage, we're not going to do linkage.</p>
                <p>But it was confusing to people. On the one hand there's dos Santos saying “Our
                    plataforma admits the principle of a calendario in the right context” and then
                    we have the Cubans and Soviets working for a resolution in New York condemning
                    linkage, which passed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would they condemn linkage?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Because it was the core of an American plan and this was the Cold War;
                    never mind that they were in fact at the beginning stages of negotiating on a
                    linkage-based settlement! Perhaps this was the way the covered their own
                    tracks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In any negotiation there's linkage, unless it's a
                        Carthaginian peace or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: The Soviet game at this stage was to delegitimize every thing that we
                    were doing by means of ideological warfare and verbal battling over terminology.
                    The fact that we had an initiative in Southern Africa meant that they were
                    determined to kill it.</p>
                <p>It wasn't on the merits, is what I'm saying. It had nothing to do with the
                    merits. We met with the Soviets several times a year in '82-'83-'84 and we had
                    rather sterile exchanges, where they'd read their talking points to us and we'd
                    read ours back to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, was Gorbachev coming into power at this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Not yet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not yet. So we're still talking about basically</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Andropov.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The dying breed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: One dying Soviet leader after another, yeah. So it was not a period of
                    much creativity on the Soviet side.</p>
                <p>And when Gorbachev came into office, which was in '85, the first thing he turned
                    his attention to was not Angola. So it took a while for any glimmers to come
                    through.</p>
                <p>Their game was the diplomacy of polarization at the UN and then, on the ground,
                    military assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were working with this and trying to find the right
                        people to talk to in the MPLA, were you avoiding the foreign minister and
                        his cohorts or something, did you feel that they were hopeless?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yeah, we just went around them with the active cooperation of Angolans
                    who outranked them politically and everybody knew it. There was a deputy foreign
                    minister, or vice foreign minister, who would join talks that were led by the
                    interior minister and often by a senior general as well. And these talks would
                    take place sometimes in Luanda, sometimes in Cape Verde, sometimes in
                    Mozambique, sometimes in Europe.</p>
                <p>This fellow I mentioned, Kito Rodrigues, came to Washington I believe in early to
                    mid-'84 and was received by George Bush and received by Bud Macfarlane and
                    various people who were major players in our political establishment.</p>
                <p>So it was part of a process of building links. But we just sidelined the
                    unhelpful elements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, was Mozambique a player in this process?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>CROCKER: Very directly, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, Mozambique and Angola of course are brother lusophone countries.
                    They came out of the same colonial experience. They came out of the same
                    revolutionary experience. They knew each other very well.</p>
                <p>There were people in the Mozambican structure that we were working with. I
                    mentioned earlier that we were 'weaning' Marxists. We were trying to create a
                    roadmap with Mozambique that would lead to a much stronger direct relationship
                    between Mozambique and Washington.</p>
                <p>So we developed allies there and they helped us develop allies in Angola. That
                    was the sequence.</p>
                <p>My senior deputy, Frank Wisner, at the time spent half his life running that
                    process. We ran it together, but he was in the lead with the Mozambicans in many
                    cases and spent many, many man-hours working with Samora Machel and Jacinto
                    Veloso and various other Mozambican officials, who eventually led us to Kito
                    Rodrigues and other allies in the Angolan structure.</p>
                <p>So Mozambique was, in a sense, if I may use the terminology of conflict
                    resolution here for a minute, Mozambique was an 'insider partial' in this
                    diplomacy. It was an insider in the sense that it was on Angola's side, it was a
                    brother to the Angolans, but it was advising us, the big superpower, the Western
                    capitalist superpower, on how to basically do our homework and how to play our
                    cards.</p>
                <p>And sometimes the Angolans would invite the Mozambicans to join meetings with us,
                    so that they'd have someone else at the table. It was quite extraordinary how
                    that worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really a fascinating period of diplomacy, because this is
                        where worked.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, diplomacy, it worked in terms of building relationships, in terms
                    of building a sense, if you like, of trust. I'm not sure if trust is even the
                    right word. It's familiarity and it's a sense and that you'll do what you say
                    you'll do and that you'll be there tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. It is a
                    mix of respect for competence, acquaintance, and predictability.</p>
                <p>In some of these cultures it's an investment of time, it's an investment of
                    building relationships, it's also an investment of just plain listening and
                    coming to grips with the world and the history that they live in, rather than
                    expecting that they will just come to grips with the one you live in. It's gotta
                    be both.</p>

                        the nationals did not feel that our officers cared for them: “They don't ask

                <p>Americans don't do that, building up that almost personal regard and
                    interest.</p>
                <p>CROCKER: You've absolutely got to do it and it may even lead to a kind of
                    collusion, if you like, at a certain point. But what you're trying to do is to
                    get people to the point where they can tell you a little bit of the truth and as
                    they do you can tell them a little bit of the truth about what it's going to
                    take to get to the bottom line.</p>
                <p>And events like this, the negotiation of the Lusaka Accord of February '84</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is in the book High Noon in Southern Africa by
                        Chester A. Crocker.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: And there's a picture here of the South African and Angolan military and
                    diplomatic chiefs, with the American mediators in the background, just posing
                    for a photograph as they finished three days of intensive talks and so on. That
                    kind of relationship building is what made things move.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have been concerned about that other great power
                        that we haven't talked about, the far right, or whatever it is, in the
                        United States. It's you and your team working on this and the whole thing
                        could be screwed up by posturing on the part of the right wing in the
                        American political process by stopping you from doing something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I like to use boating analogies and fishing analogies and what happened
                    to us by the end of '84 was that instead of being at the oars in a rowboat,
                    rowing across a lake, we were suddenly like a sailboat with no wind and at the
                    same time in the distance we could see a waterfall and we were heading over that
                    waterfall.</p>
                <p>It got really rough. It got rough simultaneously for two reasons. It wasn't just
                    the right. We and our diplomatic effort got a one-two punch.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>It was a combination of the left going after Ronald Reagan after his great
                    victory in the fall of 1984, going after him on South Africa and mobilizing a
                    nationwide campaign to stop constructive engagement and impose sanctions on
                    South Africa on the one hand and the retaliation, if you like, from the right,
                    saying, “Well, that diplomacy is putting much too much pressure on our friends
                    in South Africa, anyway and the real problem is the Soviets and the Cubans and
                    the communists in Angola and we need to support the freedom fighters of UNITA
                    and not worry about a negotiated settlement. Let's just go for victory. That's
                    what we're doing in Afghanistan. That's what we're doing in Nicaragua. It's what
                    we should do in Africa.”</p>
                <p>So, to finish the analogy, we went over the waterfall, we were in fast moving
                    water and we had to figure out how to survive, how to go with the flow.</p>
                <p>We faced very major attacks on our policy of regional negotiations, both because
                    of the upheaval in South Africa and the American reaction to it and American
                    reaction, as I've said, to Reagan's victory and to the increasingly negative
                    imagery coming out of the township violence in South Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about election victory.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: His election victory, yeah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of '84, which he won big.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yeah, I need to clarify that a little bit more. It was right after the
                    election victory, it was on Thanksgiving Day of 1984 that the anti-apartheid
                    protests started at the South African embassy here.</p>
                <p>So this was immediately post-election, but it was triggered by the unrest in the
                    South African townships, the internal African ferment and disorder and
                    determination to take over the townships from the white security forces, all of
                    that being shown on American TV.</p>
                <p>That created a dynamic of direct frontal attack on the administration inside this
                    country over South Africa policy, at the same time that the right, as you're
                    suggesting, was mobilizing to attack the State Department particularly for its
                    diplomacy of constructive engagement vis-�-vis Angola and Mozambique and the
                    rest of them.</p>
                <p>So we didn't have any wind behind us. We had gales in front of us, if you like.
                    There are all kinds of nautical terms that come to mind, like battening down the
                    hatches and shipping the oars and figuring out how to deal with fast moving
                    waters. We lost our own momentum and were for a period a sitting duck for
                    domestic ideologues and activists who went to work on Congress.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within sort of the government complex, in the State
                        Department, did you find that the congressional relations was helpful, or
                        was this pretty much something you had to do yourself, you and your own
                        people, to meet the questioning from right, left and center on what you were
                        up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: We had some counsel and some help and some company from the
                    congressional relations bureau, but they could not begin to master or carry the
                    argument by themselves.</p>
                <p>Our policy was a very sophisticated policy. It required an understanding of a
                    very nuanced diplomatic background. One had to understand why in fact in this
                    part of the world we had to carry water on both shoulders.</p>
                <p>We were not on one side or the other. We were on the side of a regional peace
                    process. And that's always a tricky message to carry, even if you're a State
                    Department official in the H Bureau going up to talk to people on the Hill.</p>
                <p>So I would say that in terms of the domestic public diplomacy the overwhelming
                    public affairs burden was on us to articulate constructive engagement as it
                    related to South Africa and change inside South Africa.</p>
                <p>That took a great deal of our time and we had to develop a particular task force
                    within the African Bureau to get out the word on why we were working with such
                    focus on the regional diplomacy at a time of apparent instability and possible
                    change in South Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you concerned that constructive engagement, today,
                        even, with some people, I get sort of negative, others very positive.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Were you concerned that, all right, you had a term which had never been used
                    before, so far as I know, it's a very specific term for a specific process at a
                    specific time, that maybe it's not a good idea to have a term, because all of a
                    sudden this is something that rallies opposing forces, or not?</p>
                <p>CROCKER: There's no question that you're right about that. I've thought about it
                    a lot, I've written about it and I've said the only thing wrong with the policy
                    was it had a name! But we do constructive engagement in other parts of the world
                    and we've been doing it both before and since this African process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this served as a rallying cry for various groups.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>CROCKER: It became a bumper sticker, and the problem with it was not only that it
                    became itself a lightning rod, but that different people gave it different
                    definitions.</p>
                <p>And I would wake up in the morning and I would get really pissed off because
                    somebody else had defined my policy, given it a meaning which I never
                    intended.</p>
                <p>“Your policy of constructive engagement with the white racist government of South
                    Africa.” That wasn't the policy! It was never the policy!</p>
                <p>The policy was one of engagement with the region, moving with all those
                    governments and parties who wanted to work towards peaceful alternatives to
                    militarized conflict. But that's harder to put on a bumper sticker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the head of CIA, William Casey, playing dog
                        in the manger or screwing things up or was he not a real problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Oh, he was a real problem. He was a real problem for everyone who had to
                    work with him in every region where he was engaged. He saw himself as an
                    alternative secretary of state.</p>
                <p>And so there were things that he did and things that he encouraged that often
                    poisoned the well for us and gave false signals to some of our negotiating
                    partners.</p>
                <p>I think the South Africans were always confused as to whether or not he really
                    had the ear of Ronald Reagan, or whether George Shultz did. And that obviously
                    influenced what I could do.</p>
                <p>Casey pushed hard to get the Clark Amendment repealed in July of 1985, but then
                    so did we, because we all agreed. The Clark Amendment was an amendment passed at
                    the initiative of former Senator Dick Clark which prohibited direct American
                    assistance and involvement in Angola after the Angolan civil war. It was passed
                    in the mid-1970s, and what it did was to make it impossible for the CIA or for
                    any U.S. agency to provide assistance to any Angolan party.</p>
                <p>We tried, actually, in '81 to get the Clark Amendment repealed, because it would
                    be a Reaganite signal that, to use the phrase, “America is back,” we don't have
                    both hands tied behind our backs, we're capable of competing with our global
                    adversary, that kind of thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>We failed in '81. We succeeded in '85. But of course Casey saw that as the
                    opening of the door for him to take over our Angolan relationship and so we had
                    a tussle about that, and I remember Casey coming down from Shultz's office to my
                    office to ask if he could have a word with me, this is the CIA director, cabinet
                    rank and he didn't have an appointment but I didn't know he was coming.</p>
                <p>Anyway, he sits down on my couch and says to me, “Chet, what about Stingers?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about missiles that were quite effective in
                        Afghanistan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: He didn't beat around the bush. Anyway, so we had what I'd call a long,
                    drawn out arm wrestling match, once the Clark Amendment was repealed and to get
                    the chronology right, July of '85, what kind of a new Angolan policy do we have
                    and is it really new, or is it just reinforced and what do we tell UNITA and
                    what do we tell the MPLA with whom we are trying to negotiate Cuban troop
                    withdrawal?</p>
                <p>I'd been meeting with UNITA all along in the process, to keep them briefed, try
                    to keep them with us, try to keep them sweet, inform them and get input from
                    them. But what the Agency folks wanted to do was to jump into bed with these
                    Maoist freedom fighters under the mistaken assumption that this would constitute
                    a 'policy toward Angola'.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There wasn't really an American military factor in there,
                        a disagreement between Weinberger and Shultz, who didn't get along at all,
                        but I would assume that wasn't much of a problem for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: The Agency was a bigger problem, because they had an alternative
                    diplomatic service and an operational arm, and after the Clark Amendment repeal
                    they had tangible resources and they could say one thing to us and say something
                    else to UNITA or to the South African Defense Forces or anybody they wanted.</p>
                <p>They could say one thing to Shultz and then say the opposite to the French DGSE
                    or the British MI6. And so this required me to develop and I did by the
                    mid-Eighties, my own intelligence service and my own intelligence service was
                    staffed by people who were totally part of my team and were supportive of my
                    process and whom I saw six times a day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is within</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Within the African Bureau. I just had to do that. I had no other
                    option.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>A lot of it was just good diplomats but supplemented by what you might call
                    lateral liaisons that were not necessarily approved by anybody.</p>
                <p>We just had to do it, because we knew that there was an alternative game being
                    played and we had to bring it under control.</p>
                <p>There were four areas of policy that I want to touch on we focused on during the
                    Eighties, in addition to Southern Africa.</p>
                <p>The first had to do with the structural adjustment and the economic agenda that
                    African countries were going through because of the high debt levels, because of
                    the low commodity prices and so forth.</p>
                <p>More and more countries basically were in arrears on their sovereign debt and the
                    question was do we keep on throwing money at countries that are further and
                    further in arrears and do we keep doing negotiated reschedulings of debt in the
                    Paris Club, London Club?</p>
                <p>Do we keep coming up with IMF and World Bank gap-filling exercises to try and
                    keep countries afloat, when nothing was changing that would give you the
                    slightest confidence that they wouldn't be underwater next year?</p>
                <p>So we had to deal with that problem and one of the issues that we faced in the
                    State Department, as you can appreciate, was since we don't control the IMF or
                    the World Bank, we don't have those votes in the State Department, nor does the
                    African Bureau of State necessarily control what USAID does, it was an very
                    intricate set of bureaucratic and political issues for us.</p>
                <p>And we did have at that point 47 countries to deal with, most of which were
                    underwater, in terms of debt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And no real hope, was there, at that time, anyway?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, the only real hope was structural adjustment, which developed over
                    the time since the Eighties a mixed reputation.</p>
                <p>What we were basically saying was unless the liberalization of these economies
                    takes place and there's freedom of capital flows and there is more interregional
                    trade, most African countries have very high trade barriers between each other
                    back then and still do, unless you in a sense open up your economies there's not
                    a whole lot of hope. And even if you do open them up there may not be much
                    hope.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>So it was a message of tough love. It was also a message of conditionality, in
                    which we said to African partners we can put more on the table if you do more
                    things, in terms of policy reform.</p>
                <p>So it was a difficult and protracted dialogue. I think if you look back on it
                    from today people would say there was no choice but structural adjustment.</p>
                <p>But it wasn't done in as politically savvy a way as it might have been, with the
                    net result that there was pushback, governments felt insecure about structural
                    adjustment, there was a nationalistic reflex.</p>
                <p>In some cases the Bank and the Fund were insensitive to the political
                    requirements of making those reforms and so governments felt very weak and
                    fragile in facing up to the necessary.</p>
                <p>But if you asked anybody who had ever read a basic text in economics whether
                    there was any alternative but structural adjustment, they would have probably
                    said, “Well, not really.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could explain, in the African context,
                        what you meant by structural adjustment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, essentially, policy reforms in the way of liberalization, getting
                    government out of the business of running the entire economy, opening up the
                    banking system so that there could be international involvement in the banking
                    sector , reforming the banks so that there was some sense that local investors
                    could participate and get credit.</p>
                <p>If you were an African business man or woman in the Eighties or Nineties, you
                    couldn't get credit from your banks. The only people who got much credit were
                    the government and the parastatals. So in effect you're reducing the parastatal
                    sector, providing openings for commercial enterprise and opening up trade flows
                    between African countries and between them and the rest of the world, so that
                    Africa could participate in the world economy.</p>
                <p>The basic point I'm making is that I'd say the African Bureau probably spent
                    thirty, forty per cent of its time in these policy dialogues with African
                    friends and partners, because they were difficult dialogues.</p>
                <p>Sometimes they were less than successful. Other times they worked. But we were
                    dealing with a mixed bag of friends, some of whom thought and said to us, “Look,
                    you're the other superpower. If we're going to work with you and not the
                    Russians, you've gotta help us. Where's your checkbook?”</p>
                <p>And our answer to that was, “Well, you're right at one level, but we can't keep
                    throwing American taxpayers' dollars down a rat hole.” So there was a
                    conditionality to things.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were the Soviets doing anything? Were they basically
                        giving an alternative or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: To their select few, they would give considerable alternatives, in the
                    form of unconditional military loans and sometimes civilian loans, but just to
                    their select few. So they didn't have a long list.</p>
                <p>We would up having to have these dialogues with thirty or more countries. Their
                    long list consisted of a bunch of failed Soviet clients, or failing Soviet
                    clients, like Congo-Brazzaville, Benin, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Angola,
                    Ethiopia, not a long list. They were going down, basically, at that point.</p>
                <p>And the Soviets, of course, the cost of empire for them was going up. They were
                    in the position of propping up failing governments, not only in Africa but in
                    Central America and Afghanistan and so forth.</p>
                <p>So from their perspective they were pulling back a little bit in the
                    mid-Eighties. And once Gorbachev came in, which was April or May of '85, once
                    Gorbachev came in you saw a different Soviet message.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Still at this point a good number of these countries were
                        one party, president for life, type governments. This restructuring must
                        have threatened them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, yes, because these kinds of regimes maintained themselves by
                    steering money to their patronage networks, which may have been, in some cases a
                    thousand people, in other cases a couple of hundred people and also steering
                    resources to the urban elites who could threaten the regime.</p>
                <p>Basically these are urban-based regimes. You had the military, the police, you
                    had the students, you had the trade unions, nearly always in the capital city.
                    And so what they did was to screw the farmers, give nothing to the farmers and
                    give whatever they had to their own power base, which was in the cities.</p>
                <p>I'm generalizing here, of course, about a whole lot of different countries. But
                    that was the basic picture.</p>
                <p>All I'm getting at is that our entire diplomacy was impacted by this difficult
                    burden, their burden and our burden, of how do we get along together as
                    cooperating partners. It was complicated.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As assistant secretary, how do you deal with this, these
                        fifty-off countries or so? You have this massive problem with</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Arrearages and financing gaps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You obviously had to delegate this, but did you devote
                        much time or did you give it to somebody else to figure out the nuances of
                        dealing with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: It's a good question. If affected all of us in the bureau and affected
                    all of our missions overseas. I had four deputies, one of whom spent full time
                    on this and did nothing else. Others spent part of their time. And on the big
                    accounts, the big country relationships, or the major ones, sensitive ones, I
                    would get involved.</p>
                <p>And quite often getting involved means taking an issue upstairs to the under
                    secretary or the secretary of state and saying, “I need your help with Treasury”
                    or “I need your helpwith AID,” “We've gotta do better with OMB in terms of the
                    aid program for the coming fiscal year,” that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>So that's one thing we were doing apart from southern Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In sort of the rest of Africa were there any wars or
                        regimes causing particular trouble at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: It's always your good friends that cause you the most trouble, isn't it?
                    We spent a great deal of time trying to make something out of the government of
                    Liberia, which was then headed by Master Sergeant Samuel Doe.</p>
                <p>I really wouldn't know where to start in estimating the amount of time that was
                    invested in trying to work with him, by my deputies, by myself, by Peter
                    McPherson, the AID Administrator at that time, who spent days trying to work
                    with Doe and a few of his colleagues to get them to understand what policy
                    reform meant and how it could be good for them.</p>
                <p>So, Liberia, yeah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On Liberia, was it just Doe really came from nowhere, very
                        little education. Was this the problem, or was it a mental attitude?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>CROCKER: It was a mixture of almost no formal education, a need to provide some
                    goodies for his boys, fear of what would happen if he didn't and an inability to
                    understand what we were talking about, when it came to these fairly intricate
                    mechanisms, like, for example, the Paris Club.</p>
                <p>I had a tough time understanding the Paris Club for the first two years in the
                    job! But this was a young man who was terrified of Americans, terrified of his
                    responsibilities, terrified of his colleagues and eventually he wound up with a
                    lot to be terrified about, because he was slaughtered and literally butchered by
                    some of his fellow countrymen.</p>
                <p>But that's an extreme example perhaps of a troubled relationship. We never got it
                    right. It was always a difficult account. I went to Monrovia more times than I
                    ever imagined I would, trying to dig out of some of the problems, but it was
                    just very, very complicated because of our historical role there, the assumption
                    that Washington had a lot at stake, the reality of our commercial, intelligence
                    and other interests in the country.</p>
                <p>Other countries that we spent a lot of time on because they were important
                    relationships would be Sudan, Somalia, Zaire, as it then was, Congo today.</p>
                <p>But we also spent a lot of time with a number of the key francophone countries,
                    many of which were looking to diversify their relationships away from simply
                    relying on their French friends.</p>
                <p>So that was also very interesting and sometimes they would try to play us as an
                    alternative and play us against the French. We made it clear that we weren't in
                    that business. We weren't going to be played against the French.</p>
                <p>I'm thinking of Senegal and C�te d'Ivoire, Gabon and eventually
                    Congo-Brazzaville, as well as smaller countries which we worked with trying to
                    bring them into a better dialogue with us, like Mali, for example.</p>
                <p>I remember going to Mali with then Vice President George Herbert Walker Bush and
                    we had a great visit there and the Malians were eager to engage with us.</p>
                <p>Let me relate this to another policy front that we had and that was trying to
                    bring countries that had been, as you said, one party, but one party Marxist
                    states towards a less Marxist orientation.</p>
                <p>And there were a number of African countries by the mid-Eighties who were very
                    open to this and very interested and we worked hard, how can I put it, to “wean”
                    Marxists towards a more liberal economic model: Tanzania, Mozambique,
                    Congo-Brazzaville I've mentioned, Benin, Angola.</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>So we worked wherever we found countries that were at all open to having a
                    dialogue. I liked to say at the time that we would have good relations with any
                    African country that wanted to have good relations with us. By the mid-Eighties
                    most African countries really did want good relations with us. We had very few
                    totally poisoned relationships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it apparent by the mid-Eighties that the Soviet star
                        was fading rapidly, back in the home country and all and its influence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: George Herbert Walker Bush had to go to Moscow repeatedly to help bury
                    Soviet leaders. I saw him bury Brezhnev and then I saw him bury Andropov and
                    then he had to bury Chernenko. When we finally got to Gorbachev it was a breath
                    of fresh air.</p>
                <p>But he was the one who made your point most eloquently, because Gorbachev was
                    really stunningly eloquent about the need for, initially, perestroika, which is
                    of course the same thing, it's structural adjustment.</p>
                <p>And so I think a number of the African partners of Moscow were a little bit
                    worried about where this was going and what this meant for their relationship
                    with the Russians.</p>
                <p>The place we saw it most clearly was in the Mozambique dialogue, which was for us
                    very intensive and we were trying to bring our Mozambican friends into a close
                    relationship with us and other Western countries.</p>
                <p>Margaret Thatcher in the UK was doing a lot of that, working closely with Samora
                    Machel and then with Joaquim Chissano, his successor.</p>
                <p>And we saw very clearly that the Russians were not providing the kind of
                    patron-client support that the Mozambicans had relied on. So the Mozambicans,
                    they would have been open to almost anyone I think at that point.</p>
                <p>So, they saw the writing on the wall, but none of us, really, understood the full
                    extent of what became the Soviet collapse, not in '85.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Up to the time it collapsed, this wasn't in the cards for
                        any of us.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: No, including Gorbachev.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to what you've mentioned about the French, interviews
                        I've done over the years, so many of our ambassadors up through the early
                        Eighties and all to the francophone countries say the French were highly
                        suspicious of the Americans, because they didn't want us to poach on their
                        hunting reserve, as they termed it and our people spent a great deal of time
                        trying to assure the French that we didn't want to do anything in their
                        patch. But by the time you got there, we were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Oh, yes we were, but we were not doing something that was aimed at
                    undercutting France. We were pursuing our own interests and burden sharing, in
                    some cases.</p>
                <p>But it's a good point you raise. Look, I think the French political elite, policy
                    elite, never got over Suez, never got over Algeria, never got over the loss of
                    empire, in one sense, until very recently.</p>
                <p>There was a great sort of nostalgia for the kind of continuity of relationships
                    in Africa that they had had in the past. The best evidence of that is these
                    cooperation agreements, some of which still exist to this day, which give
                    remarkably tight linkages between Paris and the ex-colony, in all sectors:
                    telecommunications, defense, police, you name it, access to higher education
                    opportunities, access to uranium mining, just an amazing set of agreements.</p>
                <p>These were all signed in 1960 and the French were jealous of their chasse gard�e,
                    as they called it. They especially didn't want Anglo-Americans messing around in
                    their chasse gard�e.</p>
                <p>That was the initial reflex. By the time we got to the Eighties, which is the
                    period we're talking about, French officials, especially in the foreign ministry
                    and the aid ministry, or the cooperation ministry, as they call it, realized how
                    expensive Africa was for France and they realized that there could be benefits
                    in burden sharing.</p>
                <p>They didn't necessarily want the exclusive right to bail out French-speaking
                    Africa and they would be delighted if Uncle Sam would help them to sustain their
                    lead role in expensive countries like Senegal, as I've mentioned, or Cameroon.
                    They were always after us to try and help them in Cameroon or the Central
                    African Republic, which was the last thing we wanted to do. So there was a
                    little bit more sobriety by the mid-1980's.</p>
                <p>On the American side, to get back to your question, I often found American
                    diplomats, career or non-career, inclined to think that part of their job was to
                    push the French out of places where they had the lead role but I didn't accept
                    that, not for a minute.</p>
                <p>I've never understood why we would want to displace Europeans in Africa, because
                    why would we want to be number one? For what? Do we really want to own African
                    problems?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Doesn't that come with the job? If you're an ambassador in
                        a place, Americans kind of like to take charge</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I know.</p>

                    place like Gabon, you realize you're not number one, because the French have
                    that locked up.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Still on this subject, though, did you find our

                        interested a role as we did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>We sort of had the human rights hunting license, at least we thought we did and
                    did this sort of foul things up for normal relations with these countries?</p>
                <p>CROCKER: Perhaps in a few cases. We weren't leading with human rights as our
                    number one agenda, either. I'm trying to think of a good example.</p>
                <p>Perhaps Togo, under Eyad�ma, might be a example of what you're talking about,
                    where we would say, “My heavens, this doesn't pass the smell test and do we
                    really want to be printing money for the Eyad�ma regime? Why don't we let you
                    handle that one, Fran�ois?”</p>
                <p>But it would depend very much on the bilateral relationship I think as to whether
                    we led with human rights or not. You're right that the French didn't lead with
                    human rights anywhere.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I think an example that's quite interesting on all this, which leads to
                    the third dimension of our non-Southern African policies would be in Chad.</p>
                <p>Chad was a major front in the relationship between Black Africa and North Africa,
                    because of Libyan adventurism and expansionism.</p>
                <p>We saw Libyan activity in as many as twenty different African countries that I
                    would describe as subversive: Libyans renting, buying or suborning African
                    governments or political elites that were generally speaking quite weak and in
                    some cases open to Libyan diplomacy, unless we were pretty active.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>So we had a task there of trying to counter what we saw as unhelpful Libyan
                    behavior. I want to emphasize we did not equate Libya in any way with Soviet
                    activity. We never thought the Libyans were doing Soviet bidding or vice
                    versa.</p>
                <p>The Libyans had their own games, but they were playing games. They'd arrive in
                    countries that were in need to foreign exchange with brown envelopes full of
                    hundred dollar bills and try to insinuate themselves with the ministry of
                    fisheries or the ministry of culture and talk about building fancy mosques and
                    what they were really trying to do was to buy influence and sometimes to subvert
                    pro-Western governments.</p>
                <p>We saw it in Mali, we saw it in Niger, we saw it in Chad, of course, where they
                    were attacking and moving their forces into Chad. We saw it in Liberia, Senegal,
                    in lots of countries, Sudan as well.</p>
                <p>But the place where we dealt with it most dramatically, I guess you could say,
                    was probably in Chad. Going back to 1960, when Chad got its independence, there
                    really was never a time when there weren't some French forces in Chad. But a
                    whole series of small wars took place in the Seventies and the Eighties over
                    Libya's effort to claim part of northern Chad as their territory.</p>
                <p>Part of that claim was something called the Aouzou Strip, but it went beyond
                    that. They actually thought that a good part of northern Chad by rights ought to
                    be Libyan and they came up with their own version of colonial era maps and tried
                    to make the case.</p>
                <p>On a couple of occasions, in '85, '86 and early '87, they sent as many as seven
                    or eight thousand men into Chad, with three hundred tanks. This got serious, in
                    other words.</p>
                <p>Why I go into all this is because this was a challenge both to French interests
                    and to American interests and it's not a well documented story, but we worked
                    very closely, hand in glove, with the Chadians services, the Chadian military
                    and with the French services and the French military, through our Defense
                    Department and our services.</p>
                <p>I won't elaborate on that, but we used every tool we had in the toolkit to
                    reverse Libyan pressure and Libyan aggression, is what it really was, against
                    Chad and it was successful.</p>
                <p>The final phase of this was something called the “Toyota War,” which took place
                    in the early months of '87, I believe and the latter part of '86, in which tough
                    Chadian desert warriors, using Toyota Land Cruisers with rocket propelled
                    grenades, shoulder-launched missiles, got up into that northern area and
                    destroyed the Libyan armored forces, they just destroyed them.</p>
                <p>They circled them, they surrounded them, they cut them off from their supply
                    lines, they lost access to water and you saw a major defeat of Libyan armored
                    forces in the Chadian deserts of the north.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>This was an example of something I like to point to, not just because it's
                    interesting in the Chadian context but it's interesting in the U.S.-French
                    context: when you get away from the rhetoric that diplomats sometimes issued
                    towards each other, French and American and talk about practical military
                    cooperation, we worked very well with the French. And they were delighted, we
                    were delighted. It was a success story. One of my deputies, Jim Bishop, ought to
                    have earned several stars for our role in this campaign.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know in the late Seventies I was in Naples and I
                        remember talking to CINCSOUTH, Admiral Crowe, who got on splendidly with the
                        French Navy. I think the French and American military and intelligence work
                        very well together. The adults took care of things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, we saw some of that. Occasionally it worked. There are always
                    exceptions, but occasionally it worked very well and we were pleased when it
                    could work, because, as I've tried to indicate, we were not looking to be solo
                    out there.</p>
                <p>Africa's a big place. There's plenty of burdens to be shared.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: We did, indeed. My deputies and I would stop in at his office in the
                    �lys�e. It was always an amazing experience to us.</p>
                <p>He was known in Africa as “Papamadit,” because he would always go in to African
                    heads of state and begin his conversations by saying, “Mon pere m'a dit” and
                    then he would repeat what his dad had said. You'd hear a little speech from Jean
                    Christophe Mitterrand.</p>
                <p>He had the job of hand holding with regimes. He had a switchboard on his desk and
                    the lights kept going on and off and on and off and occasionally it would be one
                    that was green that he had to answer. And it was usually the minister of
                    education of some God-forsaken country, Central African Republic or whatever,
                    saying, “I need a bourse for my eldest son. Can you arrange?” That was the kind
                    of hand holding that I'm talking about.</p>
                <p>We thanked our stars that we didn't have those kinds of relationships across the
                    entire continent. But, anyway, we spent time with him, with the Quai d'Orsay,
                    with the cooperation ministry, with defense and with the DGSE, the intelligence
                    people, too.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the francophone countries and the Congo, Zaire at that
                        time, the Congo had been known as the CIA's country and you had Bill Casey
                        at CIA. How did the Congo fit in your work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, Congo or Zaire was very central to everything we were trying to
                    accomplish, because we didn't want instability. The last thing you want when
                    you're trying to conduct ambitious policies is a destabilization of an entire
                    region or sub-region.</p>
                <p>And clearly from our perspective the source of instability was economic weakness,
                    but it was also Russian meddling, or Russian-Cuban meddling, and sometimes
                    Libyan meddling.</p>
                <p>So Zaire was a firm ally or friend, if you like, in that context, but it was also
                    a very troubled government with a very corrupt leadership group.</p>
                <p>So we were caught in the horns of a dilemma there, between dealing with an
                    unattractive, one might say smelly, regime which had a poor human rights record
                    and poor economic management on the one hand, but which was an important partner
                    and an important source of regional stability.</p>
                <p>Zaire helped itself but helped us in a number of situations, vis-�-vis southern
                    Sudan, vis-�-vis Chad, there were Zairian troops sent up to Chad on a couple of
                    occasions, vis-�-vis Angola, particularly.</p>
                <p>And once we went back into the business of clandestine support for an opposition
                    movement in Angola, UNITA, Zaire was the way we did it, for the most part. Not
                    exclusively, but for the most part.</p>
                <p>So Zaire was a very, very complex and demanding relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to keep that relationship, in a Washington
                        context, in your hands?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: It was never that easy, because the clandestine relationship with their
                    services was under the hand of our clandestine service. And that kind of thing
                    can work if the principals are on the same page. But with Bill Casey they were
                    very seldom on the same page.</p>
                <p>Bill Casey saw himself as an alternative secretary of state in a number of
                    respects and had an independent policy, had his own policy and didn't
                    necessarily agree with the State Department's policy or for that matter with the
                    president's policy.</p>
                <p>So it was very difficult and I think you could say that Zaire was the place,
                    along with South Africa and one or two other places, where we had the biggest
                    problems with our friends and partners in the Agency.</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>We relied on them very much, because they had information channels that we were
                    dependent on. They also had some interesting analysis and intel. But they were
                    also an operating agency, with their own dollars and sometimes with their own
                    policy.</p>
                <p>We worked with them well in Chad. In Zaire it was more complicated.</p>
                <p>We would use the green phone to talk these things through and try to figure out
                    who was doing what with whom.</p>
                <p>But when I would go to Zaire, which I did more times than I care to remember,
                    there'd always be meetings with the head of state, with Mobutu, of course,
                    there'd be meetings with the foreign minister, meetings with the defense
                    minister, there'd be meetings with the head of Mobutu's services.</p>
                <p>And I would go into those meetings with people from the Agency as well as from
                    the embassy, from State, holding onto my wallet and making sure that notes were
                    taken that would be read my way. But it was interesting.</p>
                <p>One other relationship I should touch on, I think, because it absorbed a great
                    deal of our time, was Sudan, a country which bridges between sub-Saharan and
                    North Africa, between Africa and the Arab world.</p>
                <p>Because of Sudan's support for the Camp David peace process and because President
                    Nimeiri, as he then was, was doing some of the right things domestically, we
                    tried to work with him.</p>
                <p>He was a major aid recipient. But, frankly, he lost his way and he began in 1983
                    imposing an Islamist vision on his country, which caused him and us increasing
                    problems.</p>
                <p>So by the time he was overthrown, he was actually, I think, here, getting medical
                    treatment when he was overthrown in a bloodless coup d'etat, in 1985, from then
                    on that relationship began to sink and it still is sinking. It's been sinking
                    from '85 until today.</p>
                <p>Initially his successor was a moderate military officer who was not really very
                    Islamist oriented, but he was weak and he was succeeded by Sadiq al- Mahdi, who
                    was not above playing with Islamists when it served his interests, and then by
                    Omar Bashir, the current head of state, in another coup that took place in
                    1989.</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>But I mention this because we spent a lot of time on that relationship. We tried
                    to get the Sudanese regime in Khartoum to avoid this self-destructive policy in
                    the southern Sudan area which they pursued, of trying to break up the south with
                    a divide and rule policy and then to dominate it politically and to exploit the
                    oil resources of the south.</p>
                <p>We did what we could, but moving Sudan has always been a real challenge for
                    American policy. I never felt satisfied with what we were able to do. We would
                    open up humanitarian corridors to feed people in the south, but the government
                    would keep trying to close them down again. We tried to get the different
                    presidents of the country to see the point about political Islam being a
                    dangerous game.</p>
                <p>But I don't think we ever were able to accomplish everything we wanted. We got
                    some things done. We managed to use our relationship there to extricate tens of
                    thousand of Ethiopian Jews into Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Falasha.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: The Falasha community, as it was then called and that was a success, but
                    it was a rifle shot success. It was a humanitarian success, but it was not a
                    strategic success, in the broader sense of the relationship with Sudan and the
                    broad trendlines of Sudan's politics.</p>
                <p>One of the reasons we had such a tough time was that Ethiopia was so firmly in
                    the clutches of the Soviets at that time and we were unable to bring any
                    influence to bear from Sudan's neighbors.</p>
                <p>So the Sudanese regime in Khartoum would say to us, “Why are you pressing us? The
                    problem is over there.”</p>
                <p>And we would say, “We know there's a problem over there, but you've got to also
                    stop being self-destructive right here at home.”</p>
                <p>I mention this because I think Sudan has been a difficult challenge for assistant
                    secretaries of state for African affairs and for their colleagues in different
                    parts of our government for a long, long time and it still is today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, back to Zaire for a minute, did we see any
                        alternative to Mobutu? We're seeing now a horrendous civil war, sort of
                        warlords killing people and looting the country, but was this what we saw if
                        Mobutu wasn't there, or did we have hopes that something could develop that
                        would be more rational?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>CROCKER: Zaire or Congo was a deeply troubling dilemma. There were times when we
                    wished to bring greater pressure on Mobutu in order to steer him toward more
                    acceptable and cooperative behavior. But there were limits. We're talking about
                    an era in which the first question any assistant secretary would be asked by
                    superiors if he or she proposed thinking of alternative leadership in such
                    places was “What are you going to replace him with?” You can't replace something
                    with nothing. So you better have an answer to that question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that's the question I'm asking. Did there seem to be
                        anything? I'm told that Mobutu really knew at least how to pay off the
                        various elements and keep them more or less under control.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: He kept a form of stability in place while he was there, until he began
                    to lose his health in the Nineties, but he did it in destructive ways, by
                    misappropriating public funds, by steering resources to the elite that were
                    around him, by cutting off the country from international connections in many
                    ways, by cutting off the capital from the regional capitals. It was misrule,
                    pure and simple.</p>
                <p>So in a sense the only way he could communicate, or anyone else could
                    communicate, is by telephone or by airplane. So internal commerce was constantly
                    declining and what you had was local patronage systems in different parts of
                    this vast country, which is, as is often said, bigger than the U.S. east of the
                    Mississippi. It's a big place and getting around in it is very, very taxing and
                    time consuming.</p>
                <p>His way of governing Zaire perhaps probably had more to do with the era of
                    Eleanor of Aquitaine in France than it did with anything that we think of as
                    kind of twentieth century.</p>
                <p>We've seen how the European states were born and created and evolved from
                    principalities into larger units and really the business of the state was the
                    extraction of resources and the raising of armies. That's what European history
                    is all about, until modern times and this was the very beginning of a process of
                    state building.</p>
                <p>The alternative to trying to work with people like Mobutu was not self-evident.
                    There were some well meaning and fairly attractive politicians who said, “Well,
                    just support us in the elections and you'll see what good governance looks
                    like.” They didn't really add up to much, in our experience.</p>
                <p>So what we did not want to see was an empty chair in Zaire. And will say without
                    a moment's self-conscious reflection that we have no regrets about not leaving
                    an empty chair in Zaire during the Cold War period because I never figured out
                    an answer to that question.</p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>And still, to this day, as you're seeing, Kabila, Junior, Joseph Kabila, is a
                    well meaning, presentable, articulate and remarkably adept survivor but he's
                    surrounded by men who he's scared of. He's not really fully in control of his
                    country. He has no control in the eastern provinces that are in turmoil today,
                    in the Kivus and Oriental and in Ituri.</p>
                <p>He has no control. He has an army out there whose only raison d'etre is the
                    control of the payroll of their own forces. That's what they do, they control
                    the payroll and they live off of that. They don't have a force that is worthy of
                    the name.</p>
                <p>In that kind of situation, you look desperately for some points of strength to
                    latch onto. Mobutu was a very difficult character, he caused us a lot of
                    problems, caused his countrymen a lot of problems, but it was hard to see how we
                    would get from here to there, to a better political system.</p>
                <p>I'm not really answering your question because I never had an answer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are answering my question. And as we're talking in
                        2008, the answer seems to be there is not answer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, the answer may be that we have to find a way to let nature take
                    its course in some of these situations. Either that, or we have to intervene big
                    time. Right now there's 17,000 UN blue helmets in the force called MONUC and
                    they've just added another three thousand by Security Council action last week.
                    And I don't think that's enough.</p>
                <p>I think there needs to be about five thousand European troops added alongside the
                    UN troops and then engage in what I would call coercive disarmament of some of
                    these factions you just referred to and that's very robust foreign policy. I
                    don't know if we're up to it, or if Europe's up to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, let's move back to late '84 and you were
                        saying, rough times on constructive engagement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, yes, the beginning of 1985 saw developments of several kinds, saw
                    the breakdown of our diplomacy with Mozambique and South Africa, which was a
                    very important diplomatic opening that we had made leading to a kind of
                    demilitarization of the border and a de-escalation of tensions between
                    Mozambique and South Africa.</p>
                <p>That breakthrough took place in early '84 and by early '85 it had broken down. It
                    broke down because elements within the South African government destroyed
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>They escalated the support they were providing to RENAMO, the rebel movement in
                    Mozambique and they began basically not cooperating with the government of
                    Mozambique any more and we found ourselves unable to change their behavior,
                    partly because the left hand and the right hand weren't talking to each other
                    within the South African government.</p>
                <p>I remember going to one meeting with the South Africans, and in a sidebar we had
                    a quite lengthy discussion about Mozambique and how to get it back on track.</p>
                <p>And at the end of that meeting the head of South African military intelligence
                    who had not been in the meeting pulled on my sleeve and said, “Crocker, why are
                    you talking to them about Mozambique?,” 'them' being the foreign affairs
                    department. He said, “I run Mozambique.”</p>
                <p>So we were running into that problem a lot and we didn't have our own troops on
                    the ground anywhere in this region, I should emphasize. Our entire diplomacy in
                    Africa at this time was a diplomacy of using smart power, political tools,
                    negotiations, foreign assistance and very limited coercive power.</p>
                <p>So we weren't in a position to force the South Africans to behave if they were
                    determined not to behave and on Mozambique they appeared to be determined not to
                    behave.</p>
                <p>Then, of course, at the same time, we're talking about the period between roughly
                    November of '84 and March of '85, the urban unrest in South African began to
                    grow by the day and the South Africans were handling it very poorly.</p>
                <p>The Western media were having a field day and were reporting on the daily
                    brutalities in South Africa's urban areas. This was not a war. This was people
                    power challenging a government and the government cracking down on people power.
                    But it was well-organized people power and then you saw a lot of things that
                    were very unattractive.</p>
                <p>People who cooperated with the regime were burned to death ('necklaced' in
                    burning tires) in the black urban areas by activists and then the activists were
                    beaten up, killed, jailed and maimed and tortured by the regime. And this was
                    all being televised in prime time.</p>
                <p>So increasingly my job was to explain to the American people on American
                    television what the hell was going on in South Africa's urban areas and why did
                    we still have this policy of constructive engagement and why didn't we support
                    sanctions and so forth.</p>
                <p>So then the focus of discussion and debate in the U.S. increasingly focused on
                    the U.S.-South African bilateral relationship, with little discussion or
                    knowledge of our regional diplomatic efforts with Angola, Mozambique, Zimbabwe
                    and Namibia.</p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>A major movement had gotten underway in this country, led by a number of church
                    and labor and other organizations, to mount protest campaigns on American
                    campuses, as activists arranged media coverage of getting arrested outside the
                    South African embassy on Massachusetts Avenue.</p>
                <p>So I spent a good bit of my time explaining Ronald Reagan's policy of
                    constructive engagement, which was typically shorthanded as “constructive
                    engagement with apartheid South Africa,” which was not at all what the policy
                    was, but that's the way it was shorthanded.</p>
                <p>So I'd spend the first five minutes saying, “That's not the policy. The policy is
                    something different.” So it was a huge distraction, I guess is the right word
                    and we were placed somewhat on the defensive politically in this country, while
                    trying to sustain our regional efforts in Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ronald Reagan, did he weigh in at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yeah, he weighed in from time to time at press conferences. He provided
                    me with firm backstopping in both '85 and '86. He used language that I would not
                    have used sometimes in describing the situation there. And I think it's fair to
                    say that his graspof the brief was such that it didn't necessarily advance the
                    cause of defending our position.</p>
                <p>He viewed the South African regime as people who had been our allies in World War
                    One and World War Two and would talk that way, rather than talking about how we
                    sympathize with and we support the aspirations of the majority for a rightful
                    share of opportunity and power in their country.</p>
                <p>These were all very difficult code words which we had to work and clearly we
                    supported movement away from apartheid, but the way he would say it sometimes
                    did not necessarily make my job a lot easier.</p>
                <p>There were many, many public occasions for these discussions and debates. Let me
                    just say that in the first half of '85 we put in place some of our own
                    additional restrictive measures, sanctions, that were unilateral, imposed by the
                    Executive Branch, on the South Africans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of sanctions were these?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, these sanctions had to do with the travel of people to this
                    country, they had to do with investment guidelines. We talked a lot about the
                    importance of the Sullivan Principles and urged our companies to adhere to the
                    Sullivan Principles.</p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>But we firmly resisted mandatory disinvestment, argued against divestment by
                    institution investors, and we resisted trade sanctions, because trade sanctions,
                    of course, are an attack on the South African economy and on South African
                    workers. They're very indiscriminate. So we remained firmly opposed to them.</p>
                <p>But we had some restrictive measures that we put in place in '85. It didn't solve
                    the political problem here. This debate over South Africa continued right up
                    until around October of '86.</p>
                <p>There were different phases of the debate. In early 1986 Congress developed a
                    mandatory sanctions package, which was much more dramatic and included trade
                    sanctions and also sanctions against new investment. We were adamantly opposed
                    to those measures and President Reagan vetoed that legislation in the summer of
                    '86 and by the fall of '86 his veto had been overridden by the Congress.</p>
                <p>What I'm describing here is a two year struggle over South African policy. The
                    sanctions lobby won the sanctions debate and sanctions became one element of
                    American policy. We won our debate, in the sense that we never changed
                    constructive engagement for the simple reason that Congress could not dictate
                    the content of US diplomacy.</p>
                <p>So by '86 we were conducting a dual policy, the legislative one that was imposed
                    by Congress and one that was conducted by the administration, by the Executive
                    Branch. It was messy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this war, were you using your ground troops and
                        sending them out to be slaughtered, to go to universities, people from the
                        bureau, to talk to really kind of hostile crowds?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: We did a fair amount of public diplomacy, yes. It was only hostile in a
                    few parts of the country. God bless them, the citizens of northern California, I
                    remember dodging crowds out there on more than one occasion, but for the most
                    part we had a civil hearing.</p>
                <p>But there were protests in a lot of places. A lot of campuses, you had protests
                    which pressured the administration of universities to divest shares in companies
                    that were invested in South Africa.</p>
                <p>So it was like an investment portfolio sanction. Had no impact, really, on South
                    Africa. It had a big impact on American companies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, by the time you got this dual policy, what reaction
                        were you getting from the South Africans? Were they saying, “Well, you talk
                        one way and act another?”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>CROCKER: It was very complex for us. The South Africans didn't realize on some
                    occasions how deep a hole they were actually in. I remember one occasion, this
                    would have been in probably August of '85, I had a call from the South African
                    foreign minister saying, “Chase is pulling its credit lines.” They were not
                    rolling over the South African sovereign debt that they held. “You've gotta do
                    something.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Mr. Minister, I don't do sovereign credit lines. You have to talk to
                    your bankers about that one.”</p>
                <p>But from then on down South Africa basically lost its access to Western capital
                    markets and the best it could hope for was tightly restricted debt rollovers. It
                    got some revolvers from European markets. It didn't get much from American
                    banks.</p>
                <p>But the South African reaction was a combination of petulance, silliness,
                    ignorance and hand wringing. The last meeting I had with then State President
                    P.W. Botha took place in early '86. To give you a feel for the way he conducted
                    his conversations, he didn't cross the room to shake my hand and welcome me. He
                    stood across on his side of the room and waited for me to approach him and then
                    reluctantly shook my hand and said to me and I'm not making this up, “Why are
                    you here? I had a better relationship with the Carter Administration. At least I
                    understood where I stood with those people. With you I never know where I
                    stand.”</p>
                <p>And then he said to me, “Don't come and talk to me about sanctions and how you
                    need ammunition from me to fight your sanctions battles. Sanctions are your
                    problem. They're not my problem.”</p>
                <p>So that's the way he saw the issue. That was his understanding of reality.</p>
                <p>But basically the relationship was severely damaged by the combination of things
                    coming together at that time: sanctions, protest movement, the unrest inside
                    South Africa, Botha's inability to articulate a vision for the future.</p>
                <p>He gave a famous speech in the summer of '85 which was called the “Rubicon
                    speech,” but instead of crossing the Rubicon he fell into it. He gave a speech
                    with a vision for the future that led no where and the markets collapsed after
                    that. They lost their credit lines. They undercut those in western governments
                    trying to sustain the arguments on sanctions.</p>
                <p>But I think we should also explain what we contributed to this mess. We tried
                    very hard to deal with the Congress and with the American policy debate on
                    sanctions. Secretary Shultz gave speeches, Deputy Secretary Whitehead, a lot of
                    other people, gave testimony. I testified and spoke on television nonstop.</p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>But the time came in the summer of '86 for President Reagan to give a major
                    speech on South Africa in order to be able to sustain his veto of the most
                    recent sanctions bill. We went through about probably eleven drafts of that
                    speech and every time a draft went to the White House it came back rewritten and
                    it was rewritten by three people: by Pat Buchanan in the Communications Office;
                    by Bill Casey, the director of CIA; and by their friends in the South African
                    government.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These two you've named are well known as coming out of the

                <p>CROCKER: Fairly far to the right, the nativist right, or whatever you want to

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the third?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: People that they were working with inside the South African government,
                    one assumes in the state president's office or in military intelligence, who
                    were given our text by U.S. officials and then were rewriting it, using language
                    which, in some cases, looked like it had been translated directly out of
                    Afrikaans. It wasn't American English.</p>
                <p>So we realized what we were dealing with here was a loss of control inside the
                    White House of foreign policy and so Secretary Shultz and I had a battle on our
                    hands over the shape of a presidential speech defending our policies in Africa
                    and we lost that battle. The president gave a speech which lost the sanctions
                    debate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any friend in the White House, I'm thinking
                        the vice president or somebody at the NSC or anything like that or they
                        weren't effective, or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: They were not effective. We did have some friends in the NSC. We worked
                    with Bud Macfarlane and we worked with, I think, Poindexter. And we worked of
                    course with our Africa level staffers on the NSC. We also worked with the vice
                    president's office, but they didn't assert themselves on this issue.</p>
                <p>This was a speech drafting tug of war between the White House and the State
                    Department and the White House communications office won.</p>
                <p>The speech that the president gave in the summer of '86, it was mid-July, I
                    think, lost the sanctions debate. It lost the Senate Republicans. They got no
                    political cover with that speech. This was not a speech that gave the necessary
                    message to the American people..</p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>And so the veto was overridden and that drama played out until around October of
                    '86. It was a painful time and it undercut our diplomacy to some extent.</p>
                <p>Clearly the Angolans would look at all this and wonder what the hell is going on
                    in Washington? Are the Americans and South Africans going to be having a
                    divorce? Is this a great opportunity for us? Do we have to listen to the
                    Americans anymore, with all this going on?</p>
                <p>And meanwhile the South Africans were saying, “If that's your bloody policy,
                    don't bother to come and talk to us about regional diplomacy on Angola or
                    Namibia. We don't need to talk to you. And sanctions are your problem.”</p>
                <p>So I guess you could say '86 was the roughest year I had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you get much support from anywhere within the great
                        American media or the whole policy was a little too subtle?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: The policy was too subtle, when you had bumper stickers saying
                    “Sanctions Against Apartheid!” Constructive engagement wasn't about that. It was
                    about getting South Africa out of Namibia and Cubans out of Angola and keeping
                    South Africans out of Mozambique, by the way and keeping the Russians out of the
                    whole place. That's what it was about.</p>
                <p>We always understood that the sequence would be regional diplomacy first and then
                    South African change away from apartheid towards one man, one vote. That of
                    course is what eventually happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's awfully hard to sell to people who want simple
                        answers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: If people want simple answers, they'll get simple answers and what they
                    got was disinvestment, to some extent. They got the sanctions bill. They did not
                    change our policy.</p>
                <p>We continued to pursue our regional diplomacy and it ultimately prevailed. And
                    only after it had prevailed did you see the release of Mandela, the negotiations
                    for one man, one vote in South Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in a way, did the sanctions give you an added clout?
                        Even though you didn't want it, was this weakening the South Africans, or
                        stiffening their spines, or what was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>CROCKER: I think you really have to pick that apart, in terms of different time
                    periods. The initial reaction was, as you might expect, a nationalistic reflex
                    amongst white South Africans and especially Afrikaners, who ran the place.</p>
                <p>Of course it stiffened them. It made them angry.</p>
                <p>They felt let down. They couldn't believe that Ronald Reagan, their great friend,
                    would not be able to prevent this, or Margaret Thatcher, who also had to deal
                    with her sanctioneers at home and in the Commonwealth and Helmut Kohl in
                    Germany, who had to deal with his church groups.</p>
                <p>And they just couldn't believe that these Western leaders didn't have more
                    backbone. They didn't realize that whatever backbone we had was being severely
                    weakened by what South African security forces were doing in the black
                    townships.</p>
                <p>But in terms of finding people who understood the message, there were some in the
                    elite media who understood what we were trying to do, but it was hard even for
                    them and there were moderates among the Republican Party in the Senate who came
                    to us, like Senator Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas and Richard Lugar of Indiana, who
                    said to George Shultz, “You gotta do something” and we lost them on the
                    sanctions debate.</p>
                <p>And there is an Angolan side to the story that parallels the South African saga.
                    The point is there were developments on the Angola track at the same time that
                    led to the repeal of the Clark Amendment as we've discussed earlier, the
                    decision to provide covert aid to Savimbi and what that did to our Angolan
                    connections while we were having difficulty with our South African
                    connections.</p>
                <p>The American political right reacted to the sanctions movement against South
                    African by saying, “Let's have a sanctions movement against Angola! If they're
                    going to beat up on our friends, who helped us in World War One and Two and who
                    are staunch anticommunists, the white government of South Africa, if that's what
                    the Democrats are going to do, let's beat up on Marxist Angola and let's wage
                    war on them!”</p>
                <p>And so we saw a major movement amongst Republican conservatives to repeal the
                    Clark Amendment. The Clark Amendment banned any U.S. covert involvement in
                    Angola and it had been passed during the mid 1970's</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Carter Administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I think, in the final phase of the Ford Administration that it was put
                    in place, but, anyway, it had been there for some time.</p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>I never liked the Clark Amendment because it tied my hands. I always felt it was
                    better for us to be able to say to the Angolan leadership, “We do have options,”
                    wink, wink. But, anyway, our hands were tied.</p>
                <p>The Clark Amendment is repealed and within weeks Bill Casey comes over to the
                    State Department and says, “All right, time to go to war!”, literally and of
                    course we faced a lot of pressure from like-minded people inside the
                    administration to basically scrap the negotiations, or at least put them on ice
                    and begin developing a program of direct military support, clandestine support,
                    to Jonas Savimbi and UNITA, to bring pressure to bear against the government of
                    Angola, since they weren't moving as rapidly as we wanted towards a deal on
                    Cuban troop withdrawal.</p>
                <p>So we had a policy review. It was actually led by Bob Gates, who was Casey's
                    deputy, sitting in an NSC office, with NSC people, Defense people and State
                    people and we had that discussion and basically the outcome of that was that we
                    would indeed use the authorities that Congress had now granted us to develop a
                    modest program of covert support for UNITA.</p>
                <p>I'm not supposed to go into detail about this on the record, so I will not do so,
                    but I will just say that it was indeed a modest program. We tried to keep it
                    carefully focused on support of our diplomacy.</p>
                <p>What Casey and company wanted and by “and company” I mean like-minded officials
                    in Defense, in the White House, what they wanted was not to support our
                    diplomacy with power, but to replace our diplomacy with force.</p>
                <p>Some of these people never understood that diplomacy and power can be integrated.
                    They said, “It's either diplomacy or it's force and since diplomacy failed,
                    let's try force!”</p>
                <p>We'd ask them the question, “Do you really think that Jonas Savimbi's going to
                    ride into Luanda on tank columns, with South African support and American
                    clandestine support? I don't think so! Not as long as the Soviets are
                    around.”</p>
                <p>But they would argue back, “We'll bleed them!”</p>
                <p>And we would say back, “Why don't we try bleeding a few pilots, a few Cuban
                    pilots and Angolan pilots, rather than trying to bleed the Soviet Union, which
                    is a rather large target?”</p>
                <p>Anyway, eventually this rather modest program took shape and I think it probably
                    did make a difference at the margins, in sending signals. But we tried to keep
                    it under our own control throughout this period, sending signals to Luanda, to
                    Havana and to Moscow that, as Reagan liked to put it, America is back and if you
                    don't cooperate, we have alternatives. I believe it probably did play a
                    role.</p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also, when you think about it, it was somewhat the
                        equivalent to the contra effort in Nicaragua. “If you start a guerilla war,
                        we'll start a guerilla war.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, yes and we had another reason for being supportive, to some
                    extent, of this program and that was to reduce Savimbi's dependence on South
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>The South Africans wanted to control Savimbi. In fact, in many ways they did and
                    we felt that it was healthy for UNITA to have another pair of eyes and a window
                    on the world through us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you view Savimbi the person and where he was
                        coming from, at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: This is a long conversation. I would say in summary he was an acquired
                    taste.</p>
                <p>By the time we get to the middle of '86, we have military pressure against one of
                    our negotiating partners and economic sanctions against the other.</p>
                <p>And the question really is, did this strengthen our diplomacy, which you asked me
                    and I haven't fully answered, or did it undercut our diplomacy and what led to
                    the ultimate breakthroughs?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a three dimensional chess game, really and yet
                        Congress and everybody was looking at it on the basis of “What are you doing
                        about apartheid in South Africa?”, which really was not the main focus of
                        our policy at the time. We were trying to clear the field, I guess and get
                        the Cubans and Soviets out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes, it is a complex matrix sort of negotiation. I would say that the
                    issue of apartheid and how to end it was a fundamental part of the background of
                    the policy. In other words, it was part of the regional arena. It was part of
                    the geopolitical context.</p>
                <p>But, as we've said in these discussions, the key issue for us was sequencing and
                    getting some traction. The way we started to get that traction was on the
                    regional diplomacy and ending the regional wars, the assumption being that you
                    would not see the end of apartheid until the regional wars were concluded.</p>
                <p>That was our premise going in and yet, by the time we got into these heavy seas,
                    with lots of domestic and international debate, in '85-'86, as you just said, a
                    lot of people were saying, “Well, you're talking about Namibia and Angola and
                    Cubans and SWAPO and so forth, but what about the big kahuna?”</p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>The big kahuna is apartheid and to explain to people that you have to walk before
                    you run and that you have to clear away the underbrush before you can lay the
                    groundwork for dealing with the major issue, that was a complicated message.</p>
                <p>It didn't fit on a bumper sticker. What fit on a bumper sticker was “Sanctions
                    Now” or “Disinvest Now” or “Down With Constructive Engagement” or whatever you
                    like.</p>
                <p>So I spent a lot of time in those years we're talking about on the TV, including
                    the Sunday shows and so forth, explaining the president's policy and trying to
                    give the viewers some sense of the nuance. We had eventually let facts speak for
                    themselves and we had the debate and the rest was history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said “the president's policy.” How much did you feel
                        the president understood this, or you were given your head, or how did you
                        feel about this, sort of from the president's point of view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: The president supported his lieutenants in supporting his policy, which
                    was, as he defined it, by '86, it was to prevent sanctions. So he had a very
                    simple approach to this.</p>
                <p>He saw South Africa as a country that had been an ally in World War Two and in
                    Korea and so forth. He did not think that Marxist terrorists should take over
                    South Africa and I'm sure that there were people around him telling him that's
                    what the ANC represented, Marxist terrorists. His good friend Maggie Thatcher
                    often described them that way, too, as Marxist terrorists.</p>
                <p>So when people talked about the importance of the internal political dialogue in
                    South Africa, he would say, “Yes, but with whom?”</p>
                <p>So what I doing was trying to defend our negotiation, for all the reasons that I
                    understood to be necessary. Secretary Shultz certainly understood it that
                    way.</p>
                <p>But once you get into this kind of debate in Washington, it's a little bit of “us
                    versus them.” It's a little bit of the Executive keeping control of policy or
                    losing control of policy and the Congress saying, “You're not giving us enough
                    cover” or “We don't agree. You're not sending enough signals that your heart
                    beats for the victims of apartheid.”</p>
                <p>So that debate was not an easy one to prevail in. We prevailed the first time
                    around, in '85. We lost the debate in '86.</p>
                <p>And of course this was the time when we resumed our relationship of providing
                    support to UNITA and to Jonas Savimbi in Angola.</p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>In many ways if you look at all the so-called Reagan Doctrine conflicts or Reagan
                    Doctrine wars, I'm referring to Nicaragua, of course and Afghanistan and some
                    would add to that list, even though it's inaccurate, the Horn of Africa or
                    Cambodia, even, it was</p>
                <p>Angola that had a rebel with a major personality and major identity as a
                    historical figure. Why? Because he had been in the anti-Portuguese struggle from
                    the very beginning. He was one of the founding fathers of Angolan
                    nationalism.</p>
                <p>They got their story of struggle started in the 1960's. The MPLA, of course,
                    operated primarily out of Brazzaville and to some extent was seen as a
                    communist-oriented movement during the years before independence.</p>
                <p>Savimbi had gotten support in the early years from both Zaire and Zambia, to some
                    extent South Africa. His popular base was the Ovimbundu people, who represented
                    35, 40 per cent of the country, largely rural, largely uneducated, or less
                    educated, whereas the MPLA ruling elite liked to think of themselves as
                    representing the more advanced urban dwellers, the mestico or mixed race
                    community and those who were near to the coast.</p>
                <p>Savimbi had all kind of credentials. He was very well spoken. He was a good
                    public speaker. He was a good rabble rouser.</p>
                <p>There's excellent footage in the archives of him addressing audiences of think
                    tanks in Washington, in Germany and London, as well as addressing his own troops
                    in the field in southern and central Angola.</p>
                <p>He was not bashful in front of microphones. He liked to hold the stage. He was
                    charismatic, in the real sense of the word.</p>
                <p>He was capable of holding an audience, in at least four languages, probably more,
                    although I don't think I ever learned all of them: several African languages, as
                    well as French and Portuguese, English and some German, did his studies in
                    German-speaking Switzerland.</p>
                <p>So this is a fellow who had been around the world and in that sense was quite
                    worldly. He cultivated relationships with all kinds of leaders around the world,
                    including all over Africa. He had quite an active diplomacy and he received
                    support from places that wouldn't surprise you: more conservatively oriented or
                    anti-communist oriented like Morocco and Togo and C�te d'Ivoire and at various
                    times Kenya and Zambia and so forth, the list went on.</p>
                <p>And of course Zaire, today's DRC. I say “of course” because without the DRC I
                    don't think that Savimbi would have been geopolitically able to sustain his
                    effort over those many years.</p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>What was he like as a person? I'm not sure I ever got that close to him. I
                    wouldn't presume to think I got that close to him.</p>
                <p>We did take a number of walks in the woods, so to speak, outside of conference
                    sites and meeting facilities, because wherever we met, except in Washington, we
                    were subject to electronic surveillance, we knew it. If we were being hosted by
                    the South Africans, we knew we were being bugged and intercepted or wired.</p>
                <p>If we were meeting in Zaire, we knew that Mobutu was wiring us and of course that
                    had its own complications, because Mobutu's wiring services were connected to
                    his intelligence apparatus, which in turn was connected to our intelligence
                    apparatus. Therefore if I was talking to Savimbi I was talking to Langley and I
                    was aware of that.</p>
                <p>But we occasionally met each other in other places, like Washington, where we
                    presumably were not being wired.</p>
                <p>In any event, we had these man-to-man chats about things from time to time. I had
                    the sense of somebody who would have liked to be able to return to normal
                    politics and to have his family be able to live in normal conditions and he had
                    children. But normal life would have to come on his terms and his terms were
                    pretty severe.</p>
                <p>He saw himself, as I've indicated, as one of the George Washingtons of Angola and
                    by the time we're talking about, the mid-Eighties, the other George Washingtons
                    were either dead or marginalized.</p>
                <p>And he found it very difficult to imagine sharing power with the kind of people
                    who were then in power in Luanda, because he saw them as lesser personalities or
                    as fronts for somebody else. He didn't take them very seriously and he didn't
                    trust them.</p>
                <p>He assumed that if he came back home to Luanda and tried to live a normal life
                    there that he'd be killed and he was quite possibly right. And he assumed that,
                    I think, because that's what he would do if he were in the MPLA's shoes.</p>
                <p>This man was a charismatic figure, a rebel, an insurgent. He came out of a
                    pro-Chinese background in the Cold War years. The Chinese had given him support
                    when he was fighting the Portuguese, whereas the Soviets had supported the
                    MPLA.</p>
                <p>But by the time we're talking about he was a self-declared pro-Western freedom
                    fighter and he understood the art form of being a chameleon about as well as
                    anybody I've every met. He felt very at home in Ronald Reagan's White House,
                    which he visited on several occasions. He presented wooden mockups of captured
                    AK-47's to various senior officials. So he was a man for all seasons, you'd
                    say.</p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>But he was also a warlord and a quite effective battlefield commander and
                    strategist, in the conventional sense of a military commander.</p>
                <p>Beyond that, he was also a worried man and sometimes I think a very paranoid man,
                    who tended to surround himself with yes men and he listened to those who were
                    around him. That's what people tend to do.</p>
                <p>When he was surrounded by good people, he often made good decisions. When he was
                    surrounded by bad people, or no outside voices at all, he tended to make very
                    bad decisions.</p>
                <p>And of course I think the record will show that he was, among his many other
                    attributes, a killer. He was responsible personally for the deaths of a number
                    of his own senior colleagues who did something at one stage or another that led
                    him to be distrustful and he wiped them out.</p>
                <p>So this is a man with many aspects to his history. I would not have wanted to
                    live under Jonas Savimbi. And whenever my people were in his company, on his
                    territory, I didn't sleep well.</p>
                <p>But I would quickly add I wouldn't want to have lived under any of the Angolan
                    leadership I was dealing with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the MPLA leadership at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: It was more collegial, whereas Savimbi was very much of a “big man”.
                    Jos� Eduardo dos Santos came into power in 1979 as a somewhat unproven and young
                    consensus candidate that I think other factions in the MPLA party thought could
                    control him.</p>
                <p>But over the course of years, including right up to today, he has outlasted and
                    outsmarted and outmaneuvered quite a number of people. He's very bright, very
                    quick, well spoken, smooth.</p>
                <p>If you had to define him as a Marxist, you would say he was a Yves Saint Laurent
                    Marxist. He liked good things and his family has come to enjoy good things in
                    life and there's terrific amounts of wealth in the hands of the dos Santos
                    family today. We're talking about the aristocracy of an oil producing country
                    that has done very well for itself.</p>
                <p>But an engaging conversation partner and somebody with a sense of humor. You
                    could have low key conversation and I often did with Jos� Eduardo dos Santos. He
                    was personable. He had some charm and he spoke in a conversational tone.</p>
                <p>When you spoke with Savimbi, you thought you were speaking to a warlord, as
                    indeed you were, quite a different atmosphere.</p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>Surrounding dos Santos there were elements that were close to him from the
                    military. There were various people who were his close military advisors who had
                    been with him in the struggle at one stage or another, or had been commanders of
                    certain parts of the armed forces. This was a military-based regime and whether
                    the person was the defense minister, Kito Rodriques, as we called him, or the
                    chief of the defense staff, General Ndalu, these were people who were among his
                    closest advisors.</p>
                <p>But there were many other advisors, including people more on the party, political
                    side and the intelligence side and people in the foreign ministry. But I never
                    thought, after the first year or so, the foreign ministry was an important place
                    of power in the Angolan spectrum.</p>
                <p>I think I should add here that as you get to know a regime or a country you begin
                    to start differentiating all of the people you meet there and you begin to
                    realize that you're not dealing with an abstraction or a stereotype or a clich�,
                    you're dealing with individuals and you begin to assert that what matters is not
                    that you met with a title, but that you met with a person and that personality
                    made all the difference.</p>
                <p>If we had good meetings, they were with the right people and if we had
                    unsuccessful meetings, they were usually with the wrong people.</p>
                <p>As you know, we had no relations with Angola, so setting up meetings with the
                    Angolans was complicated. On the UNITA side, we had to set them up through Zaire
                    or through South Africa, unless they were traveling to some third country like
                    C�te d'Ivoire or occasionally to Washington.</p>
                <p>In the case of the MPLA, we would meet them often in Angola, or equally often in
                    Cape Verde or sometimes in Mozambique. The fellow Portuguese-speaking countries
                    were very close sister countries, if you like, to Angola, so we would often meet
                    the Angolans under the hospitality of the Cape Verdeans, who were wonderful
                    hosts and did everything they could to facilitate this process.</p>
                <p>But I just would make the point that individuals make a difference. I wouldn't
                    attribute our eventual success with the Angolans to any one of them, because I
                    don't think any one of them was in a position to assert himself to become
                    completely the counterpart of the South Africans in this three-cornered
                    decision-making process. They were at that time very, very dependent on their
                    socialist brothers, especially their Cuban socialist brothers, but also their
                    Russian partners.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the Cuban attitude towards these
                        negotiations? Were they trying to screw things up, or what was
                        happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>CROCKER: There was no question that the Cubans were listening in on all of our
                    conversations with the Angolans. They were in the next room, so to speak and
                    they had the ability to do that and one of our key negotiating partners in the
                    Angolan government, I have no doubt, was working for the Cubans, and I think he
                    saw that in fact as a genuine alliance.</p>
                <p>So the Cubans, we didn't talk to directly during the years that we're talking
                    about. We didn't have direct contact with them over these negotiations, really,
                    until 1987.</p>
                <p>But there had been some other contacts. General Vernon Walters had been to Havana
                    in the early Eighties to put down some markers and to make a few points about
                    worldwide issues and he did touch upon Southern Africa during those
                    contacts.</p>
                <p>We would sometimes hear the argument that we really should be talking to the
                    Cubans or that we should be allowing them to join the talks, if they wanted to.
                    We were given to believe that might make a difference from some of our Angolan
                    interlocutors and from third parties, the French or Mozambicans or whatever.</p>
                <p>In the years we're talking about, which is the mid-Eighties, our position, for
                    good or not, was “What kind of an African country are you if you can't negotiate
                    for yourself? Would you really want us to sit down, we the United States and
                    negotiate over your head with your Cuban allies, or with your Soviet
                    allies?”</p>
                <p>And we would say to them, in order to see if we couldn't trigger a nationalist
                    reflex, we would say to them very bluntly, “Do you really want us to take this
                    to Moscow and Havana and you'll read about the results in the newspaper, or do
                    you want to behave like an independent African country, which some people think
                    you are?”</p>
                <p>On occasion we would find a diplomatic way to say pretty blunt stuff like that,
                    to see if we couldn't get them to move forward.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It also makes sense, looking at it long range, for our
                        dealing with a situation. Who knows what the third parties will do and all
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Right, they bring their own agenda in, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of reaction would you get?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, we got the right reaction, but it didn't necessarily mean that it
                    was real. They said what they felt they had to say.</p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>This process did not get into high gear until the Cubans did join the talks,
                    which has often led people to ask the question, “Well, would it have made a
                    difference if you'd been able to have a Cuban dialogue alongside, in parallel,
                    or something?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we excluding the Cubans at the early stages by reason
                        that we didn't think it was a good idea, that we wanted to deal with the
                        real people who were involved, who were going to be concerned over the
                        years, or was this dictated by the Cuban lobby, or whatever you want to call
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Dealing with the Cubans is a very controversial issue. Certainly it was
                    then. Still is. And I would have needed presidential air cover if I was going to
                    be talking to the Cubans and there would need to be a reason why.</p>
                <p>So we occasionally, within my own team, would talk about that factor and how to
                    play it, but we didn't think that we would succeed if we raised the issue to the
                    secretary of state or the president, in getting approval to do it, in the
                    absence of some evidence that the Cubans were interested in peace and might make
                    a positive contribution.</p>
                <p>Well, you get into that kind of a game, where people were saying, “They've got to
                    demonstrate that they are serious” or “We need a precondition. Something has to
                    change.”</p>
                <p>I've always been a believer that these things are basically reciprocal processes.
                    Preconditions don't work very well.</p>
                <p>And mind you the Cubans, in the years we're talking about, had not come to us
                    directly and said, “Invite us to join your talks.” They never did that. Anything
                    we ever heard was through interpreters, by third and fourth parties. It wasn't
                    direct. Havana wasn't sending us a specific message.</p>
                <p>Nor were the Angolans. They would hint about it and they would say that the
                    Cubans have pride and that they need to be consulted, but they never said, “We
                    won't talk to you on this subject again unless the Cubans are in the room.” They
                    never said that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>So it would have required us to initiate that opening to the Cubans on this
                    question, at a time we were fighting Cuban proxies in Central America and, as
                    you said, there was a Cuban lobby.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And at least for the short term it would have allowed
                        Castro to make a wonderful speech or something like that. When you open
                        these things up, we discovered with the Iranians, they never miss a chance
                        to sort of stick their thumb in our eye, even if it's to their disadvantage

                <p>CROCKER: That's right, so we didn't develop that Cuban track in the years that we
                    are now talking about, '85,'86.</p>
                <p>If we had a Cuban track, it was to channel clandestine support to UNITA,
                    including surface to air missiles. That was something of a Cuban track, because
                    the main pilots who would feel the impact of that would be Cuban pilots. The
                    Angolan pilots tended to be members of the elite from the MPLA and the Cuban
                    pilots were some of Castro's best.</p>
                <p>But they were aware of the fact, by the end of '86 and early '87, that we were in
                    fact supplying UNITA with Stingers. That's in the public record, so I'm not
                    violating the rules here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the people at whom we were firing the missiles were
                        quite aware this was not something developed out in the bush of Angola. They
                        realized technology was a little more sophisticated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>In Afghanistan the Stingers did appear to have made considerable difference. How
                    about in Angola?</p>
                <p>CROCKER: It's sort of asymmetric warfare, if you like. Our program of assistance
                    to UNITA was tiny. It never became anything bigger than tiny.</p>
                <p>It was miniscule compared to what South Africa was providing for UNITA and what
                    UNITA was providing for itself by capturing MPLA equipment by the shipload,
                    unbelievable amounts of Soviet-supplied hardware fell into UNITA's hands,
                    because UNITA was a very effective insurgency movement at that time and ran
                    circles around the MPLA, or FAPLA, the army of Angola.</p>
                <p>And of course the Soviet supplies directly to Angola were between one and two
                    billion dollars a year and our own effort was minor.</p>
                <p>But I think it sent a signal, in the asymmetric sense that as Ronald Reagan
                    himself would have liked to have put it and did, “America is back.” It sent a
                    signal that this conflict is not going to be settled on terms that we don't
                    agree with and it raised the price at the margins.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was happening politically during this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Politically, in the negotiations?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And in Congress.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, some of the key dates: Congress lifted the Clark Amendment in the
                    summer of '85 and by February of '86 the internal administration discussions had
                    concluded and we had begun providing covert support of a modest type to
                    UNITA.</p>
                <p>This whole debate, of course, was not very quiet. When the president was doing
                    one of his walk-bys to his helicopter and the press was staked out, one
                    journalist yelled to him, I think it may have been November or December of '85,
                    probably Sam Donaldson, “Mr. President, I thought you supported UNITA. What are
                    you going to do to support UNITA against the communist regime in Angola?”</p>
                <p>And the president said, “Oh, yes, but we're going to do it covertly!”</p>
                <p>So this was pretty well known. The Angolan leadership, the MPLA leadership,
                    assumed that we were doing so even before we were and criticized and attacked us
                    for doing it even before we were, and they had a lot of support from other
                    African governments and there were UN resolutions and a lot of hoopla.</p>
                <p>The Soviets mobilized their global propaganda apparatus, attacking the Reagan
                    Administration for pretending to negotiate peace in Southern Africa while
                    fueling the war, which of course anyone who knew their facts knew that that was
                    a bit of a joke, since this was a Soviet militarized region by this point.</p>
                <p>The Angolan leadership , by the middle of '86, was saying that it probably could
                    no longer negotiate with us, it would have to suspend the talks, it needed to
                    know what America's intentions were and so forth. So this had a chilling effect
                    on the diplomatic track with the Angolans at that immediate time.</p>
                <p>And I should mention that in 1985 the South Africans had put forward a
                    conditional proposal on Cuban troop withdrawal which they wanted us to convey to
                    the Angolan side, which we did and we did it in late '85.</p>
                <p>By the middle of '86 the Angolans had still refused to answer that mail. They
                    simply were not prepared to dignify the South African bid, as we called it. So
                    we were not in a position to push very hard on the Angolans at this point.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, by May of '86, the Congress, in its wisdom and looking at what's going
                    on on the ground in South Africa, had begun another series of hearings and
                    writing up a new sanctions bill to basically have pretty comprehensive economic
                    sanctions against South Africa, both trade and investment.</p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>That sanctions bill was developed and marked up in the Senate and there were
                    parallel bills in the House. When the legislation finally came to the
                    president's desk, in the summer of '86, he was unhappy, to put it mildly.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned in a previous interview, what we had tried to do was to preempt
                    that sanctions legislation with our initiatives that would include sanctions of
                    our choosing, rather than the comprehensive, full scope, as we called them
                    indiscriminate, trade war kind of sanctions that were in that bill.</p>
                <p>That bill was really, in some ways, a maximal effort to declare economic war on a
                    country and put a lot of people out of work, most of them black, of course.</p>
                <p>It had elements of protectionism in it, by banning imports of things that the
                    United States itself was a producer of; basically it was a measure which any
                    believer in good trade policy would not have supported.</p>
                <p>There were parts of the bill that we could support, so we tried to, if you like,
                    we tried to cherry pick the bill and put forward another sanctions initiative of
                    our own.</p>
                <p>We had had a round of limited sanctions, executive order sanctions, in '85 but
                    things had moved on, we would have to do more in '86 to provide any hope of
                    preempting the congressional legislation.</p>
                <p>But this led to a serious interagency battle and the State Department was
                    probably the only voice in that battle that thought we'd have to make a major
                    down payment of sanctions to be able to forestall the congressional
                    initiative.</p>
                <p>This is a very intricate and complicated story. It's been documented in various
                    places, including my own memoir, but the simple point I would make is that by
                    this time, by May, June, July of '86, the sanctions debate had become a struggle
                    between two branches of government over the definition of our South African
                    policy.</p>
                <p>The Congress wanted more cover, in terms of leadership, on the issue of apartheid
                    than Ronald Reagan was capable or willing to provide. So the president's effort
                    to sustain his view of the situation was ultimately unsuccessful. He vetoed the
                    congressional legislation and then the Congress came back after the August
                    recess and overrode his veto, which was I think the first time that happened in
                    his presidency.</p>
                <p>So it was a big deal. It was a setback and a huge distraction, from what we were
                    trying to do, which was to negotiate regional peace.</p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>It was focused all on the internal South African situation and on Ronald Reagan's
                    perceived failure to identify himself, his administration and the United States
                    with the victims of apartheid. That's the story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the leaders in Congress, or outside of Congress,
                        opinion molders and all that you were sort of up against?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, it changed over time. I think there were people in what we would
                    have called the anti-apartheid lobby group within Congress who'd been there for
                    many years, like Congressman Bill Grey, for example, of Pennsylvania.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of the Black Caucus.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes and another would have been Congressman Ron Dellums from California.
                    On the Senate side, the Senate was Republican-controlled at that time, but we
                    kind of faced a situation, we in the State Department, where our friends in the
                    Senate, namely Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, who was the Senate African
                    subcommittee chair and Richard Lugar, the chairman of the Senate Foreign
                    Relations Committee, they were looking for more cover, if you want to put it
                    that way, than we were capable of getting out of the White House.</p>
                <p>This would not have happened if we had been able to move the White House closer
                    to the position that George Shultz and I were advocating. We didn't succeed as
                    I've described above.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, when you say “the White House,” does this mean the
                        president, does this mean the national security advisor? Are there powers
                        within the White House, or what are you talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I'm talking about the voices around the president and there were varied
                    voices around the president. Bill Casey, of course, was one of those voices and
                    he had an office in the White House and spent time there and could influence
                    things and often did.</p>
                <p>Bill Casey was a true soul brother of Ronald Reagan on this issue and was
                    determined to oppose any measures, what you might call partial measures, of the
                    kind that we're talking about, more targeted sanctions, for example, on banking
                    or on new investment and that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>And of course Bill Casey and the Agency were running the liaison relationship
                    with the South African services, which they saw as allies in a Cold War context
                    and they used their sources and relations to oppose or discredit the steps that
                    we put forward.</p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>They didn't do so to our faces. They did it behind our backs.</p>
                <p>He had a very agile and active ally in Pat Buchanan, the president's
                    communications director, who saw the world in the same terms, as black and
                    white.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about '86</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: The summer of '86.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And we're talking about a Soviet Union that's in its last
                        five years of existence and within a couple of years of complete disinterest
                        in Africa. But was any of that reflected in what was going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: There was really no evidence of a Soviet shift or a Soviet rethink on
                    this situation at that time. But if there had been one, we may find from the
                    Soviet archives that there had been one, but if so I didn't see it.</p>
                <p>And when you think about events like the Reykjavik summit of October '86, which
                    was going on right after the Congressional sanctions bill passed and you imagine
                    that the two leaders, Reagan and Gorbachev, are talking about a lot of different
                    but mostly they were talking about was nuclear weapons and Star Wars and all the
                    rest, which were very, very important bilateral strategic issues. They were not
                    talking about Afghanistan. They were not talking about Angola.</p>
                <p>But there had been an earlier conversation, I think it was Reagan's first real
                    meeting with Gorbachev, in November 1985, in which they touched on a variety of
                    issues and they had an exchange on what was called “the regional conflict
                    agenda.”</p>
                <p>They didn't solve anything, there was no real progress, but there was a
                    recognition that this was a basket of issues that would be worth talking about
                    at some point.</p>
                <p>So you had arms control, human rights, and issues of regional conflict. But even
                    within the regional conflict agenda, the number one issue, far and away, would
                    have been Afghanistan, because that was Soviet bleeding wound, not Angola.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of your problem with William Casey, the head of
                        the CIA, during this period here that we're dealing with, did you feel that
                        you were getting good or was it tainted information from the CIA, regarding
                        what was happening, because you're negotiating, you want to find out where
                        the people you're negotiating with, what are their stands and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>Were you getting anything?</p>
                <p>CROCKER: As you know, the CIA has two elements to it: it has an analytical house
                    and it has an operations house and we were in touch with both parts of the
                    house.</p>
                <p>They often had some differences, some nuances. But where it came out and became
                    visible to us was on issues that were highly contentious between the two
                    buildings, State and CIA. Angola was one of those. Mozambique was another
                    one.</p>
                <p>We would have very extensive back and forth over reporting by the Agency on
                    Mozambique, particularly. I remember being in Shultz's office, he would meet
                    weekly with Bill Casey, and he called me up for one of these meetings and Casey
                    brought one of his people.</p>
                <p>Shultz said, “I've had enough of this back and forth. What are the facts
                    here?”</p>
                <p>We just had a real difference of analysis. The South Africans were basically
                    spreading the story and arguing that the RENAMO rebel movement was the proper
                    government for Mozambique and that we should get on the side of RENAMO and help
                    it overthrow FRELIMO. This would have been 1980s style regime change.</p>
                <p>We, along with the British, were diametrically opposed to that and fought
                    successfully to prevent the United States from aligning itself with RENAMO and
                    staying with a gradually warming relationship with the FRELIMO government of
                    Mozambique.</p>
                <p>So, we knew we had a problem on some of these accounts. I think also we knew we
                    were being manipulated when it came to our diplomacy in Zaire, because Zaire was
                    one of the major CIA stations in Africa at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Zaire was known in the Foreign Service as a “CIA
                        country.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: It was very definitely a CIA country. But that didn't mean that we were
                    prepared to let that go unchallenged.</p>
                <p>We at the State Department faced an eight-year struggle for the control of
                    American foreign policy on these issues. We prevailed, but we lost some battles
                    along the way.</p>
                <p>People often say, “Well, did you know about that? Did you know that Casey was
                    going down and having these secret meetings with people in Africa and so
                    forth?”</p>
                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>We often knew that he was there. We were never in the room. We were not
                    consulted. We didn't get readouts or memcons. But we knew they were going on,
                    and we could guess what was being said. It was a standing office joke that Casey
                    had told an aide he thought former Sudanese vice president Omar al-Tayib was
                    'the sweetest guy in Africa'; it didn't hurt that he was a liaison
                    counterpart.</p>
                <p>So we saw things through a glass darkly, often. But the agency operators were
                    also somewhat in the dark about what we were doing. They were not in a position
                    to prevent what we were doing.</p>
                <p>While they took their battles to the president and they may have won a few, we
                    won the war. And one of the reasons was we had people on the team dedicated to
                    winning it and to fighting it seven days a week, 24 hours a day. There was a
                    real sense of intense commitment to making our diplomacy work.</p>
                <p>So even though, let's say, Zaire was a CIA country, that didn't mean we didn't go
                    to Zaire and push our message. Our negotiating team, my incredibly able
                    deputies, our ambassadors and Africa watchers in the field fought that battle
                    and we had allies in fighting it.I don't mean to imply that this was just State
                    all by itself, or the African bureau of State all by itself. I wonder if we
                    could have managed this diplomacy without the British. They were with us. They
                    understood what we were doing from day one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was any of this conflict that was going on, CIA-State,
                        were the counterpart agencies in the British government involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: The British have less slack in their system and they don't, as a rule,
                    tend to tolerate that kind of intramural indiscipline.</p>
                <p>In fact I had to set up, in effect, my own intelligence contact staff , with a
                    couple of people who would talk to individuals in our own intel structure to
                    triangulate what they knew, and talk offline with British intelligence and we'd
                    talk to other intelligence services offline: German, French, whatever.</p>
                <p>We'd do what we had to do to get the information we had to get. So I don't know
                    whether others were aware of that at the time. We felt that we were getting good
                    input from both MI6 and the Foreign Office.</p>

                    <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that within the CIA, particularly on
                        the analytical side, these came from sort of the same sources you came from,
                        sort of with an academic background, looking at this thing with sort of the
                        same outlook. They might have had a cold, hard, Cold Warrior in Bill Casey,
                        but I would have thought there would have been allies within the Evil
                        Empire.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I hope I haven't conveyed the impression that the Agency was monolithic
                    or that it was all on one side. As I said earlier, we talked with a wide range
                    of individuals in the intel community to get the best information, the least
                    polluted stuff, the insights of the brightest people. I'm really talking about
                    those folks who were in a position to politicize intelligence, fairly senior
                    people and those folks in some of the stations who were doing their bidding,
                    they were doing the bidding of the senior ranks among the operational side of
                    the Agency.</p>
                <p>But we had a lot of daily interaction with the analytical people and with some of
                    the operational people who were willing to deal with us.</p>
                <p>We had weekly meetings with my operational counterpart. We'd talk about the
                    entire region. We'd also talk about some of this Southern African stuff and
                    where we'd disagree we disagreed.</p>
                <p>But your point is well taken. We had important allies on the analytical side and
                    they would often support the State view, or their view, vis-�-vis folks in DIA,
                    who might have a more one-dimensional alternative.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, they also had a drop box called the Washington Times and whenever
                    they had an unfinished intelligence product that they were proud of it would
                    wind up in the in-box of some editor or journalist working in the Washington
                    Times.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, I really can't speak for Secretary Shultz on this, but my sense
                    was that Shultz realized and if you read him memoir there's whole sections of
                    the memoir about this very issue, that there was a struggle going on here that
                    was not being resolved in the White House, a struggle over who is the
                    president's voice on different issues.</p>
                <p>And that was partly Weinberger and it was partly Casey and it wasn't resolved
                    until Iran-Contra, until the death of Bill Casey. It wasn't resolved 'til the
                    administration's Augean stables got cleaned.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How stood Mozambique? Was this part of the situation, or

                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I think, looking back, the worst month of my tenure was October of 1986,
                    which was the month right after the override of the president's sanctions bill,
                    which made it look, in the eyes of many, that our policy was going to change
                    dramatically, even though we knew it wasn't. The administration was not going to
                    drop the policy of negotiation in Southern Africa, we were going to continue
                    doing exactly what we had been doing, but we're going to do it against the
                    backdrop of having lost a major debate.It somewhat hamstrung us. I made it look
                    to various people that our policy had been either defeated or fundamentally
                    changed.</p>
                <p>So there was that backdrop. The South Africans had gone into kind of a retreat,
                    politically speaking and diplomatically speaking. They didn't want to talk to
                    us. They in fact said at one point that there'd be no more meetings to discuss
                    these negotiations.</p>
                <p>And in fact it became such that I think it was difficult for the “good guys” in
                    the South African government to be seen talking to the State Department right
                    after that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it the feeling that we were seen as weak?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Partly that. They knew all about the controversy on the speech drafts
                    back in July of '86. Some of them were writing it.</p>
                <p>They knew all about the interim sanctions that we had tried to put forward to
                    preempt the legislative package called the “Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act,”
                    the “CAAA” as it became known.</p>
                <p>So they knew what we had tried to do and they knew that we had not succeeded and
                    they knew why we had not succeeded and they just didn't want to have anything
                    much to do with us.</p>
                <p>So October of '86 was gloomy. It didn't stop us from doing some things we were
                    determined to do, which was to work with like-minded allies to prevent a
                    complete shutdown of the South African economy. We worked very quietly behind
                    the scenes to make sure that South Africa did not lose all of its access to bank
                    credit rollovers and that kind of thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>But the other reason why October was pretty grim was that on October 19th of 1986
                    Samora Michel, the president of Mozambique, went down in a plane crash. His
                    plane went into mountains along the South African-Mozambique border, under
                    stormy weather condition. He was in a Soviet plane flown by, Soviet pilots.</p>
                <p>And so we had lost a major partner and a figure who had a lot of credibility in
                    Africa and certainly a lot of credibility in that region as well as in
                    Washington and Whitehall.</p>
                <p>And this at the time seemed like a pretty major blow. It was a gloomy month,
                    October of '86. The MPLA regime in Angola was saying that there wasn't much to
                    talk about if we were waging war against them (aid to UNITA) and so forth. So
                    this was a time for hunkering down, for doing everything possible to sustain the
                    framework that we had built up.</p>
                <p>Don't forget we had opening bids from the two sides on a schedule for Cuban
                    withdrawal but they were quite far apart. The Angolan proposal was sort of open
                    ended as to when the final Cubans would ever leave at all, linked to conditions
                    that the South Africans would giggle over. The South African proposal was a very
                    front-loaded proposal for Cubans all leaving in the first six months, I think it
                    was, or seven months, of the process and the Angolans would laugh at that. We
                    don't know what Castro said about it, but I'm sure he didn't like it.</p>
                <p>But we did have some elements of a framework here, where people understood where
                    we were coming from: a linked package in which South Africa leaves the
                    cross-border war, South Africa gets out of Angola, gets out of Namibia, Namibia
                    becomes independent and the Cubans leave Angola in a parallel package.</p>
                <p>That was on the table. We were determined to hang on to it and to protect it,
                    maybe that's the best word, to protect it from these hostile forces, political
                    forces, in the Congress, in public opinion, the international fora and frankly
                    from within the parties themselves.</p>
                <p>The parties themselves were shooting themselves in the foot by the way they were
                    behaving. So we said, “All right, when you're ready, you have our phone number.
                    We're not pressing for anything. But you know where we are. And in the meantime,
                    we will communicate with you through whatever channels you like.”</p>
                <p>In the case of South Africa, it was British channels. We used British channels to
                    communicate at a very authoritative level with the South African government in
                    the final three months of '86.</p>
                <pb facs="0175" n="Page0175"/>
                <p>We used UN channels and British channels to communicate with the MPLA regime in
                    Angola. When I say “UN channels,” I'm referring to a partner and an ally and a
                    friend who has subsequently distinguished himself as a Nobel Peace Prize-winning
                    diplomat, Martti Ahtisaari, who undertook on behalf of Secretary General Perez
                    de Cuellar a visit or two to Angola on behalf of the SG, Perez de Cuellar, but,
                    in a sense, also on behalf of this peace process, although he wouldn't have put
                    it that way.</p>
                <p>He was definitely fishing for good information, to find out what were they
                    thinking, when will the ice break, when will we be able to warm this up again
                    and under what circumstances and with whom and where and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>Martti is a very skillful person and he could say things to the Angolans that
                    almost no one else probably could have at that time; I wasn't in the room,
                    obviously, but my instinct tells me he spoke along the lines of, “If you think
                    you're going to get better negotiating partners or a better deal than talking
                    and negotiating with Chester Crocker and George Shultz, forget it, because the
                    rest of Washington basically thinks that you people are hopeless pawns of the
                    Soviet Union.” And he would find some diplomatic way to say that and somebody to
                    say it to. It's not quite something that I could say.</p>
                <p>And so I think he helped in several contexts and of course he did it in New York,
                    too, because Ahtisaari was based at the UN in New York at that time.</p>
                <p>So we used indirect channels to try and protect this peace process, but it was
                    pretty quiet, pretty becalmed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have problems with your team, buck up their
                        spirits and all? Were there lots of night sessions of sitting around and

                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: What an assistant secretary can do at a regional bureau is to try and
                    recruit and retain the best people. That's one of his or her most important
                    jobs.</p>
                <p>I wish I could write that in concrete and put it in front of some part of the
                    State Department, because I don't think it's often done that way.</p>
                <p>I had people around me who understood the importance of personnel and we were
                    able to hold onto most of the good people that we had.</p>
                <p>There's always a lot of turnover in the Foreign Service. People go on to new jobs
                    every two-three years.</p>
                <pb facs="0176" n="Page0176"/>
                <p>These were not easy times and I'm sure when I was not in the room that a lot of
                    my career officer colleagues were wondering when I would resign during this time
                    period.</p>
                <p>It was not a good time. At one point in 1986 SFRC chairman Dick Lugar was quoted
                    in the press as saying that he thought that maybe Shultz should think about a
                    new assistant secretary, because of the way the debate was framing on sanctions
                    and so forth.</p>

                        the wall. Congressional rifles were pointed at you. Did you at any point

                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: There was kind of a rallying around, I think is the better way to put
                    it. It might have been different if I had felt I was losing my people, the rats
                    were leaving the ship, but I didn't have that experience.</p>
                <p>On the contrary, I had colleagues, actually one colleague, who came back from the
                    field and agreed to take on a kind of public diplomacy role on behalf of the
                    bureau, a chap named David Miller, who was our ambassador in Zimbabwe,
                    non-career guy. He spent a big chunk of a year trying to help sustain our side
                    in this debate and work with</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Have you? So you know his story. I don't know how much you went into
                    this, but</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: That's an example. There were a lot of long days and a lot of difficult
                    times and some difficult meetings with senior people in the interagency process
                    who would look at you as though you were already pretty damaged goods.
                    “Crocker's on the way out” sort of thing. “We can outlast him.” There was some
                    of that.</p>
                <p>I said to myself when I heard about things like that that there were other
                    people, one doesn't want to get too personal here, but there were other people,
                    like Under Secretary of Defense Richard Armitage who sent me a message during
                    one of the most difficult weeks, I've forgotten which week it was, that said,
                    “Just remember, Chet, they always go for the tallest trees in the forest first.”
                    And I took that to heart. That was very helpful to me, that kind of a
                    message.</p>
                <p>If you look at yourself in the mirror and you feel, “Gee, this is not worth it”
                    maybe you don't continue. But I'm a Scorpio. So maybe it brought out the
                    stubborn streak in me or something.</p>

                        What was happening in Mozambique, up to the death of the president?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: You're absolutely right, we haven't talked enough about it, but it was a
                    parallel peace process and the high point of it had been the Nkomati Accords
                    that was signed in, if memory serves, the spring of 1984, which was kind of a
                    detente agreement between Samora Machel's Mozambique and P.W. Botha's South
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>It was a strange scenario, very strange bedfellows. Here was this former hospital
                    orderly, Samora Machel, who was a kind of a street talker, he talked in your
                    face and he was very charismatic and very spontaneous kind of guy, who always
                    had some off-the-cuff wisecrack. He and Reagan got on like a house afire. Reagan
                    was very moved when Machel died, because he liked Machel.</p>
                <p>He didn't like his policies. He saw him as a Marxist. But Maggie Thatcher had
                    convinced Reagan that Machel was someone that we could deal with.</p>
                <p>Machel came to Washington and had one of the best visits that we had the entire
                    time that I was assistant secretary (and we had a lot of African visits). Reagan
                    got to him by telling jokes, some of them off-color jokes, some of them
                    anti-Soviet jokes and Machel began reciprocating with his own anti-Soviet jokes
                    and they had a good time together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I saw on a television program, we had officers in Moscow
                        who were designated to collect these jokes and pass them on to Ronald
                        Reagan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: No question, and some of the Soviet empire heard about them.</p>
                <p>Despite this, the warming up process between Mozambique and South Africa
                    (1983-84) became victim of the dirty tricks departments within the South African
                    government, specifically the Department of Military Intelligence within the
                    armed forces, which was running the war.</p>
                <p>They really were running the RENAMO war and they were determined, whatever P.W.
                    Botha had agreed with Michel about at Nkomati in '84, by '85 we knew and in '86
                    even more so, that the civil war was hotting up, and that the Mozambicans' backs
                    were against the wall.</p>
                <p>I concluded at the time that P.W. Botha was playing a double game and was telling
                    his foreign affairs department that he was living up to his commitments and
                    telling military intelligence to do what they were doing, which was to torment
                    the Mozambican regime and weaken it to the point that it was like a ripe fruit
                    ready to fall into your hands.</p>
                <pb facs="0178" n="Page0178"/>
                <p>What they intended to do with that fruit if it did fall into their hands one
                    never knew for sure, but Mozambique was a disaster, it was a mess and Machel was
                    a good guy working to try and reach out and broaden his relationships with
                    Britain and the United States and so on, but he didn't have the strategy, or the
                    smarts, maybe, to figure out what to do, given the fact that he was facing a
                    tough-minded South African campaign to destabilize the country and perhaps
                    seduce the US into joining in the effort.</p>
                <p>So when Machel went down in that 1986 plane crash, we'd been doing things for
                    him, we'd been providing some access to assistance and helping open doors for
                    him with the World Bank and the IMF, debt relief, that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>When he went down, we worried that maybe Mozambique itself would go down and
                    would become in a sense nothing but a battleground between a dying
                    Soviet-aligned regime on the one side and a South African-sponsored insurgency
                    on the other side.</p>
                <p>That did not happen. It not happen because the Soviets were disengaging a little
                    bit from providing a blank check to places like Mozambique and because Margaret
                    Thatcher and Ronald Reagan were determined that it not happen.</p>
                <p>The new leader who came in to succeed Samora Michel, Joachim Chissano, did a good
                    job, was very impressive and although a totally different personality from
                    Machel he managed to appeal to the Brits and the Americans and began putting
                    some things right, in terms of Mozambican internal policy, that made a bit of a
                    difference.</p>
                <p>So we didn't lose Mozambique, but we thought, when I said, October 19th of '86,
                    that we might lose Mozambique as a successful front in our effort to rewrite the
                    map of Southern Africa.</p>
                <p>Chissano turned out to be a very remarkable guy. He just stepped down as
                    president a couple of years ago, had a long tenure and quite a successful
                    tenure. A very, very shrewd, thoughtful person, with many skills.</p>
                <p>So people make all the difference. I don't know if all this could have happened
                    if it hadn't been for Margaret Thatcher. Which was interesting, because on some
                    other issues she wasn't necessarily very farsighted.</p>
                <p>But on dealing with Gorbachev and dealing with the Mozambique account and
                    figuring out how to advance a joint cause in Southern Africa generally she could
                    be very helpful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then, after the sanctions vote and the veto, was there
                        sort of a regrouping and then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0179" n="Page0179"/>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, I said that October of '86 was the worst month. Maybe November of
                    '86 was the beginning of the sunshine returning, because that's when Iran-Contra
                    blew up which in a sense was equivalent to the blowing up a counterproductive
                    internecine struggle between NSC, State, Defense and the Agency.</p>
                <p>And it wasn't too long after that that Bill Casey became terminally ill and a
                    whole lot of personalities changed. Frank Carlucci came into the NSC with Colin
                    Powell and then took over DOD.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, with the advent of Carlucci, after all, if
                        nothing else he had given blood, in the Congo, way back and he had been in
                        Portugal already, so he was familiar with the issues. You had somebody who'd
                        sort of been on the ground.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: You had a world-class diplomat in Frank Carlucci, who understood the
                    nuance of how to feed poisoned carrots to Marxists, how to bring them across,
                    how to bring them in from the cold.</p>
                <p>He understood that game. He understood the nuance of it. He'd been there, as you
                    said, in Portugal in '74.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was really, of all our professional diplomats, I think
                        his role in Portugal was really a major, major turning point in sort of the
                        defusing of Eurocommunism.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, certainly in the Iberian peninsula, yes, no question about it and
                    of course he'd won his spurs in the DRC, in the Congo and he knew what it was
                    like to think of that place as a “CIA country.”</p>
                <p>So Frank was a sophisticated operator. He assembled an excellent team of people
                    that included Colin Powell and Bob Oakley and Hank Cohen and others, who became
                    part of a more literate, a more sophisticated, a more deft apparatus that also
                    put discipline in the system, ultimately, so that there were proper
                    consultations at the interagency level and not just endless a turf war and arm
                    wrestling. That made a difference.</p>
                <p>So I think there were a number of factors that came right. By the early months of
                    '87 the sun was starting to shine again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is May 13, 2009. Once the Iran-Contra affair came
                        out, it had an effect of in a way limiting the CIA from its activities. I
                        assume that this meant sort of a diminished role, as far as its ties to
                        white South African intelligence and so on.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, picking up on that, there were a number of key personnel changes.
                    American foreign policy is often a function of appointments and key people. So
                    between November of '86 and let's say May of '87 the following things took
                    place: we saw the resignation of Casper Weinberger, we saw yet another national
                    security advisor team bite the dust over Ollie North and Iran-Contra, we saw the
                    appointment of Frank Carlucci and Colin Powell as the new NSC team and at a
                    certain point in that chronology Powell takes over the NSC and Carlucci goes to
                    Defense, we saw the demise of Bill Casey.</p>
                <p>All of these things served to give the final 18 months plus of the Reagan
                    Administration a degree of strategic coherence, discipline and good order that
                    it had lacked for a previous six and a half years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes historically one gets involved in these things
                        and you can't see where you were until we're sitting back in your office in
                        Georgetown and looking at it. But did you have this feeling that, gee, this
                        isn't a very coherent group before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Oh, my heavens, yes and we've talked about this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know we have, but at the time, how about the president,
                        was he just sort of considered so far aloof and above this, or</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: At the time we were very much aware of the fact that we had had a
                    succession of national security advisors who had not added up to all that one
                    might want, in terms of establishing discipline in the system and making for a
                    coherent decision making process so there might be disciplined interactions
                    between the president and his principal lieutenants, rather than constant end
                    runs.</p>
                <p>My boss has written his own memoir and he can speak for himself, but he used to
                    remark that, “We have decisions in Washington, but nothing ever gets decided in
                    Washington, because you get a decision, you leave the room and somebody comes in
                    and undecides what was just decided.”</p>
                <p>And so you can be certain that he had a whole lot more to feel frustrated about
                    than I did, because it related to US policy on virtually everything: Southeast
                    Asia, Central America, Southern Africa, relations with Moscow, arms control and
                    so forth.</p>
                <pb facs="0181" n="Page0181"/>
                <p>The first four NSC advisors I think for Reagan did not establish that kind of
                    coherence. But it did, as a result of the Tower Commission on Iran-Contra and
                    the new appointments of Howard Baker, I didn't mention that name earlier, but
                    Howard Baker made a huge difference and Carlucci and Powell, you saw a very
                    different constellation of big players which made it possible for those of us
                    who were trying to do the nation's business to actually have a sense we had
                    solid ground under our feet and not just a constantly shifting kaleidoscope of
                    backstabbing and end runs and games and subversion.</p>
                <p>That was my view at the time: that I was being subverted very regularly and had
                    to keep on fighting battles to keep control of policy coherence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say you were being subverted, was this especially
                        the CIA, or other elements, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, parts of the CIA were very, very helpful and very important
                    colleagues and partners in what we were doing, because they were analysts who
                    were calling it straight. But there were the rogue elements who basically
                    disagreed with our policy and sought to sideline it or marginalize it and saw
                    the beginning of support for Savimbi as somehow the thin edge of a wedge for
                    making our entire Angola-Namibia policy military, rather than diplomatic and
                    opening up another military front in Mozambique and possibly Ethiopia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, for people looking at this from outside, at the
                        time at least there were certainly attempts to tar you with the brush of
                        being a Reagan creature of the right and all that and here you are, the
                        people who were basically trying to subvert you weren't sort of the
                        wishy-washy liberals, it was the hardline right, would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, it was both, at certain points and '86 was the toughest year
                    politically from that standpoint but it began to turn positive in '87, for some
                    of the reasons that I've indicated.</p>
                <p>The subversion came from a combination of appointees inside the administration, a
                    couple at Defense, a couple in the White House. Pat Buchanan I've mentioned
                    before. People in DIA, some people in the Agency, and also folks on Capitol
                    Hill, congressional staffs and disaffected Senate offices, let's put it that way
                    and then some of the political activists and that right wing media.</p>
                <pb facs="0182" n="Page0182"/>
                <p>And we would regularly read critical stuff about how State was doing x, y and z,
                    that was giving away the candy store to Marxists. So we were being attacked from
                    the right. I've got a cartoon framed at home that has a picture of Chet Crocker
                    selling off African states to Marxist slavery and they're being auctioned off
                    like at a slave auction: Namibia and Angola and South Africa and Mozambique and
                    all these slaves with names on them and there's Crocker with the whip, doing the
                    auction. This was the Washington Times view of our African policy. But there was
                    also subversion from the more slick and sophisticated liberal and left side that
                    would have loved to see a change away from the sort of coherent strategy we were
                    trying to conduct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where we they coming from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: What they wanted was much more ardent support for the sanctions, which
                    of course were imposed over the president's veto in October of '86. They always
                    sensed that we weren't fully with that program and of course they were right. We
                    applied the law, we obeyed the law, the sanctions law, but we did not change
                    constructive engagement, we did not stop talking about it, we did not stop doing
                    it.</p>
                <p>They were much more focused on the agenda within South Africa. They were also
                    inclined to think that our negotiation on Namibia and Angola was a fool's errand
                    that would not succeed. They were at times even disappointed when there was
                    evidence that it was succeeding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This happens. Were you getting any signs of disapproval
                        from your colleagues in the academic world, particularly at Georgetown, but
                        elsewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Oh, well, sure. And that would be of course from the more liberal side.
                    I made it a point for a number of years to go to the African Studies Association
                    annual meetings and stand up and give my remarks and take the abuse from these
                    regional specialists, most of whom were somewhere off in the left field
                    bleachers when it came to foreign policy, very disaffected, very skeptical, very
                    inclined to buy into whatever line the East German and Soviet legal departments
                    were cranking out in terms of their UN speeches, especially when it came to the
                    “legalities” of constructive engagement.</p>
                <p>The Russians and the East Germans used to love to debate fine points of law when
                    it came to our negotiations and of course academics picked up on that.</p>
                <pb facs="0183" n="Page0183"/>
                <p>But this set of administration personnel changes created a changed environment
                    and I think also the intervention of the British, to some extent the West
                    Germans and the United Nations, in the form of Perez de Cuellar and Martti
                    Ahtisaari, it made a big difference in keeping South Africans more sober about
                    the importance of this regional negotiating framework and also advising the MPLA
                    and Angolans that they needed to not walk away from this negotiation, because it
                    might actually produce something.</p>
                <p>The first evidence of that was the reestablishment of direct talks, after quite a
                    long hiatus, it must have been a six month hiatus, perhaps, maybe eight, until
                    April of '87, when we had our next major meeting with the Angolans. We met them
                    in Brazzaville in what is the Republic of Congo and we met them for a day or two
                    of meetings, sponsored by President Sassou Nguesso of the Congo.</p>
                <p>That's significant only in that that location is a friendly location to the MPLA,
                    so the gesture, this is the way sometimes Marxists negotiated, the gesture of
                    the American delegation being willing to go to Brazzaville to meet with them,
                    first of all it's next door; secondly, it's the place where they used to have
                    their headquarters in exile; thirdly, it was a quasi-Marxist government, of an
                    Yves Saint Laurent variety.</p>
                <p>So that was a gesture which made it possible for the MPLA to come and meet with
                    us and we had a renewal of direct talks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have relations with Brazzaville at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: We did have relations and they were steadily improving at this point and
                    in fact a lot of the final end game of negotiations took place in Brazzaville,
                    meeting after meeting after meeting took place in Brazzaville after that, but
                    April of '87 was the beginning of that phase, if you like.</p>
                <p>And we made clear to the Angolans that in a sense they really had some decisions
                    to take. The South Africans had partially accepted (very partially) a 1985
                    proposal. The ball was still in the Angolan court, that kind of a
                    conversation.</p>
                <p>I wouldn't say we made a lot of progress. We reopened direct talks, is the basic
                    point. So one could no longer say and at my nadir what people were saying was
                    the State Department's process has collapsed. They could no longer say that, as
                    the process was back in motion, we were having substantive meetings with the
                    parties and we were also briefing third parties and the South African side about
                    what was taking place. So there was a beginning of reenergizing of the
                    process.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0184" n="Page0184"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you're having talks of this nature, did you, sort of
                        after a session get together with your fellows who were doing this and say,
                        what does this all mean? In other words, talk is talk. How do you handle
                        this sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, there always is going to be that kind of a post mortem, then
                    somebody is the lead drafting officer, who tries to recapture what it meant,
                    both in terms of what it really meant and also in terms of what you're going to
                    report that it meant, because those are two different decisions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain this process? I know what you mean, but
                        I think you should explain it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, a lot depends on the channels that you're using for reporting and
                    we would have multiple audiences, but my most important channel of course was
                    directly to the Secretary and that would be a restricted channel, NO DIS cable
                    and so on, as we called it. NO DIS meant lots of distribution, in fact, at very
                    high levels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to say I interviewed Ann Swift, who ended up as an
                        Iranian hostage and she said that as a very junior officer she was waiting
                        her assignment with a bunch of other brand new officers and they'd sit
                        around at lunchtime and read the NO DIS cables. They had no idea what they
                        really meant.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: So there's a lesson in all this. If you really want only one person to
                    read your stuff, you might beat the leaks and unauthorized viewing by sending it
                    “Limited Official Use,” the lowest category.</p>
                <p>So we would report to the boss and it would get circulated to all the Seventh
                    Floor and probably the White House and perhaps beyond. Kind of an official
                    report but also it would be a report that aimed at giving folks the big
                    picture.</p>
                <p>We would also report more operational messages laterally to our posts in Africa
                    and to our listening posts in London, Paris and elsewhere, Moscow, where it was
                    important for people to be aware of what was going on, so they could sustain
                    conversations with counterparts on a regular basis, to give them ammunition for
                    conducting those conversations, in effect.</p>
                <p>So what we'd be doing quite often is creating cable traffic laterally that
                    contained the appropriate combination of fact, interpretation and spin, so that
                    we could arm our troops. This is a war we're talking about.</p>
                <pb facs="0185" n="Page0185"/>
                <p>I came to the conviction that diplomacy and making peace have a relationship to
                    conflict and war. What you were doing is trying to fight and win vis-�-vis the
                    parties that are on the other side of the table from you. They're not your
                    enemies, but they have their own interests and you have your interests.</p>
                <p>So inevitably what you're trying to do when writing and informing people is to
                    get across your side of the story. And it's got to be credible. It's got to be
                    factually based. But it's also got to support the cause. If you don't believe in
                    your cause, who the hell will believe in your cause? That was the way I
                    approached this.</p>
                <p>And so in reporting to everybody, including the Secretary of State, I would try
                    to find whatever ammunition there was to support a constructive interpretation
                    of the process - accurate but balanced — even if, in my heart of hearts, I was
                    disappointed after a meeting, or not persuaded that we made much headway.</p>
                <p>But we would have an internal round robin after a major meeting to review what it
                    meant and what were the interesting things that were said, if anything. What was
                    the significance that one person had done the speaking for the other side and
                    not another, that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the British in this, or was this strictly
                        Americans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, they wouldn't be in the room, but we were in touch with them every
                    step of the way and they would be amongst the most avid readers of what we were
                    writing and we would give them a particular brief, not least because they were
                    our channel to the MPLA in Luanda and so their people in Angola needed to know
                    and did know, thanks to what we did, did know very regularly, I would report
                    laterally to my counterpart in the FCO in London.</p>
                <p>That person would immediately flash it down to Luanda, so that our friends in the
                    British establishment there would be aware of what was going on.</p>
                <p>I don't mean to imply that I was reporting stuff directly to British posts in the
                    field. We were using our channels to London and assuming that they would forward
                    stuff on, which indeed they did.</p>
                <p>This was a real partnership and an invaluable one, in many respects and they gave
                    us advice and feedback and they could help us interpret things that we didn't
                    understand.</p>
                <p>So, again, this was April of 1987. We had another meeting with the Angolans in
                    July of that year, which was led by a rather unimpressive senior official on the
                    Angolan side and I was frankly fed up with that exchange; and, at the end of it
                    we put out press guidance which actually was rather interesting and said that
                    the talks had been a waste of time.</p>
                <pb facs="0186" n="Page0186"/>
                <p>Since we didn't say that all the time, the fact that we said it got the attention
                    of everybody. Our phones were ringing off the hook. “What do they mean? What is
                    State saying? This is their process. They're saying the talks are a waste of
                    time?”</p>
                <p>And within 24 hours the Angolans put out a statement saying, “No they weren't.
                    They were very useful and productive and constructive talks.” So what that began
                    to show is that the Angolans were under some pressure to keep this process on
                    the tracks and to support the impression that progress was happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Newborn Marxists often learn that communist cant and all
                        but really, one, didn't understand it and, two, didn't use it well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: There's something to that. And we would try to cut through it, of
                    course, because it was so obviously an acquired garment that they were
                    wearing.</p>
                <p>But by July of '87, we now know, we didn't know at the time, but we now know
                    there were important things taking place, there were plans for another major
                    FAPLA dry season offensive against UNITA within Angola.</p>
                <p>We knew that there were conversations taking place with the Cubans and in fact
                    the Angolans said to us that they could imagine dealing with a partial Cuban
                    withdrawal calendar, but the way they would frame it was that troops would
                    redeploy out of the south of Angola to the north, within Angola.</p>
                <p>Well, Angola's a big place and the terminology was so vague and the notion of
                    withdrawal was so unspecific that to grasp Angolan thinking was like trying to
                    nail jello to a tree, you're thinking of this redeployment of X,000, or whatever
                    number of Cubans it was to some unspecified place also in Angola, when we were
                    trying to get them out of the country.</p>
                <p>They said, “Well, we'll redeploy them to the north, progressively, as conditions
                    improve during the implementation of the Namibia plan.” In a sense, what I'm
                    telling you is that they were half pregnant. They were accepting the notion of
                    Cuban withdrawal, but they wanted it all their way.</p>
                <p>And we said, “Look, let's get serious here. We need a plan that has finality to
                    it, has dates, has benchmarks, milestones and so forth. Why? Because the South
                    Africans have finality on their commitments on Resolution 435 and they're not
                    going to buy what you're trying to sell me. They're just not going to buy it.”
                    So that's when the waste of time phrase was used.</p>
                <pb facs="0187" n="Page0187"/>
                <p>And the next thing that happened in this process that I shall share with you that
                    was really very interesting was an unofficial intervention of sorts . I was
                    sitting in my office, it was early August of '87, when the Deputy Secretary of
                    State, John Whitehead, a man for whom I have enormous regard, called me and
                    said, “Chet, I've just met with the daughter of David Rockefeller and she has
                    something to say that you might find interesting. Do you want to come up and
                    hear it?”</p>
                <p>So I went up and there was John sitting down with Peggy Dulany. I've not said
                    this on the record before, so it's not in my memoir. Peggy is an interesting
                    person. She runs her own foundation. She supports a lot of very progressive
                    causes around the world and serves on a number of foundation boards and so
                    on.</p>
                <p>She had just spent a week or ten days, whatever it was, in Cuba and what she was
                    telling us was that Castro was interested in joining our talks and that he was
                    in effect using a Rockefeller channel to send a message to the United States
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Only in America!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: One might say a left wing Rockefeller channel to send a message to
                    America. Well, this could be a trap, it could be a snake pit, it could be any
                    number of things, but it looked like it might a bid that was worth testing.</p>
                <p>So we debated it internally, we talked about it, we wrote analyses of it and went
                    back upstairs to the Seventh Floor and said, essentially, “We gotta test this,
                    because for all these years we've been doing this without having the benefit of
                    a direct channel to Havana and we have to test it, but we have to test it in a
                    way that gives us something in return, if we're going to consider doing it.”</p>
                <p>We spent the next four or five months figuring out how best to test the apparent
                    Cuban bid and to define what would we expect if the Cubans joined the talks,
                    what would be the quid pro quo for giving them that standing. And of course it
                    wasn't for us to do it, to give them that standing, it was the Angolans who
                    would be giving them that standing. So we went immediately to the Angolans,
                    after we had made our decision and said, “Look, friends, the Cubans seem to
                    think that they should be part of that process. Is that what you want? Are you a
                    sovereign government, or do you feel the need to have your fraternal Marxist
                    allies at your side during these negotiations? Would you be more comfortable
                    with them in the room?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way it does sound like you're saying, “Do you really
                        want to give up a certain amount of your sovereignty?” Sort of a challenge
                        to them, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0188" n="Page0188"/>
                <p>CROCKER: It was. It was intended to complicate their minds, but also to get them
                    to make a decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we want the Cubans in, at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: We wanted to find out if getting the Cubans in would bring something. So
                    what we said to the Angolans was, “First of all, do you want them? Do you think
                    it will reflect well on your sovereignty and your control of your own affairs?
                    If you want them in, we have to be assured that it will produce something.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No more waste of time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: So we had three or four rounds with different elements of the Angolan
                    leadership at quite senior levels, asking this question - “How do we know that
                    this will produce something more than a photo opportunity for Fidel Castro? In
                    U.S.-Cuban terms, Ronald Reagan and George Shultz and Chet Crocker cannot afford
                    an engagement with Cuba that does nothing except give Cuba a photo opportunity.
                    We're not prepared to do that. We've got to be assured that something is going
                    to result from this.”</p>
                <p>So then the Angolans said, “What do you need?”</p>
                <p>“What we need is a commitment in principle to total Cuban troop withdrawal within
                    a defined time frame, in conjunction with South African commitments on Namibia.”
                    And then we got back a lot of throat clearing and a lot of preambular stuff
                    about, “We need a gesture from the American side, if we're to get something from
                    the Cuban side, like you agree on cutting off aid to Savimbi.”</p>
                <p>So, again, for those four, five months we had a back and forth with them about
                    what would the Cubans be prepared to do and what would an American gesture be?
                    Are we prepared to even consider the card of suspending or cutting off aid to
                    UNITA? Well, I had no interest in that idea, not least because it would have
                    been the end of my career in the Department of State had I said anything
                    positive about that proposition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a military action going on during this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Oh, yes, big time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And was that changing the field?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0189" n="Page0189"/>
                <p>CROCKER: It was and I will get to that in just one second, but I just want to
                    make the point that what we were demanding is something from them and what they
                    were demanding is something from us, in order to get to the point that we might
                    actually have the Cubans join the process.</p>
                <p>We understood that for the past years we had been negotiating with the MPLA
                    regime but that they have been keeping their Cuban allies very fully briefed and
                    that in fact the rooms we met in often probably bugged by Cuban intelligence. We
                    kind of assumed that. But it's very different to have them in the room, to meet
                    them face to face, for one thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure, sure. They have to participate, which means
                        something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Absolutely. They've got to come up with some words. They've got to
                    indicate their view of the process. They've got to say something about what the
                    goal is and what their priorities are and so forth. So it was a very important
                    set of internal discussions.</p>
                <p>Our real answer to the MPLA demand that we suspend or cut off UNITA was simply
                    this: the facts on the ground during the implementation of a Cuban withdrawal
                    schedule and a South African withdrawal schedule will transform the strategic
                    environment in your country.</p>
                <p>So don't ask us, at this stage, to say things about what we are going to have as
                    our relationship to UNITA. UNITA is going to lose its South African connection
                    when South Africa leaves Namibia. By definition, they're going to lose it. Just
                    look at the map. They're going to lose it, just as you're going to lose your
                    Cuban connection under the withdrawal schedule that we come up with
                    eventually.</p>
                <p>So we're talking about letting Angola be Angola. This is going to create
                    conditions in which you'll have to decide at what stage you negotiate with UNITA
                    and what the deal is.</p>
                <p>So we did not accept that demand. We rejected the demand, but we put it in a
                    different context. We said events on the ground will produce a UNITA that has
                    less external support, just as it will produce an MPLA which had less external
                    support.</p>
                <p>I want to come back, now, to your question. While we were having these
                    discussions in the fall of 1987 the Soviet command structure was organizing a
                    final and in some ways least successful dry season offensive in a long history
                    of dry season offensives against South Africa and U.S.-backed UNITA in southern
                    Angola. It produced a fiasco for the FAPLA forces, the MPLA forces. They lost
                    several brigades worth of armor and other units and it created such a reverse
                    that the South African special forces and UNITA captured just tons and tons of
                    Soviet equipment, enough to keep them going for quite some time.</p>
                <pb facs="0190" n="Page0190"/>
                <p>And there was a lot of crowing by certain elements of the South African structure
                    which was stupid and unhelpful. At one stage the South African defense minister
                    took a helicopter ride into Jamba, which was UNITA's headquarters and gave press
                    statements about how this was the beginning of the end of the Soviet empire and
                    so forth, just exactly the wrong thing to do at a time like that, in our own
                    view, but they were trying to rub MPLA noses in their defeat and they pushed
                    pretty hard.</p>
                <p>This led to a series of follow up operations, which are still debated today
                    amongst military historians, as to what really happened, but between October of
                    '87 and January of '88 there were a series of South African operations, there've
                    been books written about them, which culminated in a standoff at a town called
                    Cuito Cuanavale in southern Angola, which to this day the Angolans claim was a
                    great Angolan victory over South Africa, which the Cubans claim was the
                    beginning of the end of apartheid and they've written their own books about it
                    and Castro gave speeches about it. Cuito Cuanavale is the subject of socialist
                    anniversaries and so on in Cuban circles. The South Africans basically, in their
                    follow up operations, pushed up towards this town, engaged in weeks of
                    protracted artillery engagements with Cuban and FAPLA units but decided not to
                    take it. They deliberated and recognized the downsides of seizing, holding and
                    having to defend a major town.</p>
                <p>But the point I'm really getting at was that the Soviet-fueled offensive was
                    unsuccessful and it was in that context that Fidel Castro went to Moscow in
                    November of '87 for the sixtieth anniversary of the Soviet revolution. While
                    there he had conversations, we heard this from Cubans once we got talking to
                    them, we didn't know it at the time, but the Cubans were saying to the Soviets,
                    “You don't know how to fight a counterinsurgency war. We Cubans know a lot more
                    about this. We know Angola and Angolans. We will raise the ante, put more troops
                    in, but we insist on taking over the direction of this war.”</p>
                <p>And of course the Angolans were in these meetings, too, they were trilateral
                    meetings, in which basically the Cubans said, “This is so important, to Angola
                    and to all of us, that we are prepared to raise the ante, put in more troops,
                    but we want a bigger seat at the table, both in the war and the peace.”</p>
                <p>So while they were bidding for a role in our peace process, they were bidding in
                    Moscow for a role in the war process. In hindsight, November 1987 was a very
                    important watershed,</p>
                <p>We didn't know all that at the time, but we began to see by December '87 growing
                    numbers of Cuban troops arriving in Angola and we were also planning our first
                    meeting in which the Cubans would join the talks. So that kind of changed my
                    talking points when I got to Luanda for the first US-Angola-Cuba trilateral in
                    January of 1988.</p>
                <pb facs="0191" n="Page0191"/>
                <p>We were welcomed by our Angolan hosts at the presidential compound in Luanda. Dos
                    Santos is right there, the president and his top team introduced us to the
                    Cubans, who were all smoking big cigars, big smiles. And they sat down at the
                    table and we first asked, “Are you one delegation, or two delegations?”</p>
                <p>And they said, “We'll be one delegations, with two leaders, a joint
                    delegation.”</p>
                <p>That's fine, weren't going to argue with that, but we had to obviously ask them
                    several questions like, “What is your view of a total Cuban withdrawal
                    commitment, in the context of a South African departure and complete cutting of
                    links in the south?”</p>
                <p>And we also had to ask them, “What are you doing, bringing more forces in?”</p>
                <p>So the beginning of that conversation was pretty direct, but it produced what we
                    needed. It produced a degree of coherence and direct statements, that would
                    enable us to say that it was worth bringing them to the table, that they were
                    prepared in principle to talk about a schedule of total withdrawal. They weren't
                    giving us dates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting the feeling that they were tired of this
                        thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: We learned that later. We didn't have the feeling then, necessarily.
                    There is always a risk of too much hindsight, it's really hard to say.</p>
                <p>I'll make two points here. The first point is that dealing with the Angolans, for
                    all these years, we understood that they were in somewhat of a bind, they were
                    in a tough position. They were negotiating not only their own fate but also the
                    equities of their socialist brothers behind their backs. The Cubans and Soviets
                    were not in the room. We were in the room, the other superpower.</p>
                <p>Secondly, they were a weak and still at that point somewhat a divided government
                    facing a regional hegemon named South Africa, which was attacking them, both
                    directly or indirectly.</p>
                <p>And thirdly they didn't really know quite how to negotiate in an asymmetric
                    situation with the United States of America. So having a capable negotiating
                    partner with a degree of coherence and decisiveness was a good thing and we
                    sensed that it might be an asset, although we didn't know in January of '88 that
                    it would produce success. We had no way of knowing that.</p>
                <p>We were a little frustrated, let's put it that way, with the indecisiveness of
                    our Angolan interactions and having the Cubans say something, even though very
                    general and very caveated, about the principle of total Cuban troop withdrawal
                    was meaningful.</p>
                <pb facs="0192" n="Page0192"/>
                <p>We didn't get a paper, we didn't have a schedule, and we didn't have a withdrawal
                    plan. What we had was an oral acceptance of a principle and I can't emphasize
                    strongly enough how “principled” sometimes these negotiations can be.</p>
                <p>When people talk about their principles, they're talking about things that are
                    political requirements for them, almost their sacred tenets and for them to
                    accept the principle of leaving Angola with all combat forces out of Angola,
                    even if it's an undefined number of years, was an important advance for us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in hindsight it's easy to think of this, but at the
                        time, were you getting any feeling for this sort of overarching thing, the
                        beginning of the collapse of the Soviet empire? This is Gorbachev with his
                        perestroika and glasnost and beginning to make the decision, “We can't keep
                        up with the West and we have to cut our commitments.” But was that at all
                        apparent and were the Cubans understanding this? Or do you think it was a
                        factor at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: It's an extremely important question and we'll get into it for the bulk
                    of the 1988 events. We had eleven meetings over twelve months, so it was very
                    intense and the Soviets were part of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the beginning of this, you didn't</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: For one thing, we didn't know that Castro had basically told the Russian
                    high command that he was prepared to raise the ante militarily, but he wanted to
                    run the war. We didn't know that. We know it now, we didn't know it then.</p>
                <p>No, I think what we sensed was that the regional conflicts were a topic Moscow
                    wished to discuss and so did we, and we were having discussions at the
                    U.S.-Soviet level about regional conflicts. But the conflict that was the real
                    thorn for Gorbachev was Afghanistan, not Angola. There were not that many
                    Russians exposed. There were Russian credits exposed, a lot of hardware exposed,
                    a lot of political capital and so forth, but it was Cubans who were really
                    exposed on the ground, and of course the Angolans.</p>
                <p>So it was quite unlike Afghanistan in that sense. In January of '88, we didn't
                    sense that Soviet 'new thinking' was changing the calculations of Cubans and
                    Angolans. Gorbachev's calculations may have been changing, but that's a
                    different point.</p>
                <p>One needs to look back very carefully at a series of speeches that Gorbachev gave
                    when he referred to Afghanistan as a “bleeding wound.” A lot of people began to
                    say, “Okay, we understand that, where this is going.” And I believe that he gave
                    a speech in '87 when he made that reference to Afghanistan.</p>
                <pb facs="0193" n="Page0193"/>
                <p>Anyway, so we had crossed this threshold of having accepted the idea of a joint
                    Angolan-Cuban delegation and it produced agreements to meet again shortly and we
                    met again shortly in Geneva - I don't have all the dates and places
                    memorized.</p>
                <p>But it was January of '88 when Cuba joins the talks and categorically accepts the
                    principle of total Cuban troop withdrawal. In March of '88 we met with the
                    Cubans and Angolans jointly and then immediately afterwards with the South
                    Africans in Geneva, so we had back to back sessions.</p>
                <p>The South Africans had begun to pick up signals that there was something going on
                    (and remember they had been estranged ever since the sanctions vote and so
                    forth), but they were clearly beginning to pick up signals of (a) we were doing
                    something pretty intense with the Angolans, (b) that the Cubans had joined the
                    process, (c) that there were more Cubans coming into Angola and what's the hell
                    is that all about, Crocker, is this the result of your diplomacy, more Cubans
                    having arrived and how do we read Gorbachev, anyway and what do you think about
                    Mikhail Gorbachev and Shevardnadze and so forth? Are they really running things,
                    or is this the military and so forth. So we had lots of South African
                    questions.</p>
                <p>I have to come back again to the role of our allies. Margaret Thatcher was the
                    interpreter of Mikhail Gorbachev to her principal Western allies, Ronald Reagan
                    and Helmut Kohl. She was never all that close with Helmut Kohl, but they talked
                    a lot about what is Gorbachev all about, what is perestroika, what is glasnost,
                    where is all this heading?</p>
                <p>The British intelligence apparatus and the Foreign Office and other elements of
                    the British structure played a critical role in advising Thatcher how she should
                    advise her allies and they listened to her.</p>
                <p>She also spoke with Franz Josef Strauss who was the Bavarian premier and a
                    linchpin of the CDU-CSU alliance that ran the German government of the day, a
                    very important player in interpreting Gorbachev; he had been to Moscow, had his
                    own direct discussions with the Soviets in late '87, early '88.</p>
                <p>And I am certain that at several points Franz Josef Strauss was telling the South
                    Africans, who he was very close to, what he thought about Gorbachev, which gets
                    back to your question. And of course the Brits were telling the South Africans
                    what they thought about Gorbachev.</p>
                <p>So when the South Africans came and asked us what we thought about Gorbachev,
                    they were triangulating, that is finding out what are all these different
                    characters think and what does it add up to?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0194" n="Page0194"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any feel for what the Cubans thought
                        about what was happening? Did we have any good intelligence or at least
                        interpretation of the Cubans' state of mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: The Cubans are so much propaganda that it's really hard to get a candid
                    view of what the Cubans thought. I don't think the Cubans recognized the full
                    extent of what Gorbachev was doing until much later, and they had no idea that
                    he could completely lose control of the domestic reform process, so that by the
                    end of '89 the Wall would come down. I don't think they could see all that
                    coming. They didn't see their own abandonment by the Russians, which is what
                    happened in the early Nineties, with devastating effects for their economy.</p>
                <p>But I think they had limited respect for Soviet officials. They saw them as
                    drunk, culturally inept, sometimes racists, unfamiliar with the African
                    environment, not having a clue what to do in the vastnesses of rural Angola.
                    Angola's bigger than Western Europe, for God's sake. You don't seize hills and
                    think that you're going to win a counterinsurgency war by seizing hills.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And wait for winter! The Cubans were right about
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Absolutely right and they rubbed it in a bit. I think the Soviets found
                    this a little difficult, because their Cuban “younger brothers” were running
                    circles around them in terms of battlefield savvy.</p>
                <p>The Cubans reinforced Cuito Cuanavale. They brought in additional air power and
                    armor and they stiffened the Angolan positions in Cuito Cuanavale such that it
                    was a harder target for the big South African artillery and air power..</p>
                <p>So eventually the South Africans said, “We don't want to take Cuito Cuanavale. We
                    never did want to take Cuito Cuanavale. What we wanted to do was to pin the
                    other guys down and bleed them. But if bleeding them becomes a situation where
                    we get bled, too, we don't need that.</p>
                <p>South Africa's big artillery (G5s and G6s) were the best long range artillery in
                    the world, but they didn't have the best air power or the air defenses, so there
                    was an asymmetry. The South Africans were good on the ground with their
                    artillery, the Cubans and Angolans had a lot of armor and they had more and more
                    modern aircraft than the South Africans had.</p>
                <p>The South Africans said to themselves, “We don't need to get bloodied over this.
                    It's really not worth it. We proved our point and have no long term interest in
                    holding an Angolan town that becomes a target. We beat them last dry season. So
                    we'll gradually thin out our forces” and they did pull back, they pulled back
                    from Cuito, which was why the Angolans and Cubans, until the end of the
                    communist era, are going to claim that Cuito Cuanavale was a Cuban victory.</p>
                <pb facs="0195" n="Page0195"/>
                <p>It was actually a stalemate. But the Cubans had reinforced and when you reinforce
                    and the other guys pull back it looks like you won. So you can read different
                    accounts of this battle, but by end of January of '88 the Cubans had put
                    additional forces there.</p>
                <p>Now this is in the southeastern part of Angola. But the more important thing they
                    were doing is putting more forces in the southwestern part of Angola. So by the
                    time we got to March, April of 1988, the Cubans had doubled their forces
                    deployed in Angola. They put in an extra 25,000 troops, plus air cover and their
                    best generals and so forth. This was becoming a pretty big deal.</p>
                <p>At one point I went upstairs to talk to my boss, Secretary Shultz, we were
                    heading to another round of discussion, it was probably May of '88 and he said,
                    “Chet, interpret this intelligence to me. The Cubans, who said they're going to
                    join the talks to make peace, have now doubled their forces. They have 50,000
                    troops in Angola. Aren't the South Africans going to go after them and really
                    bleed them now and take them out, and what does this tell us about Cuban
                    intentions?”</p>
                <p>Well, it was a very interesting challenge of interpretation, but what I said at
                    the time was, “If the South Africans go after the Cubans they're going to get
                    hurt, but if the Cubans go after the South Africans they'll get hurt.” Each side
                    had built up to the point that they could hurt each other on their turf, but
                    they couldn't go after the other guy's turf, but it was that kind of a
                    standoff.</p>
                <p>Castro didn't double his forces in order to invade and occupy Namibia. That
                    wasn't his purpose. We now know what his purpose was, but I'm jumping ahead of
                    the story. We shouldn't do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, go at your own pace.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I've described a little bit the Geneva talks in March of '88, which were
                    with two delegations, but separately, that is to say the joint Angolan-Cuban
                    delegation, followed by the South African delegation.</p>
                <p>And what this was all about was, are we at the stage now where we could look at
                    direct talks? Remember, I've been doing this peace process since January of '81.
                    We have never had direct talks, apart from the Lusaka talks of March of '84,
                    which were for a brief period. We have never gotten the Angolans and South
                    Africans and certainly not the Cubans all in one room for a structured plenary
                    session.</p>
                <p>So the weeks between mid-March and early May of '88 we were debating and
                    discussing with the parties, “Are we ready yet? Where should we do it? Who would
                    come? How many people would come? What level of delegations and what's the
                    agenda?”</p>
                <pb facs="0196" n="Page0196"/>
                <p>And we talked to everybody we could think of as to where's the right venue. This
                    sounds like minor stuff. In planning mediation and negotiation, venue is very
                    important. We discussed many options. Washington, though, we can't have the
                    Cubans in Washington. Probably not the South Africans, either. Where should we
                    do this?</p>
                <p>We floated a number of ideas, but what came to us eventually was “What about the
                    British?” The British are connected to this process, they're very important to
                    this process. South Africans are very comfortable in Britain, they know Britain
                    well. Angolans were not uncomfortable with that idea.</p>
                <p>The Cubans were very excited. Cubans don't often get to London. But Cubans also
                    are very special travelers. When they come, they come with video cameras and
                    with security, they all pack iron. It was interesting, the Brits had a heck of a
                    job figuring out what to do with Cuban security.</p>
                <p>But, anyway, we agreed on London and we also agreed to welcome the presence of a
                    senior Russian observer, not at the table, but we asked the Russians if they
                    would like to send a senior person and they did send a senior person to meet
                    with us on the side, not in the room, but on the side, so that they would not be
                    seen to be excluded from this, and could follow developments by proximity.</p>
                <p>That senior person was not the one I had negotiated with and talked to for many,
                    many years, Vladilen Vasev by name, who was a fine diplomat. It was the deputy
                    foreign minister, Anatoly Adamishin, who came to London. And actually I met him
                    before we started the first round of the trilateral talks. We had a good
                    discussion.</p>
                <p>We got to know each other and it became a habit, from then on, until the end of
                    the process, that we would invite, or encourage, because it was not for us to
                    invite, we would encourage a senior Russian to come and be present in the city
                    chosen as the venue, but not formally part of the process. They didn't want to
                    be formally part of the process. We weren't saying “You could co-chair it.” They
                    were 'observers'. That enabled them to distance themselves from whatever went
                    wrong while keeping a close eye on the talks by talking with us and with their
                    socialist allies.</p>
                <p>So we would see them in their hotel or in our hotel or in some other place, the
                    Soviet mission and we talked about all of this.</p>
                <p>That's a separate chapter that we should go into, the U.S.-Russian discussion
                    about this. It was a very important discussion, but I want to underscore the
                    point that the Russians were not negotiating with us the outcome of Cuba-Angola.
                    They were not negotiating with us. They were feeling us out, so they would know
                    where our state of mind was and we were feeling them out, for exactly the same
                    reason: we might say “Couldn't you encourage your friends to do this?”</p>
                <pb facs="0197" n="Page0197"/>
                <p>So a lot of things changed in '88</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is September 24, 2009. Chet please continue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: The Soviet role is an interesting chapter in this story. And there's
                    also a chapter or two on the role of everybody else.</p>
                <p>Maybe one starting place is to emphasize that as I think we talked about, 1987
                    was a decisive year in relations between the communist allies: Cuba, Angola and
                    the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>And the offensives of the fall of '87, which were very, very unsuccessful, led to
                    a change of strategy and a change of leadership, really, in both the war and the
                    diplomacy and introduced a situation in which the Cubans became a formal
                    negotiating partner at the table, joining the Angolan team, forming a joint
                    delegation and at the same time the Cubans asserted military leadership on the
                    battlefield; and it was really they who first of all raised the ante by
                    increasing their number of troops up to about 50,000.</p>
                <p>By May of '88, where we are now picking up the story, they had about 50,000
                    troops on the ground, including some of their best people and some of their best
                    air force units, pilots and air defense and so forth and significant amounts of
                    armor and what not, first of all in southeastern Angola, then in southwestern
                    Angola.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our analysis of why they were doing this? Was
                        this to get a better position for final negotiations, or were they going all
                        out to win or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, our analysis depended on who you spoke to on our team. There were
                    those, particularly senior people, who saw this as demonstrated evidence of
                    communist bad faith and who thought the Cubans were being reckless and
                    irresponsible and would in fact would provoke major South African countermoves,
                    at their expense.</p>
                <p>Those of us a little closer to the situation I think began to understand that
                    there was a psychology of wanting to negotiate from a position of strength and
                    to be seen as a winner even as one prepared to consider alternatives, such as a
                    mutual disengagement and a negotiated solution.</p>
                <p>But there was no outcome until there was an outcome. The debate continued and
                    those who were determined to sort of discredit our negotiation would write
                    stories in the various newspapers and congressional comments and so forth
                    saying, “Do you realize what the State Department is doing while the Cubans
                    increase their forces?”</p>
                <pb facs="0198" n="Page0198"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the South Africans responding?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: The South Africans were feeling out the other side through us. The May
                    '88 London meeting was really was the first time the South Africans in our
                    presence had a chance to interact with the Cubans and to figure out what each
                    was doing to the other and who was serious about peace and who was serious about
                    war.</p>
                <p>I'm laying the background here for a little discussion about the Soviet track,
                    because the Soviets had been distinctly unhelpful for much of the 1980's and
                    whenever we met with them, which we did, from time to time.</p>
                <p>Starting way back when Al Haig was Secretary and throughout the Shultz years we
                    had periodic bilaterals with the Russians on regional issues. This went into
                    higher gear once President Reagan met with General Secretary Gorbachev in Geneva
                    in 1985 and from then on these regional encounters became somewhat more
                    regularized.</p>
                <p>So there was a pattern and I got to know my Soviet interlocutors pretty well and
                    they got to know me and my team and we'd meet maybe twice a year. By the time we
                    got to 1988 this was more frequent and it was more interesting. And the
                    interlocutors changed and the Soviets increased their level at the table to the
                    deputy foreign minister level, with Anatoly Adamishin being their
                    representative.</p>
                <p>Adamishin was one of two or three deputy foreign ministers in the Soviet
                    structure and he had responsibility for things related to CSCE, to some of the
                    baskets within the Helsinki process, including issues related to human rights in
                    the Soviet Union itself and our dialogue with Moscow on that.</p>
                <p>He had responsibility for Africa. He had been their ambassador in London, so he
                    was an experienced watcher of conflicts in what they called “third areas,” like
                    Africa and Latin America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When he appeared on the scene, this was a real signal that
                        this was serious by the Soviets? They weren't marking time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yeah, it was an interesting signal, no question they were deploying
                    somebody who was of higher rank and who was a much more, shall we say,
                    sophisticated, Western-exposed and oriented. He'd been there ambassador in
                    London, he'd been their ambassador in Italy. So Adamishin dealt with
                    Westerners.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0199" n="Page0199"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Understood these peculiar people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Understood these kinds of people and understood the way they think and
                    the restaurants that they like and the clothes they wear and he had a taste for
                    that stuff himself, much better dressed than the typical Soviet bureaucrat.</p>
                <p>But he always brought with him a very crusty and seasoned foreign affairs section
                    chief named Vladilen Vasev who was probably twenty years older than he was and
                    he and Vasev between them were kind of good cop, bad cop but they were an able
                    team.</p>
                <p>And when it was agreed that we were going to meet in London, a place that
                    Adamishin knew very well, because he had recently been ambassador there, it was
                    also decided that we would open up a channel with him on the side of the
                    tripartite talks in May of '88 that took place in London.</p>
                <p>So from day one it was agreed (a) that we would talk in that channel; (b) that
                    they would not be at the table and (c) that they were not negotiating and they
                    were not physically observing, but they did like the terminology of “observer”
                    and we thought it might not be a bad idea to throw that little bouquet, by
                    saying in our public statements as we briefed the press that there was a senior
                    Soviet official who was in proximity to this process, but not in the process and
                    that we were keeping this person informed and briefed and we were asking them to
                    use their best efforts to encourage the process, we didn't get more specific
                    than that.</p>
                <p>But the Russians at that point, (May of '88), were still wondering what is the
                    shape of this deal, what is the likely outcome here, and how far are the South
                    Africans prepared to go to be reasonable and what demands are they making.</p>
                <p>And by the same token, how far are the Americans prepared to go and do they
                    recognize that the Angolans actually have a difficult situation, because they
                    have a civil war on their hands and they have an adversary in UNITA whom we were
                    aiding and the South Africans were aiding.</p>
                <p>So they were trying to see if they could encourage us to make gestures at the
                    conference table as well, in terms of the UNITA factor, the Savimbi factor, in
                    the whole process. So we had to fend them off on that and make clear that we saw
                    this as a sequential dynamic, in which the regional issues would get solved
                    first and then the internal issues could fall into place secondly.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we got to know each other pretty well. If I can go fast forward here,
                    after the May meetings, which were a decisive turning point, I then met
                    Adamishin again in early to mid-June in Lisbon. We arranged that meeting, that
                    was just a U.S.-Russian meeting, but of course we also talked to the Portuguese,
                    who had a lot of interest in this subject and who were very well briefed on
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0200" n="Page0200"/>
                <p>So I was visiting Portugal as part of my regular rounds, dealing with all
                    interested countries, but arranged to meet Adamishin in Lisbon. We had the
                    better part of a day, just the two of us, no note takers, nothing. It was really
                    quite a “get to know you” opportunity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, you two were together for almost a day. What do
                        you do? Give a little feel for what this means.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, what it means is you start with sort of factual updates of what's
                    going on and exchange impressions of what's going on and the state of mind of
                    the different players.</p>
                <p>And since I'm running the negotiation and the Russians don't disagree with that,
                    they're quite happy to have us be the party in the middle of this, the third
                    party, the Russians are quite happy to have us speak first and then they ask
                    questions and they also respond and they give their impressions of where things
                    are.</p>
                <p>It's fairly relaxed. We're sitting outdoors in the Portuguese sun, having coffee
                    and whatever else we're drinking, I don't know. But it lasted a fair length of
                    time.</p>
                <p>I don't have the exact memory of how many hours it was, but it was long enough
                    and since his English was good, Vasev's English, by the way, the other senior
                    Russian that we dealt with, Vasev's English was excellent, also.</p>
                <p>So the only time we had interpretation with the Russians was when we had some old
                    dinosaur like Gromyko or someone, or for that matter Shevardnadze. Senior
                    ministers tend to speak in their own language more than maybe the next level
                    down.</p>
                <p>But it was a fairly fluid interchange, because Adamishin was a quick study and he
                    understood what questions to ask and he could be capable of very sarcastic
                    questions about where we were headed on this process.</p>
                <p>I remember at one stage in Lisbon he looked at me with a bit of twinkle in his
                    eye and said, “Now, tell me, Mr. Crocker” and by that time we were actually
                    moving towards being on a first name basis, “You're asking me, you're asking the
                    Soviet Union, you're asking Russia, to be what, exactly? To be a wet nurse? To
                    be a midwife? You're not asking me to have paternity or maternity in this
                    process. But you are giving birth to something and you want me to help you give
                    birth to something,” he had a nice way of putting things.</p>
                <pb facs="0201" n="Page0201"/>
                <p>And he said, “Before I agree if I want to be a midwife or a wet nurse, what is
                    the shape of the baby we're going to give birth to? Is this going to lead of the
                    strengthened independence of all the countries in the region? Will South Africa
                    behave itself? Would it in fact withdraw from Angola and from Namibia? Will it
                    enforce and implement the UN plan,” which means confining the local South
                    African controlled police to bases in Namibia during the UN-led transition, and
                    that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>“Will the SADF, the South African Defense Forces, be under effective supervision
                    of the UN contingents of UNTAG,” which was to be the blue helmeted force.</p>
                <p>“And what about the issue of continuing links between South Africa and UNITA and
                    between the U.S. and UNITA?”</p>
                <p>So those were the kind of questions that we had to deal with. I had to impress
                    him with the conceptual and analytical validity of our grasp of the geopolitical
                    situation in Southern Africa including the constraints on all the main partieas
                    well as with the idea that we had a golden opportunity here because of the
                    chemistry that had developed between his leadership, Gorbachev and Thatcher and
                    Gorbachev and Reagan and that that chemistry needed to be exploited while the
                    iron was hot, so to speak, because Reagan was going to be leaving office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was a significant area of both confrontation and
                        cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States at this time,
                        wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I guess there were four baskets of issues with the Soviets, at least
                    four: there was arms control and there were baskets of bilateral issues such as
                    trade and human rights and freedom of emigration from the Soviet Union for
                    Soviet Jews and a lot of issues of that kind and then there were the so-called
                    regional issues and each of those had its own channel.</p>
                <p>There were the Africa regional issues, there were the Central American regional
                    issues, there was some dialogue about Southeast Asia, including Cambodia and
                    Viet Nam.</p>
                <p>And then of course the number one regional issue for both sides was Afghanistan.
                    And you could argue that it was the breakthroughs in the dialogue about
                    Afghanistan that set the stage for Adamishin reaching out and getting engaged
                    with us on Africa.</p>
                <p>I don't recall exactly what the sequence was there, but I suspect that the
                    Russians looked at Africa as less significant for them, but still a significant
                    investment. They had poured billions into the Angolan civil war, as they had
                    into the Ethiopian civil war. Their regional role and prestige was on the
                    line.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0202" n="Page0202"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Ethiopia in your discussions, or did you confine
                        yourself to Angola?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: When we talked generally we would mention the other conflict cases. But
                    there wasn't any ongoing negotiation in Ethiopia, so it was basically point
                    scoring, where we would point out that the Russians had been unhelpful in
                    opening a channel or encouraging the Ethiopians to engage with us, even though
                    we had sought to engage with the Ethiopians.</p>
                <p>And by engage I mean actually have a serious discussion about a path forward in
                    Ethiopian-U.S. relations. That had been vetoed and we know it was vetoed by the
                    Russians. It was vetoed in fact by certain people in the Communist Party, which
                    had a very important role in this process.</p>
                <p>We haven't talked about that yet, but in dealing with the Russian bureaucracy,
                    you had the foreign affairs ministry, of course, which is Adamishin and Vasev.
                    You also had the International Department of the Communist Party of the Soviet
                    Union which was very important on anything to do with “fraternal” relations with
                    socialist allies, of which Angola was one and then you had the military.</p>
                <p>So there were different parts of the bureaucracy here and we knew that the CPSU
                    had been very hard line on Ethiopia, so that dialogue never went anywhere. So
                    really the only practical African case was Angola. They were perhaps too
                    embarrassed to talk much about Mozambique.</p>
                <p>But I'm glad you asked the question, because there was kind of a hierarchy of
                    regional issues, from the standpoint I guess you'd say of both sides, but
                    particularly the Russian side.</p>
                <p>They had at one point 140,000 troops in Afghanistan. They never had any combat
                    troops, to my knowledge, in Angola. They had lots of advisors, thousands of
                    advisors, in fact and probably on occasion some seconded officers in command
                    roles, but not a lot of that and not formed combat units on the ground that we
                    knew about. Whereas the Cubans of course had the combat units.</p>
                <p>But the Russians had a lot at stake in Angola, in terms of pride, face, military
                    debts and all the rest. I'm certain that one of the reasons that they had
                    reached out to us, in this period of May, June, July of '88 and wanted to be
                    involved on the margins of the formal talks is to keep and eye on the Cubans and
                    of course on the Angolans. They never trusted the Angolans and they didn't have
                    much confidence in the Angolans. But they also weren't quite sure what Castro
                    was doing. And this gave them a window on all the parties: on us, on South
                    Africa, on Cuba and on Angola.</p>
                <p>I think diplomacy of this type has something in common with a singles bar: you're
                    talking to one side, but you're keeping your eye on a bunch of other players at
                    the same time.</p>
                <pb facs="0203" n="Page0203"/>
                <p>Anyway, so we had that discussion in Lisbon and when I reported that back to
                    Shultz he found it very interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any feeling at the time, we're talking about
                        spring, summer of '88. We're within a year of when the Soviet Union started
                        a rather precipitous slide, which ended up with no more Soviet Union.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Was the feeling, when you were talking to them the Soviet Union was in full
                    flower, as far as we were concerned?</p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, we knew by then something of their economic woes, but we certainly
                    did not foresee the accelerated collapse of late'89. It really wasn't until the
                    middle and latter part of '89 that you began to fully appreciate what was going
                    on.</p>
                <p>So what we were seeing was a lot of, I would say, baiting the hook by Gorbachev
                    and Shevardnadze and their colleagues to build new relationships with the West
                    and to build different relationships with each Western country.</p>
                <p>They were very adept at looking at the Germans and which Germans do you speak
                    with and looking at the Italians, the Russians have always been clever at
                    playing European politics.</p>
                <p>Still are, as a matter of fact, which is why you have the auto plant in Russia
                    named after the former head of the Italian Communist Party, Togliatti. Togliatti
                    and Berlusconi probably have a lot more in common than we know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All I know is, I was consul general in Naples at one point
                        in the late Seventies and I used to go to masses and I'd often be right next
                        to the guy holding the red banner of the Communist Party. We all went
                        together to these things and they crossed themselves like everybody
                        else.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: All in the same club.</p>
                <p>But I don't think we really had a sense of imminent collapse. But we did, by
                    then, have some sense of the degree to which the Soviets in their military
                    diplomacy, had failed in Angola and had raised the ante with lots and lots of
                    hardware which just got either captured or destroyed in every offensive, which
                    is why the Cubans came to us rolling their shoulders and with very erect posture
                    and very determined expressions on their faces and they'd glower at us and at
                    the South Africans.</p>
                <pb facs="0204" n="Page0204"/>
                <p>The Cubans were the ones who were asserting their macho in our faces, as if to
                    say, “You mess with me and we're going to escalate some more, buddy.” That was
                    what we were hearing from the Cubans, “We've resisted Yankee imperialism in our
                    hemisphere and we'll resist it here and if those Boer aggressors think that
                    they're going to get away with something, we will teach them lessons they will
                    not soon forget.”</p>
                <p>That was their style and body language. The Russians weren't like that, because
                    the Russians were kind of in the back seat. It was an interesting dynamic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then I guess we'll go back to May of '88 and what was
                        going on sort of in the main arena.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yeah, we should, but I just want to complete the point about the
                    Russians: from this point on they always had, at all of our major rounds of
                    meetings, they had somebody deployed in the city that we were meeting in.</p>
                <p>So we met in Cairo in late June of '88 and we met in New York at Governors Island
                    in late July of '88 and then we met in Geneva once or twice in August of '88. It
                    goes on like that, almost monthly, more than monthly, in some cases and there
                    was always a senior Russian there, often Adamishin, if not Adamishin then Vasev,
                    one of the two of them and they would be maybe not in the same hotel, sometimes
                    in the same hotel.And so it was convenient to have these debriefing sessions,
                    with whiskey and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Governors Island, you can't get to Governors Island unless
                        you're sort of invited. You just don't happen, have a senior Soviet official
                        happen to be saying, “Gee, I always wanted to go to Governors Island.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Right. He stayed in Manhattan. We briefed him, we would talk to him
                    before and after, but they were there and it wasn't just sending some
                    uninstructed junior embassy official, it was always somebody who was really in
                    the policy loop and would know what to make of the different messages and the
                    different information.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that in talking to Adamishin and his deputy
                        that you were really sometimes puzzling sort of jointly over the same
                        problem, “What's happening here?” because you had all these other forces
                        there and were you two sort of European type people trying to talk about
                        what the hell is happening down in this African land or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: We were groping to interpret sometimes, but of course our
                    interpretations had a point behind them always, because we were trying to
                    influence them or persuade them or sell them something and they knew it, so they
                    were trying to sell us something back.</p>
                <pb facs="0205" n="Page0205"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did you find that sometimes you both were sort of
                        puzzled about</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: When that would happen and it did happen occasionally, was in trying to
                    interpret the performance and the motives of individuals: “Why did the Cuban
                    senior official behave that way?” “Why did the South Africans announce that they
                    were leaving the talks before they'd hardly begun,” which was a typical South
                    African stunt, they'd come and they'd have a meeting and they'd say, “We don't
                    like the way this is playing out, so we're outta here!”</p>
                <p>So we would talk about interpreting behavior, but it tended to be quite personal
                    behavior: “Was so and so instructed to do that?” “Couldn't we get somebody else
                    to come from Luanda who might be better informed,” that kind of thing, rather
                    than the joint problem solving.</p>
                <p>But there was a time, I'm trying to remember the exact moment, it may have been
                    as late as November, I was sitting in my hotel and Vasev was sitting in my room,
                    nursing probably his third Scotch, maybe more, he could hold his whiskey and a
                    chain smoker, as I was at that point, and he looked at me and he said, “Mr.
                    Crocker, I have spent my entire career trying to block everything that you
                    people have been trying to do, in every region of the world. This is the first
                    time I've ever worked on a cooperative basis with an American official.”</p>
                <p>Maybe it was the third Scotch that led him to say that, but I've never forgotten
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It really is. The world was turning at that point. One
                        looks at the calendar and in hindsight you realize that things were
                        changing, for all of us.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: They were changing much more for them than for us in some ways. They had
                    persuaded themselves, if you look at the history of Shevardnadze and the foreign
                    ministry, we've all read about that period, he was trying to do a real mentality
                    change within the foreign ministry and not only inside but also outside the
                    foreign ministry, trying to convert the mindset of generations of Soviet
                    officials to be thinking about the possibility that you can give in order to
                    get, that you can have a win-win, that you can have cooperative security, all
                    these verbal niceties that he developed.</p>
                <pb facs="0206" n="Page0206"/>
                <p>And it began to have an impact on people like my crusty old friend here whom I
                    was talking about, who I think began to see the upside for the Soviet Union of
                    being an observer and being a participant in a process, even if it was our
                    process, because it would give them a window on it, they'd learn, they could
                    influence it at the margins.So it was a time of transition for sure. But the
                    fundamental decision that made for the breakthrough and I have to go back, now,
                    was Castro's decision to double the ante in Angola as a stage setter for
                    exploring a way to get out with 'honor'. And if he hadn't been prepared to do
                    that, I don't know if the South Africans could have done it without him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But at the time, when he doubled the ante</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: We didn't know it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a surge, to use</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Modern terminology.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it's a surge that marks a receding tide.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: That's right. The Cuban “surge” was probably decided shortly after the
                    seventieth anniversary celebrations of the October Revolution, when the
                    Russians, Cubans and Angolans were all in Moscow and that's when that
                    conversation I think I referred to earlier took place, in which the Cubans said,
                    “Look, if you want us to helpdig out of this hole, we'll take over the war and
                    run it our way. We'll raise the ante, but we want to be in charge of the war.
                    And we'll also join the talks.”</p>
                <p>So the Cubans really stepped up to the plate in November-December of '87 and then
                    the rest of '88. I don't think we really knew for sure, at least until July of
                    '88, if the purpose of this was to try and win, or to humiliate and bloody the
                    South Africans in a serious way, or whether the purpose was to use our
                    diplomatic framework as a vehicle for extricating themselves from a hideous
                    conflict morass, which it was for them. The diseases that the Cuban troops
                    brought home were unparalleled and the Cubans knew it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we evaluate the Cuban armed forces vis-�-vis the
                        South African armed forces?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0207" n="Page0207"/>
                <p>CROCKER: With difficulty, because they were so different. South African forces
                    were multiracial, but segregated, at the same time, with white officered black
                    commando units and then with all draftee white ground force units, a white air
                    force. The South Africans were tough and prepared to take casualties on the
                    ground. They had some of the world's best artillery.</p>
                <p>No doubt readers will have heard of the famous G5's and G6's. These were
                    developed by the South African arms industry, having either borrowed or stolen a
                    lot of technology from us and the Israelis and other people around the world.
                    But they had this long range artillery platform that was second to none in the
                    world and the Cubans and Angolans felt the impact of it quite a bit.</p>
                <p>So they were pretty good on the ground. We estimated that as the Cubans came
                    south towards Namibia the South Africans would stiffen and toughen and if they
                    tried to come across the Namibian border the Cubans and Angolans would be in
                    deep trouble.</p>
                <p>On the other side, the Cubans, thanks to the Soviets, had much superior air force
                    equipment and air defense equipment and the South Africans had trouble in the
                    sky and they risked losing planes every time they flew over some of those areas
                    that had been built up and reinforced by Cuban air defenses.</p>
                <p>The South Africans had upgraded and modernized their inventory of Mirage
                    fighter/interceptors buying modern avionics, new French engines, using local
                    facilities supplemented with help from the Israelis and the French. They built a
                    limited inventory of these upgrades (Cheetahs), but were anxious not to expose
                    them to too much risk against the top Cuban Migs and latest Soviet supplied air
                    defense.. Helicopters were kind of a mixed picture.</p>
                <p>In any case, we knew the Cubans had their best people down there, people who were
                    very senior in the Cuban chain of command. The South Africans had their best
                    people there.</p>
                <p>So the interesting thing about this meeting in London in May of '88 was that we
                    recognized we had very complicated negotiating teams that included soldiers,
                    intelligence people and diplomats, in each of the three teams.</p>
                <p>And at one point I said to the top South African and Cuban military reps, “Do you
                    think it would be useful if you two peeled off and had a side meeting and if so,
                    we have arranged rooms in this place we're meeting in,” which was a small,
                    private hotel, “We've arranged rooms in which it's quite possible for you to
                    take a break and go upstairs and get to know each other.”</p>
                <p>And to my delight, the South African chief of defense staff Jannie Geldenhuys
                    then went up to the Cuban chief of staff, a guy named Rosales del Toro, and they
                    agreed to talk with interpreters in a room upstairs and talked for two
                    hours.</p>
                <pb facs="0208" n="Page0208"/>
                <p>And I have no doubt that they were talking tough to each other about intentions,
                    about who's going to outlast whom here and who is worried about whom here. My
                    impression is that the South African general told his Cuban counterpart, “We
                    fought the British Empire to a standstill from 1899 to 1902, we bled the British
                    Empire for three years. We're a small country, we're a small group within that
                    country, the Afrikaners, but we will die rather than be humiliated by your
                    efforts to export communism to Africa”. And the Cuban response was probably
                    along the lines of “We don't leave here until Namibia is free. We don't leave
                    here until Angola is protected” and so on.</p>
                <p>But it was important I think for then to hear each others' story and get a
                    measure of each other. So we opened up that channel and it was necessary to do
                    that.</p>
                <p>But our own estimate varied, depending on who you talked to. I remember being
                    asked by the Seventh Floor of the State Department, including Secretary Shultz
                    and his Under Secretary for Political Affairs, repeatedly, “What are the Cubans
                    doing? What do they think they're doing,” because as they began pushing from the
                    south east to the south west, that takes them down to the Cunene River basin,
                    down right towards the Namibian border. “Are they planning to go into Namibia?
                    What do you think, Chet? Aren't the South Africans going to clean their clocks
                    and isn't this going to escalate?”</p>
                <p>We tried to make the point that both sides had their limits and that it wasn't
                    totally clear that this was the precursor to a major clash. But I suppose there
                    had to be a clash and there was a clash, not in May, but in late June, and that
                    clash set the stage in a way for a mutual recognition that they were kind of
                    stuck.</p>
                <p>They were facing each other in southwestern Angola, just across the border from
                    each other with significant numbers of tanks and artillery and forward deployed
                    aircraft and so forth. They had a small confrontation around the Calueque dam on
                    the Cunene River, and they lost a few people on each side. That was the last
                    major direct combat engagement between Cubans and South Africans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Up to this point, the South Africans had not really been
                        engaged, it was UNITA that was doing the fighting and</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: No, no, South African ground forces had been engaged most recently up at
                    that Battle of Cuito Cuanavale, which we talked about, which was in southeastern
                    Angola and that was in the immediate aftermath of the 1987 military offensive.
                    South Africans were on the ground there in modest numbers, by which I mean a few
                    thousand men.</p>
                <pb facs="0209" n="Page0209"/>
                <p>So there South Africans fighting inside and they put a lot of pressure on the
                    Angolans and the Cubans in a particular area, southwestern Angola, but then they
                    pulled back, because they weren't trying to take a major city.</p>
                <p>So the Cubans and the Angolans held at Cuito Cuanavale and after that, I'm
                    talking now January of '88, they then began to move down to southwestern Angola.
                    So there had been some previous South African engagement with the Cubans
                    directly.</p>
                <p>But in June of '88 there was a significant tactical clash that produced some
                    casualties, right near the Namibian border. But it didn't continue and expand,
                    it was quickly and skillfully contained by commanders on both sides. And I think
                    it was contained because the diplomacy was intact and diplomacy offered a
                    framework for proceeding forward.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well as they moved towards each other and there's this
                        initial clash, were you seeing this as, “Oh, my God, here goes all we've
                        been working for” or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: This took place right in the middle of a series of planned meetings and
                    we had been planning periodic negotiating rounds and so our best way of testing
                    things was to see if the meetings would stay on schedule, and they did.</p>
                <p>But, yes, it was a nail biting time. We weren't sure how far this would go and we
                    weren't sure what conclusions the sides would draw from it. But in fact the
                    conclusion they drew is that, “Hey, this could get bloodier, and do we really
                    want this?”</p>
                <p>The analogy I use, they were like scorpions in a bottle and they were trying to
                    get out of the bottle without killing each other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we aware of the strain that particularly disease and
                        all was putting on the Cubans, because in South Africa, of course, these are
                        people who live there. You're fighting on your borders, but the Cubans, you
                        have a problem of putting expeditionary troops, we're having the same
                        problem today in Afghanistan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: The Cubans of course were in Angola, which is a little different terrain
                    than Namibia. When you get down that far south it's more arid and some parts of
                    Angola are semitropical or tropical, so there was lots of disease of that kind
                    and also disease that was based on a complete absence of sewage systems or fresh
                    water, just awful breakdown of the entire health infrastructure of Angola.
                    Angola's a big place and Cubans were deployed in lots of different parts of
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0210" n="Page0210"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Cubans prided themselves on their medical system. I
                        would have thought that it would have carried over, so that they would be
                        able to take care of their troops.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, they could take care of them, but they also knew that when they
                    came home they were coming home bringing things that they'd never seen before
                    and they didn't care for that.</p>
                <p>It also was a significant drain. It's not totally clear and won't be for some
                    time, the extent to which they were getting quickly paid in hard currency by the
                    Angolans with the Angolan oil revenues, which were dollar based revenues.</p>
                <p>But we don't know for sure whether the Cubans felt that they were breaking even,
                    making money, losing money on this proposition. Or, for that matter, whether the
                    Russians were being generous towards them, in terms of military credits and that
                    kind of thing, because most of the hardware was Russian.</p>
                <p>So I'm not saying that the whole thing was driven by health concerns, but I think
                    it just added to the list of things that kind of impressed to the Cubans that,
                    “If we could get out with dignity, we should try to do it and maybe this crazy
                    American diplomacy” led by this crazy State Department team of people who've
                    been trying to do this now for seven years, “Maybe this American diplomacy could
                    be a vehicle for us to achieve, combined with some macho performance on the
                    battlefield, our stated goal, rather than just to keep doing it forever and ever
                    and ever?” We were inclined to think that Angola had become a sort of Cuban
                    Vietnam - their troops presence exceeded ours in Vietnam in terms of the
                    percentage of our populations</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a compromise goal in mind that you felt was
                        achievable and acceptable to both sides, in the back of your mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, as I learned from this process, there are maybe three pieces to a
                    settlement, three pieces to a peace agreement. One piece are the broad political
                    principles, who is recognizing which international legal norms and is the
                    settlement consistent with the UN Charter and the OAU Charter and other things?
                    Is the settlement normatively acceptable? Is it acceptable in terms of our
                    long-standing declaratory principles? That's one ingredient.</p>
                <p>The second ingredient is the specifics of things like withdrawal schedules and
                    implementation of agreements and plans for the UN forces and so forth, timing of
                    the elections, milestones for troop disengagement, that kind of thing. That's
                    obviously where the devil's in the details and all that stuff.</p>
                <pb facs="0211" n="Page0211"/>
                <p>The third is, is this deal going to meet both sides, or all sides, political
                    requirements? Can all sides say, “You know, on balance, this was pretty good for
                    us. We leave with dignity, or we got what we needed, or we achieved our
                    objectives.”</p>
                <p>It's like declaring victory, but not quite, because there wasn't going to be
                    victory on this one. There was going to be win-win.</p>
                <p>But I'm afraid to tell you that I had to learn that there were those three
                    distinct parts by doing it, rather than having some idea from the outset that
                    there were those three parts and that maybe the last was the most important, in
                    a sense that for Castro and for PW. Botha and his colleagues, they really had to
                    be able to say, “We did okay! We brought home something.” The Cubans would want
                    to claim they had assured the survival of the Angolan regime and protected the
                    country's security while contributing through their presence to Namibian
                    independence. The South Africans would need to be to claim that they would be
                    able to decolonize Namibia without the Cubans in the neighborhood. Cubans would
                    be leaving southern Africa and they'll be going in the context of the
                    implementation of the UN Plan. From a South African perspective this means that
                    SWAPO never 'liberates' Namibia by means of armed struggle. This is not done
                    with guns; independence is negotiated with diplomacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in some ways you're saying that the intervention of
                        the Cubans, which, obviously we decried, was handy, because it threw
                        something in that eventually, if you got rid of it, everybody would be so
                        happy to get rid of it that they would accept less, maybe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, what it did was to create a basis for a linkage-based solution,
                    where you link one agenda to another agenda and you solve the problem. You solve
                    the problem of South African “illegal” occupation of Namibia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you have to bear in mind sort of African tribal
                        politics? The African leaders have often quite a different agenda than the
                        Cubans or the South Africans or even the Americans or the Soviets.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, of course we had to deal with the politics of decision making
                    inside the MPLA regime, which was and still is a very strange combination of
                    forces. So we had to try to understand what drove it, what their priorities were
                    and I think we eventually figured out what their priorities were. Regime
                    security of course came number one. Being able to keep control of their access
                    to the oil revenues.</p>
                <p>On the UNITA side, we were aware that that was a different regional and tribal
                    base and that getting to the point of reconciliation between the MPLA and UNITA
                    was going to have regional tribal or ethnic implications, about power sharing.
                    We understood that.</p>
                <pb facs="0212" n="Page0212"/>
                <p>Savimbi would tell us when we talked to him that those people in Luanda, they're
                    basically Portuguese, mestico, communists and they're basically from one ethnic
                    group and they're kind of a self-anointed aristocracy and they're not the real
                    Angolans, “I'm the real Angolans. Look at me!”</p>
                <p>Savimbi had a very dark complexion and his people tended to be. They weren't
                    mesticos. They were mainly Ovimbundus.</p>
                <p>So we took that analysis into account, but I don't know if you'd call it a tribal
                    analysis, so much as just the role of ethnicity in governance.</p>
                <p>And when it came to the other African states, like the front line states, they
                    were not dealing with us on a tribal basis, they were dealing with us on a kind
                    of ex-colonial basis. They were testing us: “What are you as a superpower going
                    to do to get control of that racist minority regime in South Africa? Are you
                    serious? Can you deliver?” So I call it a neo-colonial complex, more than
                    anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you have all these things playing out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: A lot of things playing out at once, that's right. Carrying water on
                    both shoulders, or whatever. But there's a kind of universality I think to some
                    of these principles about getting to a peace agreement. I think any leadership
                    group needs to feel that they can sell it at home.</p>
                <p>And we're facing that now in the Middle East. What can they sell at home, given
                    the complexity of what's at home.</p>
                <p>But you asked me a very good question about did I have in mind a kind of
                    settlement formula and we learned it by doing it. On the specifics of the
                    tactical issues of withdrawal schedules, we knew that the Angolans and Cubans
                    had said that they would be prepared by this point to commit to a four-year
                    withdrawal schedule. The South Africans would have to be out of Namibia under
                    the UN plan much earlier than that, the first 12 months.</p>
                <p>So there was an asymmetry here and we had to get rid of that asymmetry and we
                    knew we had to get rid of it, we'd never get the South Africans to the altar on
                    this thing if the Cubans were still there four years later, that's just not
                    going to work and it wouldn't work at home, either.</p>
                <p>I wouldn't want to take this back home to Ronald Reagan and say, “Guess what, Mr.
                    President, the Cubans are coming home, but not on your watch!”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0213" n="Page0213"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're showing me a picture in Prof. Crocker's book, High
                        Noon in Southern Africa of you talking to Ronald Reagan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: This was at a point, this would have been late November, early December
                    of '88, we had a withdrawal schedule agreed between the South Africans, Angolans
                    and Cubans that would get all Cubans out of Africa within a specific time
                    frame.</p>
                <p>And I showed him the charts and the graphs and the geography and the maps and so
                    forth and said, “They're going to go from here, they're going to redeploy to the
                    north, they're going to get on ships and planes and they're going to fly home,
                    Mr. President.”</p>
                <p>He listened and looked at me and he nodded and he said, “But, Chet, do we really
                    want them back in this hemisphere?”</p>
                <p>“Thanks a lot, Mr. President. I've been working for seven years to get them out
                    of Africa!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems like each time somebody gets into this
                        negotiating a peace, it's on the job training. At the time you were there,
                        was sort of your academic experience playing a role, or was this so
                        theoretical you just had to discard it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: It's an excellent question. I've often said that that having done it in
                    practice I came back to the academy to see if I could make it work in
                    theory.</p>
                <p>What that meant was that I have really dug into the literature, in the theories,
                    in the approaches that are out there, in social psychology and political science
                    and law and other disciplines and I've now written and edited seven books in a
                    series produced by the United States Institute of Peace, all of which are
                    focused on aspects of your question, which is trying to bridge theory and
                    practice.</p>
                <p>The background that I had when I was doing it, back in the Eighties, was a
                    background in history and I think a background also in listening to other
                    people, immersing yourself in the culture of the other, that's something I think
                    I've tried to do in my life, whether as a teacher or as a student, as a scholar,
                    whatever.</p>
                <p>Being able to listen and being able to put yourself in the head of the other
                    person and sometimes in their language is a terrific asset in peacemaking. So
                    I've focused on that.</p>
                <p>But I had not done any formal training in negotiation or mediation when I did
                    this.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0214" n="Page0214"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To me, as an outsider in this whole thing, it seems that
                        there's always such a tremendous gap between those in the academic field and
                        those that are practicing. One, the people that practice it don't have time
                        to read what those who write about it write.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: They have more time than they used to and we're trying to change that at
                    the U.S. Institute of Peace, by having short courses and all sorts of things for
                    professionals, for practitioners, to come in and get an immersion in mediation,
                    for one week.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is so important, because you don't have that much
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: And the Foreign Service doesn't have the staff to put people in for a
                    year of training, like the military does. So you do need the right kind if
                    course work.</p>
                <p>And here we have all these special envoys that this administration has appointed
                    and some of them have worked these kinds of issues before and are really damned
                    good at it, like George Mitchell, I happen to have terrific respect for him,
                    he's done it before, he understands intuitively and he's probably done more
                    reading than we give him credit for, but he's got a real feel for it. And of
                    course Holbrooke and Ross have been doing it.</p>
                <p>But you have to ask yourself whether more could be done to acquaint people with
                    some of the basics of how do you structure an agreement, how do you make peace
                    look more attractive than continued war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is November 12, 2009</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: The meetings in London in May of '88 the first time really that we had
                    senior levels of all three delegations assembled in one place. The Russians had
                    their man, Adamishin. The talks took place at a private hotel called Durrants on
                    George Street, which just north of Oxford Street in London, a rather low key,
                    low visibility place that our embassy Africa watchers had selected because
                    nobody had ever heard of it and the media wouldn't be able to find it, at least
                    not right away. Of course eventually the media did find it and began staking it
                    out and asking all kinds of questions.</p>
                <p>It was an interesting choice and the ambience was affected by the fact that the
                    South Africans felt that this hotel was kind of beneath their normal standards
                    when they traveled on diplomatic missions.</p>
                <pb facs="0215" n="Page0215"/>
                <p>The Cubans had never been shopping in London in their lives and were just
                    thrilled with the opportunity to be right next to Oxford Street. The Cubans had
                    to leave their side arms at the door at Heathrow when they arrived in their
                    special plane and they arrived at Durrants Hotel holding video camcorders
                    because El Jefe (the boss) back home wanted to see the visuals of this event.
                    The Cubans had a coming out party in London in May of '88, is what it boiled
                    down to. The Angolans, a little more worldly, were there with their Cuban
                    friends.</p>
                <p>We had a day and a half of meetings. Maybe the side sessions were more
                    interesting in some ways than the main event at the table. We gave everyone a
                    chance to vent at plenary, with us in the middle and then the joint
                    Cuban-Angolan team on one side and the South Africans on the other.</p>
                <p>Plenty of time for venting and saying things for the record, lots of note takers,
                    it was all very official and officious, and obviously you were not going to get
                    a whole lot of serious business done in that kind of a formalistic venue, but it
                    had to happen, it had to be done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is something one hears again and again, used to if
                        you go to Palestine or you go to Israel, you get an entire history going
                        back to 5000 B.C. and then you gradually move up and you have to sort of sit
                        through this each time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>As somebody who's been around for a while, is this necessary, to have to listen
                    to this?</p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yeah, it is necessary, if the parties want to do it. And of course,
                    whether they want to do it is a function of who the parties are, who their top
                    spokespersons are and sometimes if they deploy very senior people then it's
                    necessary for them to have some airtime just to vent for the record books and
                    for replaying at home.</p>
                <p>But these actually were reasonably well-led delegations on each side and the
                    right people were there, just before ministerial level. If you want to avoid too
                    much sort of 'show and tell' dramas you want to be just below ministerial level,
                    in my experience, at least with this particular negotiation.</p>
                <p>Once the ministers get there, it's really pretty hard to control the thespian
                    performances of some of the actors, they have to carry on and be seen carrying
                    on.</p>
                <p>I was flanked by Hank Cohen from the NSC and Jim Woods from the Defense
                    Department and each of us said a few words to set the stage and then let the
                    parties talk.</p>
                <p>But the interesting things that took place were in the side bar exchanges. We
                    encouraged the sides to sit down and have a meal together, or whatever.</p>
                <pb facs="0216" n="Page0216"/>
                <p>We didn't really solve anything in the May talks, except that we created a
                    tripartite face-to-face negotiating process, we agreed to get back in touch
                    about scheduling the next round of talks and we agreed to put forward ideas if
                    the parties wished us to, but the parties weren't yet there, they were still
                    pretty far apart and they were still feeling each other out.</p>
                <p>So we left with press statements that kind of said the parties had had
                    constructive meetings and they'd been frank and free in their discussions and
                    the usual kind of stuff that one says at a fairly preliminary round of direct
                    talks. Mind you, we'd been doing this in separate channels, separate talks, for
                    seven years, but this was the first face to face meeting..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Two things: one, I have to ask this, the Cubans came in,
                        what about cigars? The Cubans relish their cigars, which are on our
                        forbidden list. Were cigars in prominence at the meeting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Cigars were in prominence at the meeting. Back in those days, there were
                    a lot of smokers around that table, so I think the owners of Durrants were kind
                    of wondering what in earth they had agreed to do, hiring out their primary
                    meeting facility for a day and a half to this crowd.</p>
                <p>There were about sixty or seventy of us in the room altogether. It's a lot of
                    people, a lot of smokers.</p>
                <p>Q; Was the media interested in what was going on?</p>
                <p>CROCKER: Once it leaked that the talks were taking place on British soil and HMG,
                    Her Majesty's Government, had agreed to host them then the usual Africa watchers
                    and there are a lot of Africa watchers in London got very ginned up and we were
                    fending off calls from the BBC and from the Financial Times, the Guardian and
                    the Times of London and so on.</p>
                <p>And we had a little stakeout on the final day outside this hotel, which the
                    management was very unhappy about, maybe about a dozen journalists or so with
                    cameras and I said a few words and then offered the microphone to the South
                    Africans and the Cubans and Angolans. There was some spinning going on, but it
                    was civil and fairly proper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Cubans taking the opportunity, this is really
                        about the first time they really were able to be in the limelight in London,
                        wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: The Cubans were amusing, because they just didn't know the ground rules
                    for visiting London. They had to be told all the time what the ground rules
                    were, about how you proceeded. But they probably enjoyed themselves, too.</p>
                <pb facs="0217" n="Page0217"/>
                <p>I think the Brits were quite delighted to be hosting, but the questions that we
                    got were “Why Britain?” I had to be at some pains to make it very clear why
                    Britain, because Britain was our closest partner in this exercise, had been for
                    years, knew this brief backwards and forwards, inside and out and was very
                    supportive of the whole process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they playing a role inside the meetings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Not in the meetings, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they in the meetings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: No. Nobody else but us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we pushing the Brits out, or did the Brits want to
                        stay out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: They wouldn't have wanted to be in; they'd want just a measure of
                    separation from all this, in case it blew up, in case nothing resulted and to
                    create a clear distinction between their own roles and ours.</p>
                <p>It was just perfect for them to be the hosts and to provide security and
                    facilities and to meet and greet at Heathrow and that sort of thing. But they
                    knew that we would be telling them everything that was useful and relevant in
                    any event, didn't need to be worried about being in the meetings and didn't want
                    to be.</p>
                <p>Nor would the parties want them. The South Africans wouldn't have wanted Brits in
                    the room.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really, we didn't have the baggage in Africa that the
                        Brits had, either.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Especially with South Africa. No, we didn't. We had different baggage.
                    We had a lot of baggage in Angola.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And a lot of baggage with Cuba, too!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: It was just different baggage and we had earned this role, after seven
                    years plus.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0218" n="Page0218"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you approached this, was there a plan, for anybody
                        involved in this type of thing, were there sort of general guidelines of how
                        to run these things, or were you learning as you went?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I think it's fair to say, bottom line, that we were learning as we went.
                    I don't think the United States, at that point, had a long history or guidebooks
                    about how you do a mediation.</p>
                <p>Negotiation, we knew about that , but mediation is a very different art form.
                    It's a subset of negotiation. Mediation, where you're actually carrying water on
                    both shoulders and you actually want to listen in an equitable manner to both
                    sides, even if you have views and interests of your own, that's a special art
                    form. We didn't get trained in it. We weren't previously prepared for this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to call on union mediators who've been doing
                        this for a long time? It's a different set of issues, but at the same time
                        it's the same type of approach.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: My boss, George Shultz, was a former Secretary of Labor and he would
                    sometimes tell me some very straightforward and helpful things from his own
                    experience involved in labor-management negotiations.</p>
                <p>You can't force parties to move forward. They have to be strong enough to move
                    forward and they have to be able to speak for themselves and you've got to let
                    them speak for themselves and you've got to let things develop, I think would be
                    the way that he would put it.</p>
                <p>He also would say to me very frequently that negotiation that's not backed by
                    power and leverage doesn't go anywhere and that includes us as mediators, but
                    also the parties. The parties weren't going to negotiate very far from a
                    position of weakness. They had to be strong enough to negotiate. That is
                    extremely important in running a mediation.</p>
                <p>We also had to keep our ears open and we should have done a better job of this I
                    think, looking back, to what might be available to us from non-official
                    channels, not so much about how to do it, but rather to listen and learn more
                    about the attitudes of the parties.</p>
                <p>And occasionally when we did talk to outsiders we learned things from academics
                    who were in meetings with Soviet counterparts, that kind of thing. So that was
                    useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On that, were you getting useful tips from, say, the CIA,
                        but also from academics about the mindsets of Cubans? We really hadn't been
                        dealing with the face to face before.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: No, that's right and the most interesting thing that we didn't have good
                    expertise on was the Soviet-Cuban relationship, which was the dog and which was
                    the tail.</p>
                <pb facs="0219" n="Page0219"/>
                <p>And as we went through, it became very clear to me that the Cubans were making
                    their own decisions and driving the Angolans; and the Soviets, they were there,
                    but they weren't driving this process, either militarily or diplomatically. But
                    we didn't know that at first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A recent BBC documentary made the point a couple of times
                        that the Cubans sent troops to Angola without prior clearance from their
                        Soviet counterparts back in Moscow. I don't know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Which year was this?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this was I guess earlier on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: When they first went in?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Back in the mid-Seventies? That may be the case at least with the
                    initial Cuban initiatives with the Angolans and the early small scale dispatch
                    of technicians and advance units.. The Cuban decisions to escalate in 1987-88
                    were discussed between Cuba and Moscow back in November of '87.</p>
                <p>Castro basically said, “We're prepared to double the ante here in terms of
                    troops, on one condition: that we run the war.”</p>
                <p>But it was hard for us to know as much as we know in retrospect about the
                    relationships there. As a general principle I would say from my experience that
                    the intelligence we had was vital, but it was never more than ten per cent of
                    what we would have liked to have.</p>
                <p>There were always huge holes in what we knew and we knew that were lacking
                    fundamental information all the time.</p>
                <p>We had good support from our Agency colleagues and particularly by this point in
                    the chronology, when we no longer had the adversarial relationship between State
                    and CIA, we were getting very good support.</p>
                <p>Secondly, we got excellent support from our British colleagues, both diplomatic
                    and intelligence colleagues and we talked to them all the time to compare notes,
                    that sort of thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0220" n="Page0220"/>
                <p>But there was a lot, as I said, that we only could learn by doing. We didn't have
                    a master plan, to get back to your question. We had a sense that there'd have to
                    be a “getting to know you” phase and then we would have to decide then about the
                    sequencing of the issues.</p>
                <p>It was much too delicate or too hot to start out by talking about, “All right,
                    what compromises are you prepared to make on the timing of withdrawal of
                    troops?” These are the most delicate security issues. You don't start with
                    them.</p>
                <p>You start with general political issues and getting people to understand that no
                    one's going to dictate to anybody else, this is going to have to be a process in
                    which the two sides actually can recognize that they're going to have to help
                    each other get out of the mess they're in.</p>
                <p>They're still testing each other, but from our point of view there was actually a
                    stalemate, and we wanted to prove to them that there was a stalemate, but
                    without saying it, because if you say that, then people say, “Oh, the American
                    mediator's trying to soften us up.”</p>
                <p>So you don't ever say that, but the goal was to convince them of what we knew to
                    be true analytically, which was that there was a deeply entrenched strategic
                    stalemate between the sides.</p>
                <p>It's not so much a battle line. There were very few lines. If you look at Angola,
                    Angola is larger than Western Europe south of Scandinavia. They're no lines in
                    Angola. Half of Angola is empty, there's almost no one there. So it wasn't so
                    much fixed lines.</p>
                <p>When I say strategic stalemate, what I mean is South Africans were tough as hell
                    on the ground and they had the world's best artillery and they had very good
                    special forces. The Cubans had superior air defense and they had air
                    superiority, in fact and they also had some pretty good armor they were
                    beginning to deploy towards the south.</p>
                <p>But the Cubans were far away from home and longer the Cuban lines inside Angola
                    became the more vulnerable they'd become. And vice versa, if South Africa
                    overplayed its hand and had long logistics lines all the way up into central
                    Angola, then it would become very vulnerable to Cuban air power.</p>
                <p>So on the battlefield there was a stalemate, but politically there was a
                    stalemate. Here you had an isolated South African government, you had an
                    isolated Cuban government, you had a very dependent Angolan government.</p>
                <p>No one was really in a position, as we saw if, to dictate, but did they know
                    that? That was the question. And it wasn't totally clear that they understood
                    the extent of the stalemate.</p>
                <pb facs="0221" n="Page0221"/>
                <p>So as I said, the question for us was how do we sequence this, what do we talk
                    about and how often do we meet after the London talks? So we left London
                    agreeing to get in touch with the parties as to when the next meeting would take
                    place, to make a proposal for the venue and the time for the next meeting and
                    that turned out to be quite a difficult situation, I had to go have a separate
                    meeting with the parties and then to meet with my Soviet counterpart in Lisbon
                    to try and figure out why is it so hard to get agreement on a venue. This was a
                    venue negotiation now, when do we meet next and where?</p>
                <p>Of course the South Africans said, “Come to South Africa.” The Cubans said, “Come
                    to Cuba.” Neither one of those was going to be a starter.</p>
                <p>We tried various options. We tried the usual place, Geneva. For some reason that
                    didn't appeal to the parties. We tried various options. It was only after a lot
                    effort that the Egyptians agreed to host the next round of talks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have any idea why there was this problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yeah, they were pushing each other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To see who would give?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Pushing us and pushing each other, yes. It was all about, “Well, it's
                    your proposal, so I'm not accepting.” So it had to do with that early testing
                    process.</p>
                <p>I mentioned that there was a stalemate, but the sides hadn't yet fully understood
                    that they were going to go to closure, they didn't believe it yet and certainly
                    their superiors didn't believe it yet and there might need to be some more
                    testing going on.</p>
                <p>So we got to Cairo in mid-June, at a large hotel not far from the Cairo airport
                    and there were nice facilities and there were lots of attendees and once again
                    the Soviets sent a senior person.</p>
                <p>This time it was not Adamishin, it was his deputy, Vladilen Vasev, who came. He
                    didn't attend any of the meetings, but we talked to him after each round, to
                    show that we were in fact willing to do that and to volunteer information and to
                    ask him, “What are you hearing, Mr. Vasev? What do you think the problems
                    are?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dealing with the Soviets at the time, did you get any
                        feeling that they were beginning to wonder what the hell was happening in
                        their country with Gorbachev?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0222" n="Page0222"/>
                <p>CROCKER: We didn't talk about that. We didn't hear much about it, either. We
                    would hear things about the progress that Shevardnadze was making in
                    reorganizing the foreign ministry, which was part of perestroika, but we didn't
                    get into what's happening more broadly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you didn't feel that</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Things were falling apart? They weren't, at that stage. Not yet.</p>
                <p>But of course the Afghan process was moving along in parallel. That was
                    moving.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any feel, in talking to the Soviets,
                        about the Soviet-Cuban connection? Were they together “like lips and teeth,”
                        as the Chinese used to say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I don't think so, but the evidence was scant. I think there was enough
                    cultural distance between the Soviets and their Cuban and Angolan fraternal
                    allies. Sometimes we heard interesting things.</p>
                <p>One of our problems in Cairo was that the delegations were led by people who were
                    too senior and so there was this playing to the galleries problem that I
                    referred to and there was a tendency for the parties to speak for the record and
                    to score points on the other side.</p>
                <p>The Cubans fielded a very senior member of the Cuban Politburo at that time named
                    Jorge Risquet, who was not the senior Cuban we had in London, but since he was
                    the ranking Cuban he got the microphone and did all the talking and he talked
                    and talked, which is a great Cuban tradition, but not a tradition that was
                    appreciated by the South Africans, or, for that matter, by us, all that much. He
                    would actually go on for 45 minutes.</p>
                <p>As it happens, the South Africans fielded Pik Botha, the foreign minister and the
                    defense minister, Magnus Malan, each of whom also were pretty good talkers. Pik
                    Botha said, at one point, “If you think you can talk, you ought to hear me get
                    going. I'll meet you outside”</p>
                <p>It wasn't funny, though, because it sounded like somebody was about to run to the
                    airport or to break off and rupture.</p>
                <p>So at one of the meals at Cairo I pulled this senior Cuban, Risquet, aside and I
                    said, “Senor Risquet, you do realize that your style at the table is having a
                    predictable consequence of bringing out the worst in the other side and I know
                    what the worst on the other side is like, because I've been subjected to it
                    myself on occasion.”</p>
                <p>And he said, “What do you mean?”</p>
                <pb facs="0223" n="Page0223"/>
                <p>I said, “Well, you're a little windy, Senor Risquet and you also seem to think
                    that history was written by Cubans, for Cubans and always will be.”</p>
                <p>And he put his hand on my knee and he said, “Senor Crocker, you don't know our
                    history and our traditions. We have been making cigars in tobacco factories for
                    generations, reading history and poetry and literary readings to keep the work
                    force entertained and informed. This is where I come from. You know, our best
                    cigars are rolled on the thighs of virgins while we give speeches and have
                    readings.” This was his effort at Cuban culture 101.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Miami, there's quite a few stories about the Jewish
                        cigar makers in Miami. Always one of their number would read from books and
                        that sort of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>And also, El Jefe, Castro, was prone to go on and on and on.</p>
                <p>CROCKER: But this was unhelpful by Risquet. The point I'm leading to is that I
                    then went to the Soviet, Vasev and I said, “Is this the best the Cubans can do?
                    Why did they bring him?”</p>
                <p>His initial reaction was not very helpful. He said, “It's up to them to decide
                    who they'll have as their head of delegation.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Well, if you have any input at all in this process, I would suggest
                    that maybe he's not the ideal person to lead the Cuban team the next time
                    around.”</p>
                <p>And I feel the same thing way, frankly, about the two South African ministers who
                    came and I said this pretty bluntly to the delegations at lower level, on each
                    side. They understood the problem, but it was still a time of testing. We didn't
                    get that far in Cairo.</p>
                <p>The Cairo round took place right on the eve of the final military offensives of
                    the war. This might not have been accidental. They were testing each other at
                    the conference table and they were testing each other on the battlefield.</p>
                <p>The Cubans were moving more armor south, down towards some hydroelectric
                    facilities that were quite near the Namibian border. Right after Cairo the South
                    Africans called up the Citizen Force reserves, 140,000 men.</p>
                <p>And of course that's partly for theater. They called up the reserves. They didn't
                    actually field 140,000 men, but they called them up and the reason they did that
                    is they saw Cubans moving towards the Namibian frontier, and they were not
                    totally sure what the intentions of the Cubans were. The Cubans had armor which
                    might have kept on rolling south.</p>
                <pb facs="0224" n="Page0224"/>
                <p>At that juncture, I remember being called upstairs in the State Department by
                    Secretary Shultz, who had the same intelligence about these Cuban movements down
                    towards the Namibian border. And Secretary Shultz said to me, “Chet, what are
                    they doing? Do they really think they're going to take on the South Africans,
                    they're going to go into Namibian? Do they have any idea what the South Africans
                    are capable of” and so forth.</p>
                <p>I replied to him, “You know, Mr. Secretary, each side could hurt the other. They
                    have advantages of different kinds and I'm not persuaded that they really want
                    to do that, but they're testing each other. The Cubans go too far, they'll get
                    their clocks cleaned, but the South Africans have real limits, too. They can't
                    get new aircraft, they have not got up to date air defenses.”</p>
                <p>And the way I've described it in my memoirs, it was like scorpions in a bottle
                    trying to get out, but they were not disarming themselves, either. So there was
                    a clash around Calueque and Techipa, the two facilities just north of the
                    border, it took place in the very last week of June of '88. The South Africans
                    lost a plane or two and took a few casualties. The Cubans lost a bunch of stuff
                    on the ground, the South Africans hit them pretty hard and they stopped, pulled
                    back and separated.</p>
                <p>The antennae were up, they were twitching, they were anxious, but they separated,
                    they did not have any renewal. This lasted like two, three days and then it was
                    over, the last clash of the war. Of course, again, we didn't know at the time it
                    was the last clash of the war, but that's what it was.</p>
                <p>So, we had to figure out how to corral these parties and get them to agree on a
                    sequence for discussion. And until they had had enough testing of each other of
                    this kind, at the table and on the ground, it was not that easy to tell what the
                    sequence would be.</p>
                <p>For example, if we said to them, “All right, this is getting dangerous. Let's
                    have a cease fire” or “Let's have an agreement on military de-escalation,” I
                    don't think it would have worked, because they would have said, “Well, we
                    haven't even got the outlines of an agreement, why should we? We believe in
                    fight and talk.”</p>
                <p>It's my view and I have felt this way for the past twenty years, based on this
                    experience, that the starting place in a mediation is not de-escalation of the
                    military, or at least it's not necessarily the starting place, because you need
                    a political framework or climate, of some kind, in order to create the kind of
                    ambiance that supports de-escalation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any good analysis from your military
                        people, the military attach�s and also analysts back at the Pentagon, on
                        what was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0225" n="Page0225"/>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes, but it tended to be a little bit polarized, until we got to the
                    point that we could put on the ground our military people in a tripartite
                    military commission framework, where they would be there and get them to have
                    live communication and interaction rather than static charges, reports, denials
                    and so forth.</p>
                <p>And if one side was suddenly very anxious about what the other side was doing, it
                    could communicate to us, not in diplomatic channels, but in more technical
                    channels. It was hard to do that until we got to the point of greater confidence
                    and practical thinking; and this came after the next round of talks, that we
                    actually could do that. We couldn't do it until the New York Governors Island
                    Agreement that was reached in mid-July of '88.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the South Africans feeling the loss of an ally in
                        Bill Casey? He was dead by this time, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that particular, you mentioned earlier you were
                        fighting on two fronts, in a way. Did this have an effect, did you
                        feel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, there were several things that had changed fundamentally that were
                    probably having an effect. There was no such thing as a unified South African
                    view, Stu, during this period.</p>
                <p>The South African team included people who agreed with our basic approach and
                    hoped it would work and people who were opposed to our basic approach and hoped
                    it would fail and their superiors in different bureaucracies back in Pretoria
                    had different views.</p>
                <p>The State President, we weren't sure where he was. So there were a lot of
                    opinions in the South African team, but until we got to New York and then to
                    Geneva in August of '88 and maybe even well beyond that there was not a unified
                    South African view towards this.</p>
                <p>So some of the people on the South African team probably, to pick up your
                    question, would have said, yes, “Where's Bill Casey when we need him?” And
                    others were probably just as glad that he was no longer a factor.</p>
                <p>But other things were happening. You had the phenomenon of Gorbachev and his
                    seduction of Maggie Thatcher and Franz-Josef Strauss and eventually Ronald
                    Reagan, which of course that also filtered down to South Africa, that this was a
                    new Russia.</p>
                <p>It was a more complicated scene than they were used to.</p>
                <pb facs="0226" n="Page0226"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, we're going to go to what led up to the meeting on
                        Governors Island, New York, in still '88, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes, July '88 .I've just described the Cairo process and the escalation
                    in southern Angolan at the end of June.</p>
                <p>I think that this was a critical turning point, both diplomatically and
                    militarily and the parties may have sense that this perhaps was a moment to take
                    a deep breath and see if we could agree on anything. What could we agree on?</p>
                <p>We decided to bite the bullet and propose talks in the U.S. as a next event and
                    we specifically proposed New York and Governors Island, which is in New York
                    harbor, because it's a Coast Guard facility and it can be secured and it's not a
                    bad place to hold meetings and we got permission from the authorities to do
                    that.</p>
                <p>People stayed in their hotels in New York, but they'd take a ferry out to
                    Governors Island. The only amusing thing about that venue was that there was a
                    large memorial on Governors Island to the sinking of the Maine during the
                    Spanish American War.</p>
                <p>And the Cubans hadn't realized that that was there. When they arrived, they took
                    one look at the display - ship cabins, cannon balls, photos of the event — and
                    said, “Oh, my God, did we have to come here?” because it sort of reminded them
                    of a sore point in Cuban-American relations.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we had two days of meetings on Governors Island, 19th and 20th of July.
                    And, again, very large delegations, lots of set piece, for the record, kind of
                    statements, but the right people in the room.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't have the kabuki players and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: No, we didn't have the ministers. We began asking questions of the
                    parties about when they thought it would be the right time to begin work on a
                    possible common document of some sort, because a peace process needs eventually
                    to get to the stage where you can agree on something.</p>
                <p>And it was at that point that one of the sides suggested to us that, well, maybe
                    we could get some principles of agreement that we could talk about, some general
                    principles and what principles might we hold in common?</p>
                <pb facs="0227" n="Page0227"/>
                <p>And the Angolans came forward and said, “Well, we clearly have to be based on UN
                    Security Council Resolution 435 on the independence of Namibia. That's got to be
                    one of our principles. That's sacred writ for everybody in the room, we assume.
                    And that's the basis for the transition of Namibia, so surely that's one of the
                    principles we could agree on.”</p>
                <p>The South Africans listened and nodded. They weren't going to make an issue of
                    that, because in fact everyone knew if we're going to have a settlement it would
                    be based on Resolution 435.</p>
                <p>The South African would come back with a point such as, “Well, another sacred
                    principle in terms of the United Nations and the world community is
                    non-intervention in internal affairs. And you and you,” pointing to the
                    Angolans, “You have ANC bases which are focused on creating terrorist incidents
                    inside South Africa. So an important principle is non-intervention.”</p>
                <p>Of course that opened the door for the Angolans, “Yeah, and look what you're
                    doing with UNITA and Savimbi, in our internal affairs. You're inside our
                    country.”</p>
                <p>So it was that sort of a discussion, but the idea that was beginning to gel was
                    that there might be some principles that people could agree on. At this point,
                    in my memory of what took place, there was a lunch break and I decided to sit at
                    lunch with the head of the Cuban delegation, a fellow named Carlos Aldana
                    Escalante. Aldana was a labor negotiator and senior member of the communist
                    party, he came out of the labor movement in Cuba, a savvy guy, very practical
                    and confident in his approach. We had had good talks prior to Governor's Island
                    about several issues, very sensitive issues to do with Savimbi and UNITA and how
                    would Angola survive if the Cubans left and so forth.</p>
                <p>So we had lunch and we talked about, “How do you persuade the South Africans that
                    this is a serious process and it has a future?”</p>
                <p>At that point, Aldana said to me, “You know, Mr. Crocker, where I come from it
                    will be a proud day when the last Cuban has come back from Africa. We'll have
                    parades. We'll have celebrations. We'll have fireworks when all the Cubans have
                    come home. This has been a difficult war. For us, it's as big as your
                    Vietnam.”</p>
                <p>And he mentioned the social and health costs .. He said, “I know you think we
                    make money out of this and that we are being paid by the revenues Gulf Oil and
                    the Soviets pay for everything, but it's not true. We pay for a lot ourselves. I
                    just want you to know that this will be a proud day when we can get our Cuban
                    troops out of Africa, having accomplished their mission.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, what does that mean?”</p>
                <pb facs="0228" n="Page0228"/>
                <p>“When Namibia is independent and South African aggression against Angola ceases.
                    That's what accomplishing our mission means.”</p>
                <p>So I said, “Well, that's interesting. What you're basically doing is saying you
                    agree with linkage and that it's all linked together in one package, that we
                    have to have a withdrawal schedule for the South African and for your forces and
                    it has to be in conjunction with Resolution 435 implementation and it's all one
                    package, right? What you've just told me is powerful stuff, but I can't tell it
                    to the South Africans. They won't believe me. Only you can tell it to the South
                    Africans.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Oh, heavens, I can't speak like that to the South Africans. They would
                    twist it and distort it and take it out of context and go public with it.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, that's a test of this process. Let's take a break and I urge you
                    to think about whether you shouldn't just tell the plenary meeting down the hall
                    exactly what you just me told me at this lunch table,” there were only four of
                    us at lunch, “Because they need to hear that and they need to hear it from
                    you.”</p>
                <p>So that's what we did. Back at the plenary meeting, I said, “Well, we've had
                    lunch. I think it's the Cuban team's turn to speak. They may have some thoughts
                    about political principles.”</p>
                <p>And Aldana got the mike and he gave the speech that he'd given me, basically. You
                    could have heard a pin drop in the room. It was electric, dramatic. An eloquent
                    vision of the future with some candor and some very explicit statements
                    recognizing and endorsing the necessity of a settlement based on the principle
                    of linkage and explaining how an agreement incorporating linkage might be
                    structured. The South Africans asked for a break and their delegation head, Neil
                    van Heerden said to me “You know what, we need to digest this, because what he
                    said is important. And what we'd like to propose is that we take Senor Aldana
                    back to Pretoria with us, because if we tell the boss what he just told us, he
                    won't believe it. And you, Crocker, we respect you, but if you told the boss, he
                    won't believe it. We've got to find a way to take the Cubans to Pretoria with
                    us.” This was of course a figure of speech; they knew that President Castro
                    would hardly authorize his head of delegation to fly down to South Africa.</p>
                <p>But this was a psychological breakthrough moment, because what you were hearing
                    at the table was that there could be a win-win, that there was a way to shape
                    and frame this so that a deal could develop around principles that would meet
                    the political requirements of South Africa, Cuban and Angola, because it would
                    be in the context of having achieved what they all claimed they were
                    seeking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, all during this process, how did Savimbi, our
                        basic support of him, fit in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0229" n="Page0229"/>
                <p>CROCKER: It fit in every side conversation, but very rarely at the formal plenary
                    table. Why? Because it would have forced everyone to say things that would be
                    unhelpful in front of other people.</p>
                <p>The Angolan-Cuban team knew that South Africa still had troops inside Angola and
                    was still helping Savimbi. They knew that we were still helping Savimbi. So we
                    talked about it off line.</p>
                <p>I mentioned Aldana, we talked with him at length about this issue and the
                    importance for them to understand that as the South Africans left Namibia the
                    possibility of logistical support for Savimbi would decline, just as Cubans were
                    leaving Angola and their logistical support for the MPLA would decline and there
                    would be roughly symmetrical reduction of outside support for the two Angolan
                    factions, which would lead to them having to come together.</p>
                <p>And they listened and they understood what we were saying. There was no
                    agreement, but we talked about it; we got it out on the table in these side
                    meetings quite regularly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Savimbi have a representative across the street?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: No and this was of course a problem, because there were people who were
                    not in the room who wanted to be informed. SWAPO, the leading Namibian
                    liberation movement, didn't, either. And so the various sides would brief these
                    two organizations off line, but they weren't at the table.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As the Americans, we didn't feel we needed to brief these
                        people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Oh, yes, and we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes, we did, too. But I'm sure the Russians did, the South Africans did,
                    the Angolans did, everybody did, with their own spin. One reason for the
                    misbehavior sometimes of parties who were not at the table is that they'd been
                    subjected to conflicting spin, they didn't know fully what was going on.</p>
                <p>But they couldn't be at the table. This was a negotiation between governments. If
                    we'd said, “Savimbi has to be here,” the Angolans would have said, “The ANC
                    needs to be here.” It would have blown up before it started.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0230" n="Page0230"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you start getting into the shape of the table, as we
                        had with the Vietnam talks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Right, and you start negotiating the future of apartheid; it was just
                    not going to happen. You can't have too many people and too much on the agenda.
                    It just doesn't work. You've got to have a focus. So that was the focus.</p>
                <p>But we did keep Savimbi informed and he was distrustful, to the end of his days,
                    'til the time he was killed, he was distrustful. He was a distrustful man,
                    paranoid sometimes, with a lot to be paranoid about, frankly.</p>
                <p>But we tried to persuade him that the best possible outcome for him was an
                    outcome in which there were no Cubans in Angola and he would nod, say, “Yes, I
                    agree with you, but I don't trust them. And I don't trust you.” It was never an
                    easy conversation.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the outcome at Governors Island, New York, was very important. It led to
                    something called the New York Principles, which were signed on July 20, 1988. TO
                    the uninitiated they sound a lot like the Ten Commandments ,but it included and
                    this is very carefully worded language I'll quote from: “Agreement that there
                    should be redeployment towards the north and the staged and total withdrawal of
                    Cuban troops from the territory of the Peoples Republic of Angola, on the basis
                    of an agreement between Angola and Cuba and the decision of both states to
                    solicit on site verification of that withdrawal by the UN.”</p>
                <p>So what do we have here? We have an agreement that there will be total Cuban
                    withdrawal, redeployment and then withdrawal and that it will be on a timetable
                    determined by Angola and Cuba, it doesn't mention South Africa or the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>So that's an art form in which we said, “Look, we don't have to be the signatory
                    of the withdrawal treaty, but the South Africans have to agree to and accept the
                    terms that are in it. It's your agreement, an agreement between two allies, but
                    the South Africans will have to agree to it.”</p>
                <p>Then Principle Four, “Respect for the sovereign equality and territorial
                    integrity of all states, non-interference with the internal affairs of all
                    states, abstention from the threat and use of force against the territory of all
                    states” and so forth. Sounds like standard UN prose but it had particular
                    salience and significance in the content of these interacting and intermixed
                    wars in which everyone was mixed up in neighbors' affairs - the ANC based in
                    Angola, SWAPO based in Angola, UNITA supported by South African forces from
                    Namibia, and so on..</p>
                <p>Principle N: “Recognition of the mediating role of the United States of America.”
                    It's just a page, but it's a page of solid gold, and it made all the difference.
                    Once we had that, we had our first joint agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0231" n="Page0231"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How'd you draft this thing? Did we have this in our
                        pocket, or somebody would suggest wording? How did this come out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: At the plenary there'd be suggestions for what principles needed to be
                    in the agreement and then we'd break and we'd prepare text and then the text
                    would get massaged, most often in side talks, not hammered out in plenary.</p>
                <p>That third principle that I mentioned was extremely delicate, took a lot of time,
                    because we had to persuade obviously ourselves and the South Africans that we
                    could accept the fact that the withdrawal schedule would be as a result of a
                    bilateral treaty between the two communist allies, but there would also need to
                    be a tripartite agreement that would serve as a chapeau over the whole thing.
                    And at the very end of the day - when the negotiation concluded six months later
                    - we had a tripartite and a bipartite treaties, mutually reinforcing and
                    interdependent..</p>
                <p>But there were a lot of issues like that. The wording of things, you can imagine
                    some of the language that might get people into trouble. Here's one where you
                    can image there was debate: “Reaffirmation of the right of the peoples of the
                    southwestern region of Africa to self-determination, independence and equality
                    of rights.”</p>
                <p>You can drive a Mack truck through that. Who the hell are “the peoples of the
                    southwestern region of Africa?” Does this mean that the Herero people of Namibia
                    have their own state? Does it mean that the Ovimbundu people of Angola have
                    their own state?</p>
                <p>No, it doesn't mean that. But it means the peoples, as defined in UN Charter
                    terms, who live within colonially-defined territorial states.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there tribal difficulties in Angola?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Angola, it's not a monolithic state. This was just their
                        problem, the Angolan government's problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: UNITA, the rebel movement, its social base was the Ovimbundu people, who
                    were the largest ethnic group in Angola, but they were also among the least
                    developed, in economic terms. They don't live around the capital city, they're
                    in the center and the south.</p>
                <p>There were clearly tribal issues. There were also ideological and power
                    issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0232" n="Page0232"/>
                <p>In the case of Namibia, SWAPO is based on the Ovambo people, who are the majority
                    people in Namibia and there was never any question that in a free and fair
                    election the Ovambos would assure that SWAPO wins.</p>
                <p>So there are issues like that and of course in South Africa there are issues like
                    this, of race and of tribe. But the word tribe is not PC. You don't use the word
                    tribe in these kinds of negotiations. You talk about states and governments, not
                    tribes.</p>
                <p>It's not very honest, maybe, but it's a reality. If you had tried to talk about
                    tribes in a negotiation like we had on Governors Island, we would have had
                    people walking for the door.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this the breakthrough, or was this just the beginning,
                        or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I guess you'd say it was the beginning of the endgame. We had our first
                    joint agreement, there were signatures. That's important stuff, when you have
                    signatures.</p>
                <p>So it was the beginning of the endgame, but we didn't have several things. We did
                    not have agreement on a military withdrawal schedule. We did not have agreement
                    on a de-escalation process, how to control the risk of incidents blowing things
                    up, because there's always that risk, these armies are still deployed out there.
                    There was nothing about timing or about implementation.</p>
                <p>And we didn't have treaty language. We had principles, we didn't have treaty
                    language. We didn't have an agreement on verification. We didn't have agreement
                    on the role of the mediator going forward, or the date when the UN would get
                    involved in the process, because the UN had not been involved in this
                    negotiation directly.</p>
                <p>So there were a lot of things that had to be worked out and we took some of those
                    issues up at our next round of discussions, which took place in Geneva in August
                    of '88.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had signatures and all, you knew there was progress,
                        but to the outside observer, when are the troops going to get out of there
                        and when is this going to happen? Progress in the middle of something is
                        kind of hard to display.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Oh, sure and especially when you brief the American press. The State
                    Department press corps is a very jaded bunch, veterans who've been there
                    forever. They say things like, “You've said there's been progress for about
                    seven years now.”</p>
                <p>So you're right, but within our ranks we knew this was an important step. It
                    wasn't peace in our time, but it was an important step.</p>
                <pb facs="0233" n="Page0233"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about an election year. In the normal course
                        of events, you didn't know what was going to happen. And so did you feel
                        that</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Time was running out? Well, we knew time was running out. What we didn't
                    know was whether the parties were focused on it at this stage, July of '88,
                    enough to think it was important. Of course it's a tricky ball to play.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Always, because maybe you'll get a mediator more amenable
                        to your position.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: So we didn't try to play that particular card at that point. Later on,
                    we did. We did some coaching, later on. We didn't play it at this stage, but we
                    were certainly aware of it.</p>
                <p>We had had meetings with the parties in one format or another since January and
                    we were getting into a rhythm now, where I was on the road virtually every month
                    with my negotiating team and that was 12-15 people. We were moving around the
                    world in this negotiation and in motion all the time - for the past six
                    months.</p>
                <p>The parties were getting used to the idea of when's the next meeting, where is it
                    going to take place and who shall we send as our head of delegation, that kind
                    of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you ever looking towards having a meeting in
                        Cuba?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I had enough problems in Washington without that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is March 4, 2010</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: As this peace process developed in 1988, it kind of went through a
                    period of what seemed to us like endless acceleration. The rhythm of meetings
                    got more frequent, the sense of pressure got greater, because we had
                    accomplished some things, but we hadn't yet gotten to the goal line and so there
                    was a sense that if you don't keep momentum, you lose momentum and if you lose
                    momentum you're toast. So you've got to keep momentum, you've got to keep the
                    initiative, and the clock is moving.</p>
                <p>The clock was moving for Ronald Reagan, because it was coming up to the end of
                    his second term. That was one timing factor. But there were a lot of other
                    timing factors, having to do with the fragile state of what progress we had made
                    by July of '88.</p>
                <pb facs="0234" n="Page0234"/>
                <p>And so as I look back I think the architecture of this process included some
                    “getting to know you” sessions, face to face “getting to know you” sessions, it
                    included some pushing and shoving at the table, it included a final phase of
                    military escalation on the ground in southwestern Angola that we've already
                    talked about, that was in late June.</p>
                <p>And then it included the construction of a two-page document called the
                    “Governors Island, New York, Principles” which were agreed in the middle of July
                    of '88. Those principles, as we've discussed, if you read them, they look a
                    little bit like the preamble to yet another UN Security Council resolution.
                    They're a little bit legalistic and there's a lot of kind of diplospeak but they
                    really were significant, because they provided us with a foundation for the
                    house. A house has to have a foundation and that was the foundation.</p>
                <p>And to get to those principles required the most interesting and quite deft to
                    acts of statesmanship by the leaders of the delegations, to actually begin
                    treating each other at the table with respect, giving each other credit for
                    concessions or verbal gestures that were made, recognizing that each side had
                    political requirements and talking in that manner, rather than “Why don't we
                    step outside and I'll show you what I'm made of” kind of talk.</p>
                <p>We sensed that the July Principles really were a foundation. The next move took
                    place in the middle of August in Geneva, when the delegations arrived to see how
                    do we build on the New York Principles, what's the next step?</p>
                <p>Well, it was quite a dramatic time. We had I think four days of meetings and we
                    always seem to wind up in one or another of those diplomatic hotels in Geneva
                    and the different delegations stayed in different places. But we had a good
                    meeting facility that was made available to us actually by the Swiss foreign
                    ministry, which opened up some good facilities that we could use.</p>
                <p>But on the first day of this round we were surprised to hear and the Angolans and
                    Cubans even more so that the South Africans had been very busy: they came to
                    Geneva with a full blown, comprehensive proposal to settle everything.</p>
                <p>This was quite stunning, because it was “Okay, guys, here it is. Here's our
                    proposal and we are going to table it and we want you to reflect and if you need
                    more time we can go to the airport and come back another day, but here it
                    is.”</p>
                <p>It was quite dramatic. It addressed the issues of ceasefire. There wasn't yet a
                    ceasefire. There was a stand down, if you like, but there was no ceasefire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is a “stand down,” as opposed to a ceasefire?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0235" n="Page0235"/>
                <p>CROCKER: They just weren't moving around a lot. They were in place and they were
                    not out on aggressive patrols, looking for trouble. The forces that were engaged
                    in Angola were separated from each other and they were staying where they were,
                    they weren't out in active combat patrol mode.</p>
                <p>So in that sense it seemed stable, but there was no agreed ceasefire and so that
                    obviously had to be discussed. There had been, in the interim between the New
                    York and Geneva sessions, there had been a meeting of military delegations on
                    the island of Cape Verde, which is a place that the parties often liked to go
                    to. South Africans, Cubans, Angolans went there.</p>
                <p>We were not at all sure that that meeting had produced any progress. There had
                    been some signal sending, but it wasn't clear that there was real tangible
                    progress on defining a ceasefire, but there was talk about having some kind of
                    mechanism for military to military communication. So we knew that that issue was
                    on the table.</p>
                <p>The South Africans proposed, as they came in the room in Geneva, “Let's have a de
                    facto ceasefire and let's set target dates for completing this negotiation.” Let
                    me be very precise here. What they wanted to do was to say that all the Cubans
                    would have to leave within either seven or ten months, depending on when the
                    clock starts, from today, all the Cubans out of Angola. There were 50,000 at
                    this point.</p>
                <p>And they proposed to start the clock rolling on the UN Plan in ten weeks (!) by
                    the first of November, if my memory serves. November of '88, the UN would begin
                    deploying into Namibia.</p>
                <p>That means that between August 15th and the end of October we have to finish
                    negotiating everything: the withdrawal schedule, the ceasefire, the stand down
                    of political rhetoric, some kind of understanding on respect for each other's
                    sovereignty, that's code language for not harboring rebels, working out some
                    arrangements for the implementation period.</p>
                <p>So the South Africans were asking the Angolans to stop providing bases to the
                    ANC. And I think the South Africans also recognized that they would be asked to
                    stop promoting UNITA's offensive activities and in turn South Africa would say,
                    “We hear you on that, but then you have to stop active combat patrols against
                    UNITA. So there has to be a zone of safety for UNITA if you want us to stop
                    supporting them..</p>
                <p>So there were a lot of different military issues here. Anyway, this was a bold
                    South African plan put on the table.</p>
                <pb facs="0236" n="Page0236"/>
                <p>The Cubans and Angolans were not amused, because there was no negotiation going
                    on here, this was a unilateral proposal.. They wanted a recess and they came to
                    us and said, “What is this? What kind of a stunt is this?” They were very upset,
                    because they saw it as a stunt. They said, “Are they about to go public with
                    this, because if so then we're going to have to go public.”</p>
                <p>So there was a real problem of calming nerves down. We had good delegation
                    leaders in Geneva, fortunately and they were people who we could work with and
                    get things gradually calmed down.</p>
                <p>But it took some time to calm them down. The Cubans and Angolans said, “We've
                    seen your proposal, thank you very much for responding to our proposal” of last
                    February or January, because they had put forward, back at that time, a four
                    year schedule for Cuban withdrawal (as contrasted with 7 months in the South
                    African bid).</p>
                <p>So we then had both sides putting things on the table related to the critical
                    military issues: we had a four-year plan and we had a seven-month plan. It took
                    some time to get them to agree on practical steps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm looking at the South African proposal. Was this a
                        stunt? Were they asking for more? Did it represent really certain practical
                        developments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: It was what you would call an opening bid, a very raw and somewhat
                    provocative opening bid, because logistically getting all those troops out of
                    Angola in seven months would have been a challenge; and the purpose of it was to
                    try to force the Cubans to look at the idea that they had to get out of Angola
                    before there could be an election in Namibia.</p>
                <p>And so it was rigid, front-loaded withdrawal schedule that they had in mind and
                    the Cubans were offended, the Angolans were offended. Of course they're very
                    good at getting offended. As George Mitchell once said of some of his Irish
                    interlocutors, they would go a hundred miles to receive an insult.</p>
                <p>So they got offended, even more so when there was some quite slick press
                    backgrounding by the South Africans, who had some friends in the press that they
                    had brought with them to indicate that the South Africans had taken a bold
                    gesture for peace and that they were really stepping up the pace of negotiations
                    and challenging the other side to see we could get everything agreed so we could
                    start the UN plan by the first of November.</p>
                <p>Well, once one side goes public like that, as you will appreciate, it puts the
                    other side kind of on the defensive and they've got to go public with something,
                    so there was some press hype.</p>
                <pb facs="0237" n="Page0237"/>
                <p>But by the end of the four days in Geneva we had actually put together something
                    we called, not very originally, a “Geneva Protocol,” it must be about the
                    eightieth Geneva Protocol in modern diplomatic history, but, anyway, this one
                    including the terms of reference of a de facto cease fire, it did establish a
                    joint military commission between the sides, which was a very important step, it
                    did talk about the target date of November 1st, even though all sides recognized
                    that this was hyping the pressure on ourselves and could lead to disappointment
                    down the road.</p>
                <p>So what we had done at Geneva was to put our arms around some of these immediate
                    military issues. By the time we left Geneva in the middle of August the obvious
                    remaining issue was the great gap between the different troop withdrawal
                    calendars.</p>
                <p>So here we are in late August. I'm on vacation. Everybody knows that there's one
                    huge issue left, because a lot of other matters had been addressed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Including a ceasefire?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Including a ceasefire and it's sort of holding, it seems to be holding.
                    There are no incidents of note. There are some communications to do with
                    primarily how do the Cubans and Angolans keep SWAPO from messing around and
                    crossing the Angola-Namibia border and trying to continue infiltration into
                    Namibia, because SWAPO was not officially a party to this interim ceasefire, it
                    was not at the table and neither was UNITA.</p>
                <p>So we were talking to three states. We did not have the liberation groups, if you
                    want to call them that, at the table. So we had to rely on the states that
                    controlled them, or influenced them. It was quite complicated trying to figure
                    out how to avoid the kind of difficulty which insurgents could create. There
                    were ANC insurgents, as well.</p>
                <p>So I think it's fair to say that we had a de facto ceasefire and a mechanism for
                    observing it and for talking to each other when there were violations. We had
                    military communications set up, so the sides could reach each other by
                    radio.</p>
                <p>But the big issue was the gap on the Cuban departure schedule and how that would
                    be linked up to the South African departure from Namibia.</p>
                <p>I am in my vacation place in the Adirondack Mountains in the third week of August
                    of 1988. I get a call from my staff assistant in the AF Bureau saying, “Chet,
                    would you be willing to come and meet with two senior South Africans? They have
                    some concerns, some questions and they want to talk to you — now.”</p>
                <pb facs="0238" n="Page0238"/>
                <p>And so we agreed on a place and my staff assistant flew up to Kennedy Airport,
                    met the two visiting South Africans, escorted them up to a lodge on Lake George
                    and I drove down from my place in the central Adirondacks and we met for a full
                    day with the top guy in their military intelligence and the number 2 of Neil van
                    Heerden, the head of the South African delegation.</p>
                <p>We're sitting in the Adirondack sun, swatting the occasional deer fly, and they
                    really wanted to put cards on the table: “Where are we going with this process?
                    How do we get clarity about Cuban sincerity? They have a lot of additional
                    troops. We've got to get a front loaded schedule of withdrawal, meaning lots of
                    Cubans leave early. Otherwise, there's a great asymmetry in the calendars
                    because of our (South African) timing commitments in terms of UN Res. 435.”</p>
                <p>Not to belabor this is in too great detail, there were four very difficult
                    meetings between that rendezvous on Lake George and the middle of October, and
                    they were very frustrating meetings, because what you were seeing was a shoving
                    match between the sides about what was politically acceptable to each when it
                    came to the degree of 'parallelism' on the withdrawal schedule and how would you
                    verify, how would you guarantee, and all kinds of “what if” questions were being
                    asked.</p>
                <p>We met in Brazzaville repeatedly, we met in New York, we had a series of rounds
                    and it was very demanding, a very accelerated negotiating schedule. And there
                    were times, I think, quite frankly, when it looked like we were running out of
                    time to maintain a sense of momentum and to conclude this process.</p>
                <p>The U.S. election of 1988 was the first Tuesday of November. It seemed like maybe
                    the parties were going to possibly piss away the great opportunity that we
                    thought lay before them. So we didn't have the highest sense of confidence
                    during those four meetings.</p>
                <p>And it was agreed eventually that we had to go back to Geneva and really give it
                    a final push. So I'm now moving ahead from those four meetings, which were
                    basically, how can I put it, they were close-in work, they were hard work and
                    they simply were a learning process in which parties talked at each other and
                    tried to educate each other about political requirements that each had. The
                    sides were down to their few remaining cards on the main issue - though there
                    were other important topics raised from time to time (including side
                    conversations between the Angolans and South Africans on the delicate issues of
                    ANC bases and support for UNITA).</p>
                <p>By the time we got to Geneva again in the middle of November, I'm moving ahead,
                    now, to November of '88, this really was almost a do or die, in a sense. The
                    election was over.</p>
                <p>Ronald Reagan's term of office was going to come to a conclusion in two months
                    and it was not automatic that under the new George H. W. Bush administration
                    there'd be continuity of policy or people.</p>
                <pb facs="0239" n="Page0239"/>
                <p>So the sides were kind of wondering about whether mid-November '88 was a great
                    moment to grab and get it done or was it going to be a time when people say,
                    “Let's wait and see what happens.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've had this happen I know in negotiations in Korea and
                        other times. People said, “Well, different administration, even in the same
                        party, we might get a better deal” or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Or, “We might not have to deal.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you playing this card?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes. We were playing it, but trying not to overplay it, because if you
                    overplay it then it looks like the mediator is the one who is most needy, when
                    what we wanted was for the parties to have needs.</p>
                <p>The mediator's leverage is a function of the parties' needs (and I am quoting the
                    leading scholar of mediation, here, Bill Zartman). If the parties don't need
                    you, then you're running around looking for work. So we didn't want to seem too
                    eager and, frankly, we thought they would probably sober up and get the
                    point.</p>
                <p>But we did play that card, yes, we did play it. We pointed out that there was no
                    guarantee of a continuity of policy, that George Bush, while he supported what
                    we'd been doing, he was a different president, he might have different
                    priorities, there's a lot going on in the world.</p>
                <p>I at one point made a comment, when I was finished chairing a very frustrating
                    session of mostly intense side meetings in New York, I remarked to the parties
                    in plenary session that the American people wouldn't know what Angola was if it
                    hit them over the head, they might think it was a form of imported cheese and as
                    for Namibia, they'd never heard of it. And I made that statement and the
                    delegation heads actually got quite angry, because what I was saying to them
                    (though not in so many words) was: “Get real, guys, or I'm out of here! The U.S.
                    has other things on its plate.”</p>
                <p>So we did try to play that card to some extent and I suppose it probably worked
                    in some way. They probably looked at this and said, “We also have invested years
                    of effort and time on this.”</p>
                <p>I remember going to Cuba six months later and Fidel Castro saying to me that he
                    was cross, that he thought there might be damage to “his” peace process, he used
                    that pronoun: “I thought my process was in jeopardy.” So there was some
                    ownership there.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is what you want, of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that the other parties had time constraints
                        or other things that were happening</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: There of course were things going on in all the countries. South Africa
                    was very much the polecat of the international community at this point. It was
                    feeling the isolation impact of both symbolic and real sanctions. We knew that
                    service in 'border wars' was not popular with white draftees in the South
                    African forces. There was feeling that there was a need to find a way to get
                    extricated, but only if it could be done in a way that was honorable and proud,
                    which is exactly what Castro's view was. In effect both leadership groups were
                    saying “I need to leave with my head held high.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this process, were you up against another major
                        factor and that was the dislike on the part of our political masters of
                        South Africa? Were they saying, “Do this, stick it to the South Africans,”
                        with no regard to the peace process, but just as part of the political
                        process, to show we were doing something to the South Africans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: There was some of that in the Congress, but of course there was another
                    side, which was the people in our political system who were not at all happy
                    with the fact that we were talking to the communists at all. So there was some
                    degree of push from both sides.</p>
                <p>There was a point at which there was some talk in the Congress and I don't have
                    the month but there was some congressional initiative to maybe pass yet another
                    sanctions bill on South Africa.</p>
                <p>And I remember going up to the Congress with Colin Powell and talking to the
                    Democratic leadership in the House and we heard from people like Tony Coelho and
                    others that there was some pressure and that they were thinking about doing
                    something more.</p>
                <p>And Colin turned to me and said, “Chet, what do you think?” And I said, “Frankly,
                    if you want to terminate this peace process, that's a great way to do it.” The
                    congressmen were not impressed with that argument, particularly; nor was Colin
                    Powell as I recall. There were few people in our system who grasped the
                    significance of this negotiation as one that was at a decisive stage and could
                    become transformative for the region.</p>
                <pb facs="0241" n="Page0241"/>
                <p>But within the administration most people understood that we had to deal with
                    this in a balanced way, so we tried to keep the balance there. There already
                    were sanctions. We didn't need more sanctions.</p>
                <p>Anyway, so we get to the middle of November, let's say the 15th, 16rh of
                    November, back again in Geneva and at this point the issue of withdrawal
                    schedules was one that could almost be quantified.</p>
                <p>We had our people running around with flow charts and graphs and schedules and
                    looking at equations and looking at who will have which numbers of brigades
                    still in which places, at which dates that were the benchmarks in Res. 435, and
                    so forth.</p>
                <p>Another three day meeting. My senior military advisor, Jim Woods, who worked as
                    the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Africa, at one point said to me
                    that he had about given up on this, because we weren't getting there, we just
                    weren't quite getting there.</p>
                <p>But then all of a sudden toward the end of the meeting we got there. An idea was
                    put forward and there was a slight modification and then another idea was put
                    forward and before we knew it we had an agreed schedule that of course would be
                    the Cuban-Angolan schedule, but the South Africans had approved it, and it was
                    more or less a front loaded schedule.</p>
                <p>It was a longer schedule than the South Africans had suggested back in August but
                    a far shorter schedule than the Angolans and Cubans had initially suggested.
                    Without getting too far down in the weeds, there were variables within the
                    schedule. One variable was how many Cuban forces leave early. A second variable
                    was how many Cuban forces move north to which parallels. A third variable was
                    how long is the total withdrawal period? Is it seven months, is it four years?
                    It turned out to be thirty months, but front loaded. Another variable is how
                    many Cubans would remain (if any) on the date the South African flag came down
                    in Namibia.</p>
                <p>Anyway, by the end of that wonderful day there was a lot of huzzahs and a lot of
                    celebrations and a lot of champagne toasts and it was quite an amazing time,
                    because we had actually cracked the nut, we had solved the biggest issue, which
                    was to get an agreed schedule that put South African withdrawals and Cuban
                    withdrawals on the same page so you could see them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a practical problem and that is airlift or
                        sealift to get the Cubans out, 'cause that's not exactly a country with
                        tremendous airlift or sealift resources?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: You know what, they were very good at pointing that out, because you
                    have to close down bases, you have to gather equipment, you have to move heavy
                    equipment, you have to assure that what you're leaving behind doesn't turn to
                    scrap overnight and you have to bring in your Angolan partners to take over your
                    facilities and it's a fairly elaborate process.</p>
                <pb facs="0242" n="Page0242"/>
                <p>Part of this is politics, face and part of it is real logistics, as you're
                    suggesting and bringing home all that number of boys in a hurry was a big deal
                    for Cuba.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a ghost at the banquet sitting off there,
                        somebody who could really screw things up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Oh, yes, there were ghosts. We hadn't finished. One of the things that
                    we did at this round in November was to make sure that this rather complex
                    package stayed on track. And there was still quite a few things to do. We had a
                    schedule approved in principle but it had to be confirmed in capitals, it had to
                    be translated into a formal bilateral Cuba-Angola treaty which was acceptable to
                    South Africa, we needed to develop a tripartite agreement among the three of
                    them that would incorporate the bilateral agreement by reference, there was the
                    question of coordinating with the UN Secretariat on what we called D Day, that's
                    the day of the official start of the UN implementation plan, Resolution 435.
                    There was the question of when does the UN secretariat formally join these
                    US-mediated talks, because the UN always sent someone (typically, the special
                    representative for Namibia, Martti Ahtisaari) who was available to talk to, but
                    he wasn't in the meetings.</p>
                <p>When does the UN become part of this? When does the UN dust off this now ten year
                    old UN peace plan and begin to figure out whether every single part of it is
                    going to go forward exactly as had been negotiated in the previous period? There
                    were a bunch of those kinds of issues to be worked out, so we actually needed
                    two more rounds of negotiation that took place in Brazzaville, Congo before we
                    got to New York and actually signed everything. But we agreed the troop
                    withdrawal schedule in November. And it was at Geneva that a conversation
                    occurred which planted a seed in my mind: I think I mentioned earlier a late
                    night drink that I had in my Geneva hotel room with my Russian colleague Vasev,
                    who by this point had probably had several scotches and he remarked, “I've spent
                    my entire career trying to block everything you do, but this is really enjoyable
                    and creative! We're working together!” That exchange underscored the Russian
                    evolution toward seeing value in thinking about a cooperative approach to
                    security.</p>
                <p>The Brazzaville meetings in early December were intense, back-to-back affairs.
                    They included the usually range of high drama, practical work, serious glitches
                    over issues large and small. We discussed target dates for signing in New York,
                    D dates for UN implementation, the texts of accords including legally binding
                    treaty language which required input from four sets of lawyers, and done in
                    three languages, and so forth.</p>
                <pb facs="0243" n="Page0243"/>
                <p>We also began a delicate side conversation with the parties and the Russians
                    about possible terms of reference of a joint implementing commission, What about
                    the notion of some sort of joint commission to keep things on track? Who would
                    be part of it? Is it a good idea for the U.S. and the Soviet Union to be members
                    of it? I had to run that up the chain in the State Department and get the Legal
                    Advisor's office to chop off on that. I had a lawyer with me at all times
                    throughout the eight years, but still there needed to be a senior level chop
                    that there could be on-going U.S. membership in such an entity (as well as the
                    Russian issue). One of my biggest worries was the risk that the U.S. might get
                    distracted and not stick around to see this through. Implementation was going to
                    take a minimum of 30 months from D day.</p>
                <p>This was one of the best things that we did in this process. We made mistakes,
                    but we got a few things right and one of them was the notion that the process
                    doesn't end when everything is signed and sealed. Implementation requires
                    commitment and engagement.</p>
                <p>It seemed to us since Geneva that the way to get the Russians completely
                    committed to what they were already getting more and more involved in was to
                    have them be formal members of something, give them some sort of a formal link
                    to this. But rather than have us propose it at the table, it would better maybe
                    if they volunteered. So we went back and forth with the Russians, should we
                    propose you, or do you want to volunteer? It was a “shall we dance?” kind of
                    thing. And the Russians were intrigued by this, absolutely intrigued.</p>
                <p>Eventually we got the Russians to agree to be nominated, we would nominate them
                    and they would accept, to be members of a joint commission and that seemed to
                    make sense. But the joint commission wouldn't come into effect until the UN plan
                    began to operate and as we looked down the timetable, that would probably be
                    sometime in the early months of 1989.</p>
                <p>So we had to work out all these dates and timing and so forth. We agreed we'd go
                    to New York just before Christmas of '88 and have the final, big signing
                    ceremony with all the delegations coming at fairly senior levels, ministerial
                    level and that we would have two signing ceremonies, one between Cuba and Angola
                    and one between Cuba, Angola and South Africa. But in some ways the most
                    exciting breakthrough came with the signature on December 13 of the Brazzaville
                    Protocol. It formally accepted and reflected all that had gone on during the
                    previous 12 months, reiterated the key decisions and commitments, set December
                    22 as the date of signature in New York and April 1, 1989 as D day for the UN
                    Plan, agreed on timing for exchange of prisoners of war, established the terms
                    of reference for a Joint Commission to oversee implementation, and confirmed
                    that the UN, Angola and Cuba would work out arrangements for verification of
                    Cuban withdrawal from Angola. This last item took a lot of hard work. The
                    Angolans and Cubans 'volunteered' to arrange a UN mechanism for verification
                    (later UNAVEM), but this was hardly going to satisfy the South Africans (or the
                    U.S. for that matter). It was necessary in the end to have a side understanding
                    that confirmed Washington's readiness to use its intelligence means to monitor
                    Cuban departures (thousands of UN personnel would be monitoring the South
                    Africans in Namibia).</p>
                <pb facs="0244" n="Page0244"/>
                <p>Amazingly, there were ghosts even the night before the final signing ceremony in
                    New York. There were issues that required my senior deputy, Chas Freeman, to get
                    involved late in the evening December 21 trying to manage some bad tempers about
                    who would be in the room and what sequence would take place on details of the
                    implementation of the UN plan, various things that we thought we'd sorted out
                    but came up again on the eve of the big day.</p>
                <p>Something else that came up on the eve was Pan Am 103.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain what Pan Am 103 was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Pan Am 103 was the Pan Am flight that went down over Lockerbie, Scotland
                    on the 21st of December, which is the day before our big signing ceremony. The
                    South African delegation for the signing was to have been on that plane,
                    including two ministers and the entire negotiating team.</p>
                <p>This was a remarkable piece of fate. Less fortunate was a Swedish diplomat who'd
                    been the UN Commissioner for Namibia, a kind of UN job that didn't really get
                    involved in anything substantive, but was it sort of a symbolic gesture that the
                    UN system had created a UN Commissioner for Namibia. His name was Bernt
                    Carlsson. He was killed on Pan Am 103 and had been planning to attend the
                    ceremony.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume that the immediate assumption was this was
                        somebody trying to screw up your work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, it was Gaddafi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was Gaddafi, but I'm just thinking that the fact that
                        the South African delegation planned to be on that plane, your focus on your
                        issue, were you looking around and saying, “Who's trying to sabotage
                        this?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, we didn't have time to think about that, about any possible
                    linkage. It was just remarkable. It went through our minds.</p>
                <p>The day of December 22nd, 1988, will be etched in my memory for the rest if my
                    days as the day when all this came together in one place, and we managed to pull
                    off a fairly intricate signing ceremony in the UN's ECOSOC chamber.</p>
                <pb facs="0245" n="Page0245"/>
                <p>This is UN politics for you: this was a great UN victory. When you think about
                    it, UNTAG, which was the UN force that would implement the Namibian plan, was
                    one of the most successful UN peacekeeping operations in the UN's history and it
                    was going to be led by some very, very capable people, including Martti
                    Ahtisaari, who was going to be the UN SRSG to oversee implementation.</p>
                <p>You would have thought that the UN, led by a very able Perez de Cuellar, would
                    see fit to have this signing in the Security Council. No, these peace agreements
                    were the result of constructive engagement, this was the American diplomacy to
                    bring peace to southern Africa. And so, the regional groups that lobby around
                    the Secretariat like feral cats raised a stink about having a signing ceremony
                    in the UN Security Council for the U.S.-led negotiation bringing independence to
                    Namibia and getting the Cubans out.</p>
                <p>So that was okay, but it's typical of the UN politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in actual fact, the UN had no seat at the table
                        during the negotiations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Not formally, no. They were in the next room, or they were in the next
                    hotel. Ahtisaari was with us throughout most of these incredible number of
                    meetings. He flew sometimes in our plane, sometimes by his own means.</p>
                <p>He would come and be available to the parties, in the wings, to talk, to
                    encourage them, to see how this could all work. And he's such a skillful guy
                    that to say he wasn't at the table is technically true, but he was there in
                    every way except formally. The UN had an ear and had eyes and it had a
                    spokesperson who could coach the parties. He did some of that.</p>
                <p>So Perez de Cuellar was very well informed. He knew what was going on. But the
                    politics of the UN headquarters were such that there was an argument about where
                    to have a signing.</p>
                <p>I should just mention an interesting bit of atmosphere from the day, this was a
                    situation where the American Secretary of State was handing the UN Secretary
                    General a peace agreement ending years of regional, cross border wars in
                    southern Africa, but before he could hand them peace he had to give the
                    delegations the opportunity to speak about peace and what it meant and what they
                    had contributed.</p>
                <p>So there was an Angolan speech, then a Cuban speech, then a South African speech
                    and they almost ripped it up. They could not resist scoring points for the
                    history books and speaking to their various audiences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Shultz have any problem with sharing the platform with
                        a Cuban representative?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0246" n="Page0246"/>
                <p>CROCKER: He had to admit them into the room, otherwise we're not going to have a
                    signing. No, he had no problem with that.</p>
                <p>But the Cuban Foreign Minister - Isidoro Malmierca, who had played no role
                    whatsoever in the process - used the microphone not only to celebrate Cuba's
                    contributions to this process, but to attack American foreign policy on three
                    continents, to attack South Africa's political leadership over apartheid and
                    other sins, and generally to behave badly. South African Foreign Minister Roelof
                    ('Pik') Botha would not be outdone, and suggested that the two of the step
                    outside to settle matters.</p>
                <p>When he finally got the microphone back, Shultz said, “Well, I think we know what
                    the American negotiating team has had to deal with the past eight years.”</p>
                <p>But Shultz made very brief remarks and then just handed the treaties over to the
                    UN and then we had a big party at the American mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was signed a day or two before Christmas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yeah, three days before Christmas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had George H.W. Bush, the president-elect, put together
                        any sort of an African team in the State Department by this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: No. You know what happens in transitions is that all people who are
                    presidential appointees are asked to submit their resignations pro forma and
                    that includes ambassadors as well as assistant secretaries and so on. So there
                    was no clarity on that point.</p>
                <p>I had worked closely with Bush as Vice President during those eight years, and we
                    knew each other pretty well. His wife and my wife had enjoyed times together at
                    dinners and stuff like that. We'd visited their home up on Observatory Circle a
                    number of times..</p>
                <p>So there was good vibes there, but the real issue was how to get from December 22
                    to April 1st. April 1st was the agreed start date that we finally came up with,
                    April 1st of '89, for the UN plan.</p>
                <p>By April 1st we had to have the UN somehow either deployed or deploying and South
                    Africans confined to base in Namibia and so forth, all those provisions that are
                    in the UN plan that were quite specific.</p>
                <pb facs="0247" n="Page0247"/>
                <p>So there was an interim here of four months or so and one of the questions was
                    should I stay on for those four months, would I be asked to and would I want to
                    stay more than four months if I was asked to and would Jim Baker, who was going
                    to be the new Secretary of State, want me to stay on?</p>
                <p>So I had to think about all of that over the Christmas-New Year holidays, but
                    they also had to think about it, figure out where they were going. But those
                    months of January through April are worthy I think of another conversation..</p>
                <p>I made the decision that I did not want to stay on beyond the point of getting
                    the UN on the ground. Once the UN was on the ground this was hopefully an
                    irreversible process. If the UN didn't get deployed properly or if there hiccups
                    (and there were between January and April) God knows what would happen, and we
                    needed to have a firm hand on the steering wheel during this process.</p>
                <p>So I felt it was very important to see it through to the point of implementation,
                    but not to see it through throughout the implementation, which was thirty
                    months. I'd been doing this now for eight years!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your team? Did they immediately disperse, or
                        were you able to sort of keep together a State Department team to keep an
                        eye on what was going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: It's interesting you ask that question. Foreign Service Officers, in my
                    experience, hard to generalize, of course, but they tend to be motivated by
                    competence and the possibility of success. They're not motivated by the
                    opposites.</p>
                <p>And this was a winner, so we had no trouble attracting and keeping good people.
                    But, obviously, people have tours of duty and so you're going to have some
                    turnover in any case.</p>
                <p>But I had a very strong senior deputy in Chas Freeman and there were a number of
                    other people who were helping and doing wonderful work in the AF Bureau, at all
                    levels. (Among them who were part of these efforts over the years I would
                    particularly highlight Robert Frasure, Nancy Ely, John Byerly, Mike McKinley,
                    Dan Simpson, Robert Cabelly, John Ordway, Jeffrey Davidow, Tex Harris, Ken
                    Brown, Earl Irving, Paul Hare, Raymond Smith, Lannon Walker, Frank Wisner, Jim
                    Bishop, Jerry Gallucci, Mike Ranneberger, Charles Snyder, Mark Bellamy, Jim
                    Woods, and Hank Cohen.) Some of them were on the job in 1988-89, others at much
                    earlier stages. We had a very strong team and they stayed engaged, for the first
                    few years or so, anyway. And then things begin to move on and people get new
                    jobs and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is May 5, 2010 with Chet Crocker. Chet, talk
                        away.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0248" n="Page0248"/>
                <p>CROCKER: When I think about the various things we were doing in the African
                    region during the 1980's apart from the southern African negotiations, I break
                    it down into three or four categories of activity.</p>
                <p>I'm not going to go into country by country stuff, because that gets tedious and
                    down in the weeds, but the categories that I would identify would be first
                    trying to be more effective with our allies and working intensively with
                    allies.</p>
                <p>With the Brits it was never hard to do that, because they were eager and we were
                    eager, and we had a lot we could learn from each other and they were very good
                    at coaching us and also we used their channels in many places to get things
                    done. So we talked to the Brits all the time.</p>
                <p>I think I've discussed that and of course this was particularly in Anglophone
                    Africa. mainly on places like Kenya, East Africa and then southern Africa and to
                    some extent Nigeria with the Brits. Our intelligence sharing nicely complemented
                    the diplomatic coordination and consultation.</p>
                <p>The other allied relationship that's interesting and was critically important to
                    us is the French. The French, as we all know, looked at Africa as a very
                    important place for them.</p>
                <p>One of the reasons why they were still a great power is they saw themselves in
                    the Eighties and perhaps even do under Sarkozy is that they have this
                    cultural-political support base of some Francophone Africans who are with them
                    on a lot of issues, especially in New York in the UN, but not only in New
                    York.</p>
                <p>But by the time we get into the 1980's the French are finding that the
                    maintenance of their client-patron relationships is getting quite expensive, so
                    they're not as hostile to American involvement in their former colonial areas as
                    they used to be.</p>
                <p>At one stage they were so paranoid and defensive that you couldn't really do any
                    business talking to them, but that changed and they became more interested in
                    engaging with us, as long as we weren't there to push them out commercially.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that we seem to have relationship on was
                        in airlift. We had the planes that could move things, people around and the
                        French had the troops to be moved around. During your time, was that much of
                        a factor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I think that's true if they were doing big deployments, but the French
                    during this period still had their network of bases in Africa and so they had
                    their own forward deployed people and they had some transport aircraft that
                    could move them.</p>
                <pb facs="0249" n="Page0249"/>
                <p>I think they would have been a little bit sensitive to the idea of our flying
                    their troops into conflict zones, though. The case that was most dramatic in
                    this regard in the Eighties was Chad, where we were working with the French, and
                    it took a lot of hard work to coordinate with them on how to stop Libyan
                    adventurism in Chad.</p>
                <p>Almost every Chadian regime change has taken place with support from either
                    Darfur in Sudan, where the rebels come from, or else with Libyan support from
                    the north. So Chadian politics had long been internationalized, but we did not
                    want to see Libya controlling Chad, and nor did Chad's black African neighbors
                    such as Cameroun, Gabon, Congo-Kinshasa, Uganda. And so when the Libyans began
                    backing rebel factions using heavy armor and so forth, we sat down with the
                    French and I'm talking now the mid-1980's and we worked out a very detailed plan
                    for providing support to the legitimate government of Chad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You want to talk a little about your personal contacts and
                        dealings with the French?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Sure, it was always interesting, you'd go to Paris and I guess kind of
                    like coming to Washington you'd have to touch three or four bases to find out
                    what the hell was going on, because the French have a complicated structure and
                    back then it included the Quai d'Orsay, of course and you'd stop there and have
                    good conversations, very expert conversations.</p>
                <p>Then we would go to the Cooperation Ministry, which is where the money was, where
                    the budget was that was supporting a lot of these individual countries. And it
                    was interesting because sometimes the Cooperation Ministry people were more
                    socialist- oriented and more NGO-oriented and also skeptical about the nature of
                    these French-African political relationships, whereas the Quai was much more
                    straight-laced and proper about everything and also I think felt that they
                    didn't really run the policy, because the policy was run by the gentleman in the
                    Elysee known as “Papamadit,” who was Francois Mitterrand. Papamadit was the
                    phrase used to describe Jean-Christophe Mitterrand, the son, who ran the Africa
                    cell in the Elysee. So we talked to Jean-Christophe a lot.</p>
                <p>And we would talk to the intelligence people and exchange information and
                    analysis with the military. So there were five channels to consult with and we
                    always had a very expert Africa watcher in the embassy in Paris that would help
                    keep us briefed, so we didn't have to come in cold from Washington.</p>
                <p>So this provided a basis of expertise and a number of my colleagues would spend a
                    lot of their time in coordination with the French.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the French have the equivalent in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0250" n="Page0250"/>
                <p>CROCKER: I think they did and we of course had our own multiple channels, but I
                    think when it came to dealing with Francophone Africa this was not a high
                    priority for the CIA or for the Defense Department, for the most part.</p>
                <p>The only exception being Chad, where we did a good deal of practical and I'm
                    talking logistical and operational coordination. The French had a good deal of
                    air power available and they had some ground troops and the Chadians had an
                    under-equipped and rather ill-led armed forces, but we provided a lot of
                    hardware to them. And eventually the Chadians, with French help and some of our
                    help in both overt and not so overt channels, the Chadians cleaned the clocks of
                    the Libyans. Our side of this effort was stitched together brilliantly by my
                    deputy Jim Bishop and his DOD counterpart Jim Woods, working also with Agency
                    counterparts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the “Toyota War,” wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yeah, the Toyota War, yes, exactly. It sounds a little bit light hearted
                    and a little bit Beau Gesteish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a significant tactical way of dealing with a
                        heavily armored Libyan force.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: It was, indeed. You took the words out of my mouth. It was a very proud
                    moment. Hissene Habr�, who's now of course under a dark cloud for human rights
                    violations and all kinds of awful things that no doubt he had a role in but he
                    was one gutsy, capable desert warrior and he waged a good campaign against the
                    Libyans. He was really in the lead, but a lot of French support and U.S.
                    support.</p>
                <p>So allied coordination was important and we took seriously the notion in the
                    Eighties that we didn't have all the answers or all the resources, so we would
                    talk very regularly to those two allies, but also with Germans, with Canadians,
                    with Japanese. The Portuguese, of course, especially for southern Africa. And
                    the list went on.</p>
                <p>So I just want to emphasize that theme of working with allies and not imagining
                    that somehow Americans had the answers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's been a major change and I don't know where it took
                        place, with not just our government but other governments, with the role of
                        the non-governmental organizations, NGOs. There was a time when they were
                        considered sort of interfering do-gooders and, yes, you could use them. You
                        mentioned the French, at least the Quai d'Orsay had sort of this
                        feeling.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>But we've learned that these organizations are now an arrow in our foreign policy
                    quiver.</p>
                <pb facs="0251" n="Page0251"/>
                <p>CROCKER: I don't know if we really realized at the time the extent to which that
                    could be true, at the time being the 1980's. Of course, what's happened since
                    the end of the Cold War is that the barriers to entry for NGOs have collapsed
                    and so they're everywhere and there are all different kinds, in many different
                    fields, as you know.</p>
                <p>Back then the main sign of the NGOs would be religious and secular humanitarian
                    groups, like World Vision and Save the Children, for example and we saw a lot of
                    them and they played a key role in bringing relief in areas of humanitarian
                    crisis.</p>
                <p>And there were others who were operating, but we probably had less contact with
                    them, or at least I did. There were some conflict resolution and mediation types
                    on the edge of our activity and we saw the Dartmouth Process, which was then run
                    by the Kettering Foundation, I believe, Hal Saunders and people working with
                    Hal, engaged in U.S.-Soviet Track II dialog efforts, and we became aware of that
                    and we welcomed briefings and we would brief them in turn. They were talking to
                    Soviet academics in parallel while we were talking to Soviet officials. So there
                    was some of that.</p>
                <p>Another major sector of our activity in the 1980's I would describe as basically
                    economic engagement and economic dialogue. This was a massive effort (often
                    jointly with allies) to encourage Africans down the road of policy reform,
                    reducing the role of government in the economy, liberalizing exchange rates and
                    trade, reducing subsidies, opening markets and that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>It's a huge topic and it was a feature in virtually all of our relationships with
                    African countries; there was an important economic policy discussion taking
                    place and so I had to learn about development economics and I had to listen to
                    colleagues who were well briefed on it in order to understand what was on the
                    minds and the priority lists of a lot of our African friends.</p>
                <p>They'd come to Washington or I'd go to their capitals and they'd want to talk
                    about foreign assistance and whether we would help them address their endless
                    'financing gaps' (code language for dealing with debt arrears and budget woes),
                    they'd want to talk about what the IMF and World Bank were doing to them under
                    the rubric of 'structural adjustment programs'..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the ghost of the London School of Economics still
                        weighing heavily over particularly Anglophone Africa? You know what I mean,
                        the socialists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Sure and it wasn't just British academics, it was also Scandinavian ones
                    who were very heavily engaged and for a while still believing in the old Fabian
                    socialist and similar parallel doctrines. So there was a lot of doctrinal
                    baggage out there.</p>
                <pb facs="0252" n="Page0252"/>
                <p>I think the Africans are very pragmatic about their situation, and if they saw
                    there was an alternative road that they could consider walking down, they were
                    prepared to look at it.</p>
                <p>But they needed to know there'd be someone at their side, in a sense, if they
                    went down a path that was somewhat different. They need to know that the IMF and
                    the World Bank would support them and that we would support them in the Bank and
                    the Fund, that's basically what it boiled down to.</p>
                <p>So we're talking about aid conditionality and the policies associated with the
                    so-called Washington consensus. All these things were front and center in our
                    African policies during the 1980's, an important component, whether we're
                    talking about troubled friends like Liberia and Zaire, as they were very
                    troubled then and remained troubled for a long time afterwards, or countries
                    that were somewhat easier to talk to, like Zambia or Ghana.</p>
                <p>And we had progress in some of these economic dialogues and we saw real
                    breakthroughs. In other cases, we felt like we were chasing our tail and there
                    really wasn't enough in it for the local head of state to consider taking the
                    risk of going more in the direction of liberalizing his economy.</p>
                <p>Africa's economies, still, today, to some extent, but back then especially, were
                    very heavily controlled by government and very closed even to their neighbors
                    for trade, so that it was very hard for foreign investors to see a major magnet
                    or pole of attraction because there were so many tiny, balkanized economies.</p>
                <p>That's changed a lot in the last 25 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Most of their economies are based on some form of sort of
                        extractive activity, sending it out, but not much on trade.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, the great story that's really taken place since the Nineties is
                    the opening up of consumer production. It's focused much more on things like
                    cell phones and radios. FM radio is a big deal in Africa today. Light
                    manufacture, textiles and all kinds of clothing and shoes, beverages and
                    personal products of all kinds.</p>
                <p>Africa's growing today in a way that was almost inconceivable back in the 1980's,
                    so there's been a lot of change.</p>
                <p>I would like to believe that we - specially key colleagues like Princeton Lyman,
                    Eleanor Constable, Roy Stacy, Peter McPherson, Bob Pringle and others working
                    the economic issues sowed the seeds for this shift in economic doctrine back in
                    the 1980's. But it took a long time for it to really mature and produce
                    results.</p>
                <pb facs="0253" n="Page0253"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of in your mind and those who were in Crocker's
                        circle, did you really see that Africa could really come out, you might say,
                        come out of it and become self-sustaining?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Not unless we could get the wars stopped, which is why the priority was
                    on conflict resolution, conflict management, mediation and so forth. There's no
                    way that you could expect people to be able to work towards a more open
                    political and economic system if they've got militarized conflict on their
                    borders or inside their territory.</p>
                <p>So that was the way we looked at it and I think it's been borne out by history.
                    Those parts of Africa that have stopped their wars are actually doing quite well
                    today. The parts that are still in wars are just about to fall off the edge of
                    the earth. I'm talking about places like Chad, Darfur/Sudan, the DRC, and the
                    Central African Republic</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the Horn of Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: And part of the Horn, yes. It's a huge, night and day, difference
                    between better governed and worse governed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did the Horn hit you at the time, our
                        concerns?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: We had, I'd say, at least two major concerns. So much time has passed, I
                    have to ignore all that's taken place more recently and go back to that
                    period.</p>
                <p>Item number one was that there was in Sudan a government friendly to the Middle
                    East peace process and supported</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Recognized Camp David.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Recognized Camp David and had supported the courageous Egyptian
                    decisions at Camp David. We're talking now about the government of Gaafar
                    Nimeiri, which lasted for a while, but eventually Nimeiri lost his way and began
                    drinking the Islamist Kool-aid.</p>
                <p>And then he got overthrown and Sudan had a military government and a not very
                    effective civilian government and then these guys, Omar Bashir and his
                    colleagues, took over in the late 1980's.</p>
                <pb facs="0254" n="Page0254"/>
                <p>So Sudan was an important client, an important friend, for Middle East policy
                    reasons, but as its leadership began to go down the wrong road on domestic
                    politics, it began listening more and more to the Islamist voice, it was tearing
                    apart its own national unity, in a sense and it became a more and more troubled
                    partner.</p>
                <p>By the time I left the State Department we were seeing the beginnings of the real
                    Islamization of Sudanese politics and it was very worrisome. And also there were
                    huge humanitarian issues and problems getting food to people in outlying areas
                    of the country where local militias (often supported by Khartoum) and local
                    disputes disrupted any semblance of normal life.</p>
                <p>So Sudan was a major preoccupation for us. The other, parallel, preoccupation was
                    Soviet-dominated Ethiopia, next door. We tried repeatedly to engage with
                    Mengistu of Ethiopia and to offer the Ethiopians, as we had the Mozambicans,
                    Angolans and others of Marxist orientation, an alternative to relying on Moscow
                    and being closely tied to Moscow.</p>
                <p>Every time we got close to a real effective set of meetings with the Mengistu
                    regime something would happen and meetings would get cancelled and we concluded
                    that they were cancelled in Moscow.</p>
                <p>I once tested that by talking to the head of that section of the International
                    Department of the CPSU, this was in 1988 and I said to him, “Why is it that you
                    guys are so opposed to us having conversations? We have many friends in
                    Ethiopia. It's been a strong relationship for decades. You seem to want to
                    prevent a U.S.-Ethiopian dialogue from taking place. What is the problem?”</p>
                <p>He looked at me and said, “You want everything, you Americans, you want
                    everything. You want southern Africa and now you want the Horn of Africa. Why
                    don't you leave things alone?” He was very frank.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course that was the last outpost, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: They felt like they were being pushed out of Afghanistan, we had signs
                    of a peace process in Central America, a lot of positive things were happening
                    in Angola, and in Mozambique the Soviets were no longer getting much joy in that
                    relationship.</p>
                <p>People often kid and joke about whether or not we exaggerated Russian influence
                    and I'm sure there were times when we did and we distorted our priorities to
                    some extent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is true in every phase of foreign affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0255" n="Page0255"/>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes. But Ethiopia was a case, a concrete case, where everything should
                    have worked for some kind of a thaw or a detente in our relationship, excepting
                    that Big Brother didn't want it to and Big Brother had them by the short hairs,
                    if I can be coarse here, Big Brother had them dependent on military assistance,
                    huge debts, lots of civilian sector loans and so on and they were not really
                    free agents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left, what was sort of on the right course, it
                        may take work, but on the right course and where were there going to be
                        continuing troubles?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, the Horn, as we were just talking, is an area of real concern and
                    I know my colleagues who served out in Somalia were also very worried because
                    they could see that Siad Barre was not good for the Somali people or for the
                    region.</p>
                <p>He was very troubled and his regime was getting more and more narrowly based and
                    relying more and more on his Marehan clan, at the expense of other clans of
                    Somalis.</p>
                <p>And we had fairly active embassies that were trying to keep this from going off
                    the track, but it was a holding action and we were worried about it. I don't
                    want to read back retrospectively and rewrite history here, but I think by the
                    time you got to '89, '90 it was pretty far gone in Somalia.</p>
                <p>We had difficulty with that relationship and Siad Barre, as he would quickly
                    confess, was not a paragon of human rights leadership. He joked about it. I'd go
                    see him and he said, “I know you're coming to talk about human rights issues and
                    about opening up my political system and doing the things that you Americans
                    would like to see us do.</p>
                <p>“Let me tell you. I live in a rough neighborhood. I've got these awful Ethiopians
                    next door.” And then he would stop and he would say, “Somalis are not Americans.
                    You need a strong hand out here. And, by the way, I'm no Abe Lincoln,” he said
                    to me once. So we knew we didn't have an Abe Lincoln on our hands. It was a very
                    worrisome place.</p>
                <p>But even more worrisome was our inability to get the Sudanese to stop trying to
                    impose Sharia law on the South, to stop tearing their own country apart. .</p>
                <p>We tried to shift Nimeiri's course, we tried to work with his successor, a
                    general named Suwar al-Dahab, who came into office in the mid-Eighties, we tried
                    it with Sadiq al-Mahdi, who I always thought was a person one could have worked
                    with and he was in office from 1986 to 1989, right before Bashir came in.</p>
                <pb facs="0256" n="Page0256"/>
                <p>For some reason, Sadiq just never got traction politically in Sudan and he lost
                    control of the Islamist dialogue and the Islamist aspect of his domestic policy,
                    so that he was outmaneuvered and he lost power. This was disappointing to me. He
                    was the leader of the important Umma party and had a proud lineage as the great
                    grandson of the Mahdi who fought against the British and Egyptians in the 19th
                    century, but he failed to master the scene.</p>
                <p>It's been downhill since then. We've seen the results over the last twenty plus
                    years in Sudan. To be frank, this is a part of Africa that's been hard for
                    anyone to get a handle on, back in the Eighties and since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view Islam, from your perspective, at that
                        time, or were we really looking at Islam, trying to figure what the hell was
                        going on there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: It's a very good question. Where we'd run into it was when we would go
                    to black African countries, sub-Saharan African countries and we would be
                    talking to our interlocutors in places like Kenya and Uganda and DRC-Congo and
                    Senegal and C�te d'Ivoire.</p>
                <p>We'd talk to leaders in those countries and they would begin to volunteer to us
                    that there was an Islamic threat, that they were facing pressure and maybe
                    subversive influence from the north.</p>
                <p>And you'd sort of peel that back and you'd ask them, “What exactly are you
                    talking about?”</p>
                <p>They'd say, “Well, they come to town with a lot of money and they reach out and
                    they build relationships with our young people and offer lots of free goodies.
                    They're being subversive.”</p>
                <p>So we would ask, “Well, who is 'they'?”</p>
                <p>“Well, it's Egyptians, it's Libyans, it's Algerians, it's from the Gulf, it's
                    Moroccans, it's Saudis, it's Omanis.”</p>
                <p>“Well, are they all on the same page? Is this a single monolithic problem that
                    you're facing?”</p>
                <p>And then it would get very fuzzy and you'd realize that those were very different
                    vectors of Islam coming down from the north and the northeast, there was no
                    unified Islamic game back then.</p>
                <p>What's changed today, of course, is that there's a greater concern about the
                    possibility of a unified Islamist game and today we have allies within the world
                    of Islam who are also very worried about that prospect.</p>
                <pb facs="0257" n="Page0257"/>
                <p>So the United States today is able to work with Algerians and then to some extent
                    Egyptians, Sudanese and Moroccans to try and counter the worst kind of radical
                    Salafist Islam.</p>
                <p>Anyway, if you look at the map, there's a whole lot of Muslims in Africa,
                    probably close to half the continent. Maybe forty per cent of the continent
                    would be Muslim believers of one kind or another.</p>
                <p>Of course, this is not to say that they're all Islamists, but there are some
                    areas where radical Islamist doctrines have made some headway.</p>
                <p>But back in the 1980's, we didn't bring up this subject, our African friends
                    brought it up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you reach into the State Department personnel pool
                        and say, “I need an African specialist on Islam” or something and get
                        somebody, or was there even the possibility of having such specialists
                        because it was so bloody complicated and so sort of amorphous?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: What I would rely on, more than looking at some expertise pool in INR,
                    let's say, I would look at our most savvy veteran diplomats who knew this patch
                    well, people like David Shinn, Robert Oakley, Hume Horan, who were, as far as I
                    was concerned, they were walking encyclopedias, when it came to the world of
                    Islam in Africa, because they'd served in these areas and they knew them
                    well.</p>
                <p>The career service had a lot of expertise on Islam, people like Paul Hare and
                    Frank Wisner and others. They had expertise from having served there. They were
                    my think tank.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In general, it has the advantage of talking to people who
                        had to deal with the problems, rather than to making these elaborate
                        doughnuts which they cast out or whatever you want to call it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: This was the pre-Islamist peril time that we're talking about and the
                    only people who talked Islamist peril back then were certain Francophone leaders
                    and occasionally Anglophones like Daniel arap Moi in Kenya, who was very worried
                    about Islamic intervention in Africa.</p>
                <p>And I suspect they were coached a little bit by some hard line French in Paris,
                    who were also worried about it..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you have the French who were worried and rightly
                        worried, but did we find that we tended to discount French concerns?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0258" n="Page0258"/>
                <p>CROCKER: We would always pour some additional hot water in the cup when we heard
                    these kinds of messages and there were some places where there was just still a
                    longstanding rivalry and you could sense it, like Gabon, which was a jewel in
                    the French crown and a place where they made a lot of money and raised a lot of
                    political money for French metropolitan elections.</p>
                <p>Also in Zaire (DRC), we knew whenever we came to town that as soon as we left the
                    French would be there to spread a different message to Mobutu.</p>
                <p>You asked what we thought about towards the end of the Eighties and what we were
                    concerned about, in terms of prospects for Africa. Of course Zaire was a
                    troubled, sick country and it became very clear soon after the Cold War ended,
                    in the early Nineties, that Zaire was going to crumble and perhaps fall
                    apart.</p>
                <p>It was held together with scotch tape and paper clips, in a sense, by a very odd
                    regime and when Mobutu began to lose his way and lose his support, external as
                    well as domestic, it just imploded and created a disaster in Central Africa that
                    still afflicts the region 15 years later.</p>
                <p>So we had some difficult clients, some troubled clients, really troubled ones and
                    the only reason we continued to work with them was because we didn't know what
                    to replace them with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Towards the end, obviously the Middle East, no matter what
                        happens, sort of sucks the blood out of any administration, this is where
                        the action is. Did you find pretty good support, understanding, from
                        secretaries of state and all that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: You're now asking me a very different kind of question. I had the very
                    good fortune to have an outstanding, world-class statesman, in George Shultz, as
                    my boss and he had good people around him, too, that provided excellent support.
                    It wasn't always with the Secretary himself.</p>
                <p>I'm not sure I would have stuck it out without Shultz having been there, because
                    he gave me a long leash and he gave me great air cover and he organized for the
                    president, on occasion, to give me air cover when I needed it.</p>
                <p>I got the attention I needed. That's one of the nice things about being an
                    assistant secretary for Africa, you don't have daily interference from the
                    Seventh Floor in all the things that you're doing and you don't have 7 different
                    senior voices around town all thinking they run policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you didn't have the equivalent to an Israeli or Greek
                        lobby getting at you all the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0259" n="Page0259"/>
                <p>CROCKER: No. We did have a lot of that on southern African issues sometimes, as
                    we've talked about, but that was different. We had some of that, but in general
                    we had more running room, if you like and if something really awful began to
                    happen in a country we'd set up a task force and we'd get support from the
                    Seventh Floor and we'd try to manage as best we could.</p>
                <p>But the area where we had the most difficulty I'd say in terms of getting support
                    from the building and from other parts of the Executive Branch was when it came
                    to resources for foreign assistance, to top up our levels of economic support so
                    that we could do more with our African partners, to give them more evidence, if
                    they would take any steps we could support them more, that kind of conditional
                    message.</p>
                <p>And we launched a few economic initiatives in the mid- and late Eighties which I
                    had to fight hard for and my colleagues, people like Princeton Lyman and others,
                    worked nonstop to try and get more support from the Seventh Floor.</p>
                <p>This was a struggle every year, the budget. But I will say, looking back, by the
                    mid-Eighties, I'm thinking '86, '87, we had pretty decent levels of economic
                    assistance for Africa. We won some of those battles.</p>
                <p>And it wasn't until the G.W. Bush Administration that the absolute levels began
                    to go up again. But between the mid-Eighties and the late Nineties there was
                    actually a relative decline in budget support for Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One hears the story that if you give money for economic
                        assistance somewhere in the Third World, that the recipients would always
                        take off their ten per cent or twenty per cent or something, corruption and
                        all, but when you got to Africa, that figure was around ninety to a hundred
                        per cent or something. Africa was really bad mouthed by people who looked at
                        corruption. But how did you see it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, there were two different kinds of programs that we had that were
                    aimed at dealing with these problems and promoting development generally.</p>
                <p>We had DA, or development assistance, which was more project based and in a
                    project you have AID people and AID contractors very much involved, both in the
                    negotiation and implementation of a project. So you could actually track the
                    extent to which you were getting some result. You could see what was
                    happening.</p>
                <p>And there I'd say the weak link always was implementation and maintenance. You'd
                    get something started, but would the local government actually take ownership of
                    it and keep it going after the money stopped flowing? So that was the big
                    headache.</p>
                <pb facs="0260" n="Page0260"/>
                <p>The other kind of program is what we called program lending, where you're
                    providing essentially budget support and that was the trickiest, because you
                    don't know the extent to which money is fungible.</p>
                <p>You put money in one place to support a positive activity, like for example
                    privatizing the transportation network, you don't know if that's going to show
                    up somewhere else where they've in effect diverted the funding that you've
                    provided in order to buy something that you didn't want them to buy, like
                    armored cars or something of that kind.</p>
                <p>And of course whenever there's a purchase element to an assistance program
                    there's an opportunity for gatekeepers to put whatever it is, ten per cent or
                    eighty per cent, in their pocket. And getting control of procurement is the
                    biggest problem in Africa. Procurement is the place where corruption takes
                    place, when you're purchasing something.</p>
                <p>I wouldn't describe it as ninety per cent, but I would say that we had problems
                    of this kind in almost every African relationship. And of course we were dealing
                    in the Cold War era. You couldn't make anti-corruption your number one priority
                    if you were also trying to maintain relationships that were privileged
                    relationships in a Cold War sense.</p>
                <p>You couldn't be an alliance leader and a Cold War leader and a UN-based
                    superpower if you were going to make anti-corruption your number one issue.
                    You'd lose customers quickly if that was your number one issue. I think you get
                    my drift.</p>
                <p>So everything had to be balanced out: human rights, anti-corruption, calling for
                    regular elections, opening up the political system, dealing with economic
                    management, also dealing with conflict issues and providing support on regional
                    conflict agendas.</p>
                <p>So we had lots of different priorities that we had to weigh.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have a conscious policy of trying to keep
                        sophisticated military hardware out of Africa, as we did with Latin
                        America?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yeah, we did and I think we generally succeeded, in part because they
                    didn't have the money, for the most part, to buy fancy stuff. So there were very
                    few serious military assistance programs in Africa.</p>
                <p>They tended to be in places where governments were very military oriented and had
                    real, as they saw it, domestic security challenges, or even cross- border
                    challenges, like Somalia facing the Ethiopians.</p>
                <pb facs="0261" n="Page0261"/>
                <p>The Ethiopians vastly outgunned the Somalis. We would feel under pressure to
                    provide some support, limited support, for things like, again, armored cars,
                    some light fighting vehicles, communications equipment, that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>But fancy stuff, very little of that. The Sudanese got an occasional airplane or
                    two from the United States and from other places. But we didn't provide a lot
                    fancy stuff. We didn't have the budget for it if they didn't have the budget for
                    it.</p>
                <p>The fancy stuff coming into Africa throughout the Cold War period, or at least
                    the expensive stuff, was overwhelmingly from the Soviets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's gathering rust somewhere now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: It is, yeah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time you were in Washington, how were your
                        relations with Africanists in academia? Obviously you were attracting spears
                        and arrows over your policy of constructive engagement, but, basically, was
                        there a growing African community of knowledge?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, for many years the African Studies Association has been the main
                    scholarly body for Africanists, and I would occasionally attend its meetings
                    when they took place in a convenient location.</p>
                <p>I stopped doing that when, as you said, slings and arrows, when the abuse got to
                    be ridiculous and I realized that what I was dealing with was just a kind of a
                    know-nothing claque that was interested in ideological warfare rather than
                    practical foreign policy.</p>
                <p>I think it's fair to say that there's a very limited interest in practical
                    foreign policy in most of these regional studies associations and the ASA was no
                    different from, let's say, the Latin American equivalent.</p>
                <p>So I stopped going to ASA meetings in the mid-1980's. I went to one or two of
                    them after I left office and I found the atmosphere still to be sufficiently
                    poisonous that it really wasn't particularly worth my time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were they coming from, the poisoners?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0262" n="Page0262"/>
                <p>CROCKER: The conspiratorial poisoners believed that our basic agenda was to be a
                    friend of white South Africa, when in fact we did more to complicate the minds
                    of white South Africa than any administration in our post-World War II
                    period.</p>
                <p>They just didn't understand the subtlety of our policy, they didn't understand
                    that we were working sequentially to create the conditions on the ground in the
                    region that would make possible a transition to free and fair elections, the
                    release of Mandela, the unbanning of the ANC and so forth.</p>
                <p>You'd have to slowly and carefully explain to these people that in fact it wasn't
                    an accident that after Namibia and Angola were settled that F.W. de Klerk
                    unbanned the ANC and released Mandela. It wasn't an accident the sequence
                    happened that way. But most academics have no acquaintance with the way foreign
                    policy actually operates. The word 'constraint' is not in the lexicon; the
                    notion of trade-offs and sequences and respecting another side's political
                    requirements - these things were not part of IR theory.</p>
                <p>So I think it was a losing debate from the standpoint of persuading the academics
                    on those sorts of issues. And also I think many of them were genuinely resistant
                    to the notion that there was any Soviet (or Cuban) problem in Africa. Well, by
                    the time we were done with it there wasn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, too, you were dealing with a particularly
                        difficult academic group. These were the people who had fought the battle,
                        usually on campus, not anywhere else, against the Vietnam policy and many of
                        the people who went into the academic world kept staying in school in order
                        to avoid the draft. I'm not denigrating them too much, but to a certain
                        extent, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, if what you're saying is that there was a generational issue, I'm
                    with you. There was a kind of Sixties flower children quality. I don't want to
                    overdo this or imply there was some sort of axis of ideological evil. Frankly,
                    some of these folks had very good relationships with people in the career
                    service that they knew who were experts on, let's say Uganda, or on Ghana or on
                    Burkina Faso or what have you and that's fine.</p>
                <p>If you're an Africanist because you're interested in the comparative politics of
                    West Africa, that's great, that's fine, I'm with you. I like the comparative
                    politics of West Africa, too.</p>
                <p>My job wasn't was to get deeply enmeshed in the comparative politics of West
                    Africa, it was too advance the U.S. national interest in West Africa and those
                    interests were limited, but they were clear. We thought we knew what they were
                    and we tried to advance them. It's a different set of focuses and
                    priorities.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0263" n="Page0263"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the focus is, the difference is still, I am not in the
                        business anymore, but I think quite profound between the practitioners and
                        theorists or the teachers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well there are different kinds of teachers. Let me put it this way, when
                    I came to Georgetown in '89 I had seen and done mediation and it had worked. I'd
                    learned a lot from it and I thought, “Well, I've done it in practice, let's see
                    if I can find a way to do it in theory,” meaning I wanted to educate myself in
                    what the academic scholarly literature on mediation and conflict resolution,
                    conflict management, was all about.</p>
                <p>And there was a very substantial field of knowledge and expertise which I enjoyed
                    getting to know, and I'm still enjoying getting to know it today, 20 years
                    later!.</p>
                <p>But that wasn't where most of the Africanists were. They were very few, there was
                    a handful of outstanding exemplars who are exceptions to what I've just
                    said.</p>
                <p>But for the most part, Africanists are rooted in fields like sociology,
                    anthropology, political science, comparative politics, ethnographic studies of
                    different kinds, gender studies of different kinds, linguistic studies, cultural
                    studies, cross-cultural studies.</p>
                <p>Those fields are less relevant to the conduct of foreign policy. But the people
                    doing work on foreign policy case studies and the role of different countries in
                    their African policies, that was very relevant. I tried to stay in touch with
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In dealing with foreign policy, I've talked to people who
                        served in Indonesia and dealt with the period of Sukarno, Suharto and you
                        can't talk to them without Cornell coming up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Cornell was apparently very influential as far as you might say anti-U.S.
                    governmental policy, really Sukarno supporting academics and everything that
                    went wrong was due to our plots.</p>
                <p>Was there any sort of either poisoned well among Africanist academics?</p>
                <p>CROCKER: Oh, I'd say sure. You had people who were disaffected expat Zairois at
                    Howard University. You had people that were very disaffected from everything to
                    do with South Africa, southern Africa, Zimbabwe, Rhodesia at the University of
                    Indiana, which had a very strong African studies program, but they also had
                    people affiliated who wrote reams and reams of stuff about how evil we were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This applies to any part of the world, among
                        academics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Sure, it goes with the terrain.</p>
                <pb facs="0264" n="Page0264"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember talking to an Israeli consular officer in
                        Chicago who said that they had not realized how many assistant professors
                        from Palestine and other places were spread throughout our academic world
                        who were giving him a lot of trouble.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Well, there's thousands of expats in the African field and many of them
                    are first class because so many African universities have been badly dealt with
                    by their governments that there's no budget and no support for research and so
                    on. So the good people leave their home countries.</p>
                <p>It's sad, but a lot of the very best academic minds in Africa have left for the
                    UK or U.S. or France or elsewhere. I don't mean to imply that it's total, but
                    it's a bit like a vacuum cleaner: if somebody wants to strengthen their African
                    studies program, they put up an opening, probably two thirds of the people
                    applying are going to be African expats. And some of them do great work and so
                    on, I'm not knocking that, but what it leads to is a sort of hollowing out of
                    the universities in Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This really does point to a problem for the future and
                        that is you might say universities are very significant parts of the
                        infrastructure of any country and if they're not getting proper money or
                        being used for political purposes and the best and brightest are fleeing,
                        then you're weakening the country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: You are and there's got to be a way to bring the fantastic, rich
                    resource of the African diaspora back to Africa and if you can't do it
                    physically, you've got to do it virtually.</p>
                <p>That's true not only in the academic field, but in the medical field. There's a
                    famous one-liner that there's more Sierra Leonean doctors in Chicago than there
                    are in Sierra Leone. That's a problem. It's true in health, it's true in a lot
                    of fields.</p>
                <p>But I think there's also some degree of diaspora recognition of a responsibility
                    and a connection, which hopefully will strengthen and will lead to a reverse
                    flow in due course in countries that are on their feet again and you see that a
                    bit in some countries.</p>
                <p>I want to go back a little bit to the lessons learned aspect if I could of this
                    whole experience of being for eight and a half years I think the longest serving
                    regional assistant secretary in the history of the building, what does one take
                    away from that?</p>
                <p>One thing I took away from it was that the people in the Foreign Service
                    represent a fantastic resource, if motivated, mobilized and coherently organized
                    to get something done.</p>
                <pb facs="0265" n="Page0265"/>
                <p>And one thing that we would never be accused of I think was that we didn't try to
                    get anything done. We tried to get a lot of things done and we succeeded, in
                    some cases.</p>
                <p>I've often been asked since that time, including by folks who worked with
                    Secretary Baker when they came in replacing Secretary Shultz, they would come
                    knocking at the door and say, “How did you work it? How did you work with the
                    career service? How come your bureau worked well and you only had two political
                    appointees in the bureau? How'd that work?”</p>
                <p>Well, I think there's two answers, maybe three answers. One is that if you treat
                    people as if they are trustworthy and you listen to them, they're more likely to
                    be trustworthy and worth listening to. It sounds pretty basic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Many political appointees come in highly suspicious.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: Yes, they've been told to be suspicious and when administrations
                    politicize the Service or some part of the Service, then there's a reaction and
                    there's a pendulum swing, and some people are considered to have been too close
                    to the previous administration and so on.</p>
                <p>I tried to avoid that, but it was a battle, especially in the early years,
                    because I inherited a bureau that was heavily staffed with people who were
                    identified with the Carter Administration and I fought to keep my senior deputy,
                    who was inherited, kept him for over a year.</p>
                <p>And when the long knives were out in my confirmation battle they wanted to get
                    rid of my senior deputy, they wanted to replace him with someone that they would
                    impose, some political appointee from one of the Senate offices.</p>
                <p>And I said back then to Al Haig, “If that's the price of my getting the job, you
                    can have the job. I don't want it. I want people that I have chosen.”</p>
                <p>Now you can't always get your way on everything in personnel, but if it's going
                    to be that kind of politicizing of one's office, then you're no longer in charge
                    of your office. I intended to be in charge of my office.</p>
                <p>So I kept good career people and then when the came for them to go I got good
                    career people to succeed them and serve as office directors and deputies. I had,
                    most of the time, four deputies in the bureau, which is a lot.</p>
                <p>One of them was political and that was basically a deputy who served the function
                    of outreach to the business community and to the African-American community, but
                    the other three were career people.</p>
                <pb facs="0266" n="Page0266"/>
                <p>And of course all the office directors were career. I had a special assistant who
                    was a political appointee and that was it.</p>
                <p>So one of the takeaways for me is that I don't care if you do a detailed analysis
                    of the political affiliations of FSOs. I've no doubt that if you did that that
                    there'd be a substantial majority who were not supporters of the GOP.</p>
                <p>But more than anything, what they were supporters of was competence and getting
                    the job done and doing something to advance the national interest. It wasn't
                    about party politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, for example, I don't think there's been any
                        president more partisan than George W. Bush, yet I get some very strong
                        statements from FSOs who I've interviewed about how George W. Bush did more
                        for Africa than most other presidents. And there's a lot of support for
                        Richard Nixon. He knew his brief.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: I think what you're describing is a kind of professional mentality, as
                    distinguished from a party political mentality. I think that's right. And so you
                    look at it and you say, “Well, who was effective in dealing with a region like
                    Africa?”</p>
                <p>George H.W. Bush was also very effective in Africa. G.W. Bush did a hell of a
                    lot, in terms of new program initiatives and raising foreign assistance and all
                    the rest. His attention span was limited, because he was doing other things, but
                    selectively he got some things done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One other aspect of this, not really a lesson learned, but
                        what happened to you when you came out of office? You get into the academic
                        world again. Were you a pariah for a while? Did you have to sort of earn
                        your bones again or something, or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: That wasn't really a problem for me. The big issue for me was suddenly
                    going cold turkey from having a bureau of 240 or whatever it is and 46 embassies
                    out there and a front office with fantastic executive support, personal
                    assistants is the right term, going from that to zip.</p>
                <p>That was actually quite an interesting transition to make and it was very healthy
                    for me. I learned how to fend for myself, learned about computers, information
                    technology and things like that!</p>
                <p>But I was doing a bunch of different things. I didn't have time to think about
                    what you're referring to, because I wasn't relying primarily on a university
                    income stream or a university affiliation for my livelihood.</p>
                <pb facs="0267" n="Page0267"/>
                <p>I was re-establishing my consulting practice, I was going on boards and I was
                    getting involved with the U.S Institute of Peace. I went on their board in 1991
                    and became chairman of their board in '92 and was chairman for the next twelve
                    years.</p>
                <p>So a lot of my professional activity was in fact linked to the Peace Institute
                    and from that I did writing and research that fed right into my teaching here.
                    So it was a good mix.</p>
                <p>Frankly, Georgetown is a good place for an academic like me, because there's a
                    tolerance factor. It's not a politically correct straightjacket, let me put it
                    that way.</p>
                <p>If I was teaching in the English Department it might be different, but not in the
                    Foreign Service School, which is a much more practitioner-oriented place, with a
                    lot of adjunct faculty teaching interesting stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: People who'd been in the business.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: We were practitioner scholars, so there wasn't that issue. It worked
                    well.</p>
                <p>I want to go back to my time in the Department, though, for a minute, because
                    some people have occasionally asked, “Why did you stay in that job so long?”
                    Part of the answer was that I had a job to do and I wanted to finish it, very,
                    very, very much, and I got a chance to finish it. That's unusual, but I saw that
                    gleam, that light at the end of the tunnel, that maybe we could get this done.
                    So there was that.</p>
                <p>Secondly, I really enjoyed the people and when people would say to me afterwards,
                    “What do you miss? Would you ever want to go back?” I miss the people. I didn't
                    miss the working environment. I didn't miss the budget preparation process or
                    the congressional testimony process, getting ready for hearings. But the people
                    relationships were very intense and very important. And so there was that.</p>
                <p>But I think the third factor was my boss, George Shultz. He made it possible to
                    stay doing that. And for a lesser man or woman who was more political, less
                    principled, less courageous, less substantive I think I would have walked, just
                    because it got old at a certain point and you take a lot of slings and
                    arrows.</p>
                <p>There was a financial cost, as well. Before I went into government I had a
                    consulting practice and you get impoverished when you're a hundred per cent in
                    the Executive Branch. So my wife went to law school to try and keep us afloat
                    financially and keep our kids in school, that kind of thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0268" n="Page0268"/>
                <p>And I've stayed very close with him. Shultz is a very special guy. And as I had
                    he had good people, like John Whitehead and Larry Eagleburger, Mike Armacost,
                    good colleagues around, as well. So that was a worthwhile environment.</p>
                <p>One other thing I wanted to mention about lessons learned: we ran the bureau kind
                    of like a team. It wasn't a top down authoritarian environment. We had a
                    team.</p>
                <p>The Foreign Service is a very rank-oriented place. We would have meetings in my
                    office to talk about what are we going to do with Samuel Doe in Liberia, who was
                    a constant headache and a difficult relationship and there'd be myself and maybe
                    one or two deputies and an office director and a desk officer, maybe somebody
                    from the political-military shop that we had, or the economic policy shop.</p>
                <p>I'd try to get the conversation going, but I wasn't interested in having this
                    discussion run by the ranking people in the room. I wanted to hear what people
                    had to say. And so we tried to run it kind of like you might run a graduate
                    seminar, in the sense of getting people to talk, and initially I found there was
                    some resistance to that. People didn't want to be out of step with my senior
                    deputy or their own office director.</p>
                <p>As far as I was concerned, the policy line was not established until the meeting
                    was over and I didn't have a line going into the meeting. I learned from this
                    process and I tried to engage people. I sometimes think that's a management
                    style that needs to be more widely used.</p>
                <p>Because otherwise it's like sending a cable out to the field in draft, to tell
                    them what to report back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think about courts martial in the military. When the
                        court votes on a verdict, the junior officer votes first, so he's not
                        influenced by what the ranking member wants.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: The place of professionalism, what does professionalism mean, what does
                    pragmatism mean, what does realism mean, what impact does ideology have to say
                    in the conduct of foreign policy. These are all interesting things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, using the African bureau as an example, you're
                        far more likely to get self-selected people who really enjoy working on
                        Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: One of the secrets to our success and I think we had personnel success
                    in the Eighties, people would say to me for years to come, “The bureau's never
                    been in the shape it was in the 1980's, never been since. What's the
                    difference?”</p>
                <pb facs="0269" n="Page0269"/>
                <p>We took recruitment very seriously. One of my deputies spent a lot of time with
                    the personnel system and we had a number of Africanists working in the personnel
                    system who knew a lot about where the bodies were buried and where good people
                    were. We reached out to people from other regions. We had a lot of people from
                    EAP and from NEA who came to our bureau.</p>
                <p>But we also had to find good opportunities for people who had always been with
                    the African Bureau. You wouldn't want to exclude them from the good
                    opportunities. So we had a mix and I think it was a healthy mix.</p>
                <p>But the reason we could recruit is because we were doing interesting things, so
                    we could offer good jobs. In addition, AF has a lot of posts and a lot of
                    jobs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the crown jewel, the title of ambassador. You've got a
                        lot of countries, not much competition from the political appointees..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROCKER: That's right. So people would be very interested. But I like to bring
                    them in before they suddenly wanted to go for the crown jewel. Let's get
                    somebody who's hungry to start by becoming an office director in West Africa,
                    then we'll talk about that ambassadorship.</p>
