                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is February 15, 1997, and we are interviewing Arthur
                        Marshall Fell who has had a long career in international development and
                        with the Agency for International Development. How many years have you been
                        associated with AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: I started in AID in December of 1969, and I retired in May of 1990.</p>
                <p>Early years, education and military experience</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's start out this interview with a little discussion of
                        your early life, where you came from, where you grew up, your education, and
                        then we'll move on to other aspects of your career.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: I was born in Bloomington, Indiana. There was a movie made about
                    Bloomington, Indiana called Breaking Away which some people might have seen, and
                    it's a quarry town. There are two sides to the town. One side is a Big Ten
                    university, Indiana University. The other side of the town is like the quarry
                    side of the town or the other side of the tracks. Every time I tell people that
                    I'm from Bloomington, Indiana they say, “Oh, you must be associated with the
                    university,” but we weren't associated with the university. We were in the junk
                    business. My father was in the scrap iron and steel business, so we were from t
                    he other side of the tracks. Growing up in Bloomington, Indiana where I was born
                    in 1935 on December 19, I actually went to the University High School, sort of a
                    training school of Indiana University. So I had a lot of association with
                    professors' children. I suppose I sort of got a taste for international
                    relations contact with other languages and international society from roaming
                    around Indiana University and seeing people from all different places, and I got
                    sort of interested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go to university there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you major in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: I majored in business and economics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any aspects of those courses or program that
                        you found particularly instructive in your international work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: Well I took Spanish, and I was always interested in Latin America strangely
                    enough. In those days during vacation time, people would go to Cuba or Mexico on
                    vacation. I think I did that several times. I was interested in Latin America.
                    Insofar as the courses I took, I never really thought I would get involved in
                    anything international. It just seemed so distant and so far away that I
                    couldn't imagine it at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you traveled to Cuba and Mexico, how did you find
                        those countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: I was absolutely intrigued and interested. I was always sort of interested
                    in how other people lived, the languages they spoke and how their culture
                    related to our culture. There are different approaches to history. Some people
                    will tell you that history is created by events and great people. The counter to
                    history is a lot of little people doing a lot of little things: the shopkeepers
                    and artisans and farmers. I'm more interested in that aspect of things, the
                    ordinary people how they lived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you do any studies during those trips or was it just
                        travel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: No they were just for vacations and holidays.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you graduated from the university, did you go on with
                        your studies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: I graduated in 1957. In those days it was unthinkable not to go into the
                    Army. I was in ROTC and I joined the US. Army. I had a commission. In those days
                    you could sign up for Army Language School, and I went to Monterey, California.
                    I wanted to study Spanish. They had six month courses where the Army does a
                    first rate job like they do in teaching. Instead of taking Spanish where there
                    wasn't any room, they sent me to French. So I took French and ended up getting
                    assigned in France, and liked it very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you assigned?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>FELL: I was originally assigned in the headquarters of what was then the
                    communications zone. In those days (the late 1950s), we had about 50,000 troops
                    stationed in France. I was originally in Orleans and then got assigned to La
                    Rochelle and eventually to Verdun, so I had three different assignments in
                    France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>FELL: Originally I was in the counter intelligence agency. We were doing security
                    surveys and background checks. Then I married a Frenchwoman while I was here in
                    France. They removed me from the counter intelligence corps and I was put into
                    the military police. I ended up having an interesting job. This is an aside
                    actually but it might have some relationship. I was the commander of a little
                    depot. The United States built two atomic storage sites in France in the late
                    1950's. One of them was Chalon sur Marne and the other was outside of Verdun
                    about 20 kilometers. I remember reporting to this atomic storage site the United
                    States Army Corps of Engineers had built. It was quite an elaborate affair over
                    500-600 hectares. Most of it was all underground. Very elaborate with
                    underground igloos and huge bunkers and calibration facilities. I went in there
                    and there was a Major there he said,”I'm glad you are here Lieutenant. You are
                    in charge of this place. Because the United States can't use it.” In fact,
                    President Kennedy had come to see De Gaulle in 1960 very early in his
                    administration when he came to Paris. The first thing De Gaulle asked was he
                    said,” You built two atomic storage sites in France. One thing we have to make
                    very clear is if you ever decide you are going to push on the red button, you
                    have to consult with France.” That phrase became very well known in France. It
                    became “Poussez sur le bouton rouge,” which was a code way of saying we have to
                    know everything that goes on in our country, and of you have an atomic storage
                    site, we have to have people assigned there, we have to know what is going on
                    and how it was operating and all that. That meant we would have to share secrets
                    with France. Kennedy blinked and he said,”No!” We were afraid of leaks. They had
                    a lot of what we thought were Communists in government and people we could not
                    trust, and so De Gaulle said, “In that case you will not be able to stock atomic
                    material in France, and you won't be able to use these two depots.” That's when
                    I stepped into history, Haven, because they assigned me to this depot we
                    couldn't use. There was nothing in it, although the United States Army decided
                    we could put about 5000 tons of conventional ammunition, which we did in that
                    depot. Then there was the Berlin buildup about that time. It was 1962. I was in
                    charge of this depot and I had about 20 military police. A little known fact
                    that after W.W.II there were many Polish and Lithuanians, and Latvians floating
                    around, stateless people, and they were incorporated into a paramilitary
                    organization called the Polish Guard which was used to guard American bases at
                    that time. I had a platoon of Polish Guards and a platoon of military police and
                    we just sort of checked on the perimeter fence, made sure all the bunkers were
                    closed and I got a pool table. We were 20 kilometers away from headquarters. No
                    one bothered us. The next thing you know there was the Berlin Airlift. This is a
                    digression, but it is going to hookup with something, I'm sure, back in the
                    Pentagon they wanted to be sure that the Berlin Buildup was not a paper
                    operation. We were actually going to show the Russians that we were serious
                    about what we were doing. We were going to bring 100,000 troops over from the
                    United States and show that we were going to resist whatever happened. To show
                    that it wasn't a paper operation they decided to bring all the logistics for
                    100,000 troops. It is mind boggling to think about doing something like that.
                    The basic load of ammunition means that you have to fire for three months or
                    something like that without worrying about where it is going to come from. I'm
                    sure they were worrying where are we going to put all this ammunition. Someone
                    in Washington must have had the brilliant idea, you have these atomic storage
                    sites. Why don't we just put the ammunition in them. They decided to put a lot
                    of it in there. We had a train coming in to the depot, and it operated right all
                    day. It made me realize how a big organization like the US. Government can
                    operate fast and very efficiently if the government wants to. They brought in
                    1000 troops within ten days. I went from being in charge of the depot to being
                    the PX officer for the depot. In a way it sort of made me realize how big
                    operations have to be carried out. USAID later on in my career did not do
                    exactly comparable things but it did things that had a certain parallel,
                    particularly in emergencies.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much time to make contact with the French
                        community at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: Absolutely. I had a lot of contact with the French community, of course,
                    having been married to a Frenchwoman. When I was there in this particular depot,
                    we had just finished building that particular depot. This is a very important
                    point in linking up. In building this depot we had a lot of Corps of Engineer
                    trucks that had come in to carry dirt and bring in materials and steel and
                    cement. We absolutely wrecked all the roads in that region just by having trucks
                    coming through all the time, night and day. One of the things the US Army tried
                    to do was to repair the damage from a personal relations standpoint that we had
                    with these villages. I went into many of these villages that surrounded the camp
                    and met with the mayor and we'd sit down and talk. There was really very little
                    we could do about the physical deterioration of the roads because we had a
                    status of forces agreement with the French and they were in charge of doing the
                    roads. But we could kind of hold their hand and try to explain what was going on
                    and try to build better relations and if there were problems that did come up,
                    we'd try to iron them out. We would have soldiers that would go into villages
                    and go into bars and who knows what kinds of things could happen. All kinds of
                    things did happen. That was one of the things I did was try to build good
                    relations with local population and officials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You became a public relations person.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: Exactly. Eventually one of the mayors made me an honorary citizen of his
                    town and gave me the keys to the village. We tried to show that there were
                    person to person relationships between us and them. We did a little bit to try
                    to improve relations despite the fact that they had plenty to complain about the
                    way we were operating. After I left and got out of the Army; I took an overseas
                    discharge. In those days you could take an overseas discharge and you had a
                    ticket back to the United States for one year. You can remember that going
                    between the United States and Europe was not an easy thing to do in those days.
                    It was expensive and we never really thought of going across the Atlantic that
                    easily. So I stayed in Europe; I stayed in France. I traveled around and went to
                    the Middle East. I traveled to Greece and went to Rhodes. I spent several months
                    in Israel working on a Kibbutz with my wife in agricultural work. Then I came
                    back. I remember I went to Bremerhaven and checked into the shipyard there. They
                    said this is the last day you can get back to the United States, and they put me
                    on a ship, and I went back to the United States, went back to law school and
                    graduated law school in 1966.</p>

                <p>FELL: There really wasn't much one could do in terms of concentration in those
                    days. I took the standard courses. There weren't very many optional courses you
                    could take. I took one course in comparative law. I spoke French fluently and
                    Spanish maybe a little less fluently because the French had pushed out the
                    Spanish. I had been overseas and I had a little different vision on things from
                    some of my colleagues that were in law school because I was about three or four
                    years older than most of them. I had been traveling quite a bit. I graduated law
                    school in 1966 and passed the Indiana bar, but my wife didn't want to stay in
                    Indiana. She wanted to see the big town. I was lucky enough I had done well in
                    law school and was editor in chief of the Indiana Law Journal which was a fairly
                    prestigious. So I was able to get a very good job in New York with a very good
                    law firm, and passed the bar in New York and started practicing law in New York.
                    That's where I was in 1966 and 1967 and 1968.</p>

                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>FELL: I was doing everything that you can imagine. I was working in an
                    international law firm. It was called Davis, Polk, Wardwell, Sunderland, and
                    Kiendl which was in the Chase Manhattan Plaza. It turned out it was a very blue
                    blood law firm. We had some very interesting clients like the estate of Winston
                    Churchill, ITT and CIBA, very upscale clients. I worked on many different
                    things. I remember in those days they were going to break up AT&amp;T. They were
                    talking about beginning to break up AT&amp;T. I was assigned the job of
                    researching how this might be done. The very first one was Southern Bell that
                    they were going to break off of AT&amp;T and I was given an assignment is this
                    OKAY? I found out that one of the ways they were going to do the accounting
                    wasn't quite right; it didn't match up. They were absolutely sure that
                    everything was clean because the AT&amp;T lawyers had looked at it. When I told
                    my senior capital partner who was a very famous man in those days, FAO Schwartz
                    the toy man. I told him this doesn't match up and I showed him the statute and
                    how it failed to meet the requirements. He said this is absolutely astounding.
                    They are not going to believe this when they see this. We had a big meeting with
                    the AT&amp;T lawyers and they absolutely blew their stack and couldn't
                    understand how this had slipped through their system. That set me up quite well
                    in the law form. They thought this was quite a nice piece of research. Then I
                    had another big piece of research. One of our clients was being sued. It was an
                    advertising agency that was being sued for Thalidomide. The advertising agency
                    had handled the account of the Thalidomide, and they were being sued by a
                    pharmaceutical company. It was quite a complicated case. The net result of it
                    was that I was able to do some research that showed the agency hadn't been hurt
                    by having handled this advertising and there wasn't any cause of action. I
                    worked on another interesting case. They were putting cables across the Atlantic
                    Ocean in those days. One of our clients was putting this cable across the
                    Atlantic Ocean and had failed to get landing rights from British Telecom. The
                    argument they made was the United States government had not put sufficient
                    pressure on the British government to permit it to get the landing rights. We
                    had quite a lawsuit about that issue. We lost it I think. I told them we were
                    going to lose it.</p>
                <p>Eventually I kind of got disaffected like a lot of people in the 60's. I heard of
                    a fellowship offer at Columbia University called the Jervy fellowship in
                    comparative and international law whereby we could spend a year at Columbia
                    University and a year in France and work on an advanced degree in law. I went to
                    that and spent two years at Columbia University in this fellowship program and
                    studied comparative and international law and came to France. This was in 1968.
                    1968 in France was total chaos; it was a cleavage year. I really didn't do a lot
                    of study in France. I remember I was wondering what am I going to do when I come
                    back to the United States? Am I going to go back to my law firm? I put in a
                    application to USAID.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything of particular interest in your graduate
                        studies?</hi>

                <p>FELL: I actually had gotten interested in a rather non-lucrative aspect of
                    international law. I got interested in comparative historical preservation. I
                    was very interested in the way the Europeans had and the kinds of laws and
                    regulations they had established to preserve historical monuments. I thought
                    that this would be a very good thing if in the United States we were able to do
                    something along those lines to preserve physically our historical past. It turns
                    out that I was not very realistic in my approach. I was more idealistic than I
                    should have been. Now this is being done to some extent in the United States
                    more and more based on tax concessions, is that historical buildings can be
                    protected probably better through that way than simply ruling that you can't
                    tear them down or change them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You heard about AID toward this time. Where did you hear
                        about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: I think I had seen USAID projects in various countries and heard about the
                    Marshall Plan. You couldn't possibly have come to Europe in those years and not
                    have heard about what the United States had done during those years and the good
                    publicity that had done and the good feelings that had created and the fact that
                    France was beginning to take off and other countries in Europe were beginning to
                    take off and that the United States had played a major role in that work. I
                    remember when I was in Israel I saw clasped hands on roads and so I knew we had
                    done a lot of things there that were physically on the ground. I think I was
                    looking around to get something, since I had studied comparative and
                    international law at Columbia, that would be related to international affairs. I
                    thought that USAID would be an agency that would be interesting and also would
                    provide the opportunity to go overseas.</p>

                <p>Work with the Office of Economic Opportunity</p>
                <p>FELL: I think I got the actual address out of a US Government manual. There is a
                    book that is published of all the agencies in the US Government, The US
                    Organization Manual or something like that. I got a copy at the consulate. I was
                    looking through it and saw USAID. I read the description of it and saw the
                    address, and I put in an application.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You really didn't know much about the organization.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>FELL: Not really. In a very general way. I never knew specifically nor had I
                    talked to anybody that had worked for USAID that I knew of. When I went back to
                    the states I had put in this application and it took a long time for USAID to
                    crank in those days, and I guess it still does with security and whatnot. So
                    when I got back I was waiting for an answer. This is an interesting story,
                    Haven, how I actually interviewed USAID. When I got back I started working in
                    New York which was sort of a point of attachment. I had friend whom I had known
                    in law practice who was counsel for the OEO, the Office of Economic Opportunity,
                    that was headed up by Donald Rumsfeld in those days, which was kind of the US
                    aid program in the United States, the original one. I worked as a lawyer in the
                    OEO in New York for several months just sort of waiting for an answer from
                    USAID. I was doing very much community development and grants to local
                    communities and watching out on these grants and following up on t hem. In a way
                    it was kind of an introduction to the work I would eventually do in USAID. I
                    remember holding hearings. Organizations would be set up to receive OEO grants.
                    The OEO would once in a while figure that some of these organizations would go
                    too far, weren't handling the money well or weren't doing a good job. In order
                    to withhold these grants there would have to be some sort of a hearing. I
                    handled several of these kinds of hearings we would hold for these
                    organizations. It was quite wild because these were local level people working
                    on local issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was strictly in the New York area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: New York, Connecticut. Some of them would be in not so very good
                    neighborhoods. All the people would turn out trying to make a case saying that
                    this organization was doing a good job. Usually it had been based on some
                    information that investigators had turned up that they weren't handling the
                    money properly or weren't being effective and we'd have a hearing and take all
                    the evidence and make some sort of decision on it whether we'd continue or not.
                    In most cases we'd continue the grants. It's something we found out at the AID
                    and a principle that I learned at the OECD, once programs get started, they just
                    tend to keep going on; it's very hard to stop them. So it is very important to
                    start them well and get on the right issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You also tried to improve the program and restructure
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: Restructure it. Try to figure out what the bottlenecks were, what the
                    problems were, where things weren't being handled well.</p>
                <p>Joined USAID in the General Counsel's Office, Africa Bureau - 1969</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>There was actually an interesting thing that happened when I came to interview
                    USAID. The first day I came down, in those days the General Counsel for USAID
                    was a man named Steve Ives. There was a man named Sollins who was sort of in
                    charge of hiring lawyers. I talked to him and everything went well. He said he'd
                    talk to a couple of the geographic offices and we'll see how it goes. I talked
                    to Mr. Levy in Latin America where I was most interested, and I talked to Herb
                    Morris in Asia, who incidentally is here in Paris today with his wife. He's
                    retired now. I had a feeling after a couple of days that things weren't going
                    very well. My mother and father had come with me just to take a vacation in
                    Washington DC. I said, “Well, I think we'll leave.” As I think back on it I
                    can't remember how it actually happened. We had checked out of the hotel and
                    were leaving Washington DC and driving home after the first day of interviews. I
                    was supposed to come back the second day. My father said how did it go? I said
                    something like: “I guess the interviews went OKAY. I'm supposed to go back the
                    next day, the day following the interviews. I don't think I will. We're leaving
                    now because I don't think the interviews went very well.” We were driving on the
                    highway leaving Washington DC and my father slammed on the brakes and said,
                    “What did you say? You told these gentlemen you were coming back for an
                    interview and we're leaving now. How could you do such a thing, Arthur?” I said,
                    “Yes but I don't think it was going very well.” He said, “That doesn't have
                    anything to do with it. You told them you were going back for an interview. You
                    go back.” He drove me back down to the State Department and checked into another
                    hotel. This was an amazing thing. If my father had not put his foot on the brake
                    at that moment, I would never have joined USAID. My father is what we call today
                    very square. You could give him your wallet and come back the next day and it
                    would be there. He was one of those people who lived by certain rules and ideals
                    that are getting rarer and rarer. I went back and the next day who did I meet?
                    Jim Phippard. He was the assistant general counsel for the Africa Bureau.</p>

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>FELL: This was in 1969. We had a good interview, and I met Jerry Zarr and Mike
                    Hager who was in that office. I don't know who might have left at that time, but
                    they had a lot of legal work in the Africa Bureau as you know, Haven. To make a
                    long story short, I was hired into that office. As I look back, that was the
                    first office that I started working in. It was in the Africa Bureau. At that
                    time John Hannah was head of the Agency. the Deputy Administrator was Rutherford
                    Poats the Assistant Administrator for Africa was Sam Adams. His Deputy was Phil
                    Birnbaum in those days. In later years I said our office was an illustrious
                    office; everyone made good except me. There was Jim Phippard who eventually
                    became Mission Director in Tunisia, Jery Zarr who eventually became Mission
                    Director in Ghana and elsewhere. An individual who came into that office after I
                    had been there was Charles Gladson who eventually became Assistant Administrator
                    for Vietnam and Mission Director in Kenya but that's another story. For the
                    first year I was in an office without a window, and my wife thought this was
                    terrible. I say this because sometimes you have to labor in the vineyards and
                    you don't always have the best of accommodations. People from the outside think
                    everything is always clean and all that, but sometimes we work in dingy, dark
                    offices. There were offices in the State Department Building that didn't have
                    windows, and I had one like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you working on mostly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: I worked on our main client in those days which was a very good office in
                    the Africa Bureau called the Capital Development Finance Office (CDF). It
                    managed the loans. We had two parts to our aid program. There was the grants
                    part of the aid program and the loan part. It turned out, this is something I
                    could never quite figure out. The loan part was extremely tightly managed. The
                    office that managed it was the Capital Development and Finance Office which was
                    staffed mostly by MBA's who were young business oriented individuals in an
                    office that was headed up by Robert Freeman. His Deputy was an extremely savvy
                    individual, Al Disdier. Under him was Ed Skoll on one side and Steve Klein on
                    the other and under them were several young MBA's. They managed this portfolio
                    of the loans projects that AID made in Africa. Once a week Al Disdier would hold
                    a meeting, and he had a great big book that had every loan AID made in Africa,
                    and he would go page by page through that book and say exactly where do we stand
                    with each one of these projects. The whole project committee would be sitting
                    there and we would say has the letter of commitment been opened, has the letter
                    of credit been issued, have the invitation for bids been issued, have you
                    followed up on this, who checked on that? Every single item of every single loan
                    was checked once a week. We had a very tight management system in that office. I
                    often think as I look back that this was one of the most cleanly functioning
                    offices I've ever worked at while at AID. Highly professional.</p>

                <p>FELL: The one that really stands out in my mind and the one I guess I made a
                    little bit of a mark for myself with. I joined AID in 1969. But in earlier years
                    many things had been done maybe expeditiously or deals were put together.
                    Sometimes you would go back into the files and ask what were these deals exactly
                    because they were done at a time when maybe rules and procedures hadn't been
                    solidified in AID. One of these became what was called a chestnut, and that was
                    in Guinea. We had made an operation. It's hard to say what it was but an
                    operation to provide airplanes to Air Guinea. These airplanes had come from Air
                    Alaska. Guinea had for many years been unsatisfied with these airplanes which
                    hadn't operated, they claimed. We claimed that they had not been maintained
                    properly whereas the Guineans maintained that they had not been very good
                    aircraft to begin with and they shouldn't have to pay on these aircraft. The
                    State Department was worried because there was a provision in the foreign
                    assistance act 620Q that said that if a country fell behind in its payments of
                    interest or capital to the United States Government they couldn't receive any
                    new projects. This was causing a lot of political problems because we wanted to
                    maintain relations with Guinea which is one of the richest countries in West
                    Africa with tremendous potential but was one of the countries that voted no to
                    the French Franc zone. So it was in a certain equation with our relationships
                    with Guinea. The State Department kept coming back and saying what can we do
                    about this. This had gone on for many years. I was called in. I remember the
                    head of the West African office in those days was Rudolph Aggrey who was one of
                    the most senior blacks in the State Department in those days. He said, “You've
                    got to figure out something. What are we going to do about this?” I took this
                    project and started looking at it and it turned out that it had been a very
                    peculiar operation from the very beginning. It actually had not been, in a true
                    sense a loan. It had been an exchange of notes. We came to the conclusion and I
                    wrote the opinion on this, that this did not fall within the purview of 620Q
                    because it was actually not a loan, due to the way it had been structured. This
                    enabled us to tell the Guineans that while they were legally obliged to repay it
                    wasn't within the purview of being a loan from the United States Government
                    which would have prevented us from providing any additional assistance. I
                    remember when I wrote this opinion up. I suppose in these kinds of opinions
                    there is a certain amount of flexibility. You can see the accordion over in the
                    corner. I play the accordion. There is a certain amount of discretion you can
                    play. But from a strictly legal standpoint, one was able to come to the
                    conclusion this was not actually a loan in the sense of the kind of loan we were
                    talking about in the assistance act because it hadn't been structured that way.
                    It was a completely different type of transaction. They loved that, and after
                    that I was known as the lawyer who had pulled the chestnut out of the fire.
                    Another project concerned the Chisamayo Port in Somalia, which had had a lot of
                    costly overruns. Actually the contract was managed by the US Corps of Engineers.
                    The Africa Bureau was trying to figure out some way for the Corps of Engineers
                    to take responsibility for some of these overruns since they were the ones who
                    were managing the program. I remember Phil Birnbaum who was the Deputy Assistant
                    Administrator called me in and said, “Can't we sue the Corps of Engineers?”
                    Actually I looked at a lot of the aspects of this but it turned out that one
                    agency of the United States Government can't sue another agency of the United
                    States Government. In practical purposes there was nothing we could do about it.
                    They in a sense were our agent for carrying out this project and if there is an
                    overrun, that's the way it goes. It took quite a bit of our budget that
                    particular year. I know that in those years the budget of the Africa Bureau was
                    around $150,000,000. This was about a $3,000,000 overrun so it was a
                    considerable amount. I remember when this came to a head, the head of
                    engineering for USAID was Dan Miller. He was a rather blustery type fellow. I
                    remember him telling how the Chisamayo Port was falling apart because the rods
                    on the inside hadn't been grouted properly. The Corps of Engineers had done the
                    wrong type of work or hadn't supervised it properly. Years later we did
                    rehabilitate the Chisamayo port when Lou Cohen was in Somalia. This might have
                    been in the 1980's. Lou claimed he found an order in the files that actually
                    authorized the contractor to wash the aggregate with sea water which I guess was
                    an incredible thing to an engineer to allow that type of thing to be done which
                    may have been one of the reasons why the port had deteriorated as it had. I
                    don't think we knew that at that particular time, in 1969. All we had was a
                    feeling that the Corps of Engineers hadn't done quite as good of a job as they
                    might have done and, darn it, they ought to pay for it. We arranged for a
                    meeting with Mr.. Poats and one of the generals from the Corps of Engineers to
                    hash this out. It turned to nothing. The general came over with his staff. They
                    presented their case and said that everything we've done is not that bad, we
                    supervised it and the port is there and is operating. There was nothing we could
                    do about it basically. It's a cost overrun; that's just the way things go.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Many other projects we worked on in those days, eradicating smallpox in West
                    Africa, working on buying vaccines and letting out for bids. There were trucks
                    that had been bought for a major operation in the eradication of smallpox. I
                    think this is one of the great success stories of foreign assistance that has
                    not been given much of a highlight. Think what it would cost today if smallpox
                    had not been eradicated. That every single person in the world had to have a
                    little piece of paper. You had to go and get a vaccination, and you were scarred
                    for life once, twice, maybe three times. This was going on all over the world
                    and once and for all this had been eradicated from the face of the earth. Those
                    of us who have worked in Africa and have seen this situation work can certify
                    morally it would have been impossible to have ever done this without foreign
                    assistance. You had USAID out there working, carrying out training, getting the
                    vaccinations out there to the villages. This is one of the great success stories
                    that is not given credit. I suppose if you start adding up what the bill would
                    have been had smallpox not been eradicated, it would have been in the billions
                    of dollars. We worked on malaria eradication projects. In later years I was
                    assigned to Cameroon and I had a little bit to do with the trans-Cameroon
                    railroad in Washington; much more to do with it when I went out to the
                    field.</p>
                <p>Something happened and I was about ready to leave USAID after about a year and a
                    half after being in Washington. I can't tell you exactly why. I was finishing up
                    a doctoral thesis at Columbia University and was getting offers to teach law.
                    Actually I got one very strong offer to teach law from colleagues that I had
                    known in the legal profession. They wanted me to come to Valparaiso University.
                    I also got an extremely interesting offer working on different projects, working
                    on the Guinea project, and somehow the Harvey Aluminum Company had gotten my
                    name. I think I might have met someone involved with the Harvey Aluminum Company
                    at one of the meetings we had in Guinea. They invited me to Pittsburgh and said
                    would you like to come to work for Harvey Aluminum Company? We need a general
                    counsel. This was a very large aluminum company, a conglomerate of all the
                    aluminum companies in the world that were operating the bauxite site in Guinea.
                    I actually went out to Pittsburgh twice and interviewed with them and they
                    offered me a job. Then something happened. I didn't accept that job. Something
                    else had happened that changed my whole life. A project was being generated in
                    Madagascar of all places. Al Disdier was coming to Paris to talk to the head of
                    a large petroleum company in the United States named Anderson. He was head of an
                    equity investing firm. This Anderson was head of Atlantic Richfield, a very
                    wealthy man. He was dabbling in livestock, and they were interested in doing a
                    livestock project in Madagascar at Majunga, Madagascar. Al Disdier was working
                    on this project and he wanted a lawyer to come along with him to Paris because
                    we were going to talk to the Caisse Fran�ais and the French. Strangely enough, I
                    now work at the OECD. The embassy of Madagascar is not 100 yards from where I
                    work today. But this was in about 1970 when this happened. We went there. Al
                    Disdier was I think one of the most talented people we ever had in the Africa
                    Bureau, very well organized, and he was also a native French speaker. His family
                    had been French trappers somewhere out west, I guess in Montana. He appreciated
                    the fact that I spoke fluent French so we got along together very well.</p>

                <p>Assigned to the African Development Bank as technical advisor - 1921</p>
                <p>When we got back to Washington he said, “Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire main tenant?”
                    What are you going to do now? I said I don't know. I've got an offer to go out
                    and teach law out in the Midwest. He said no I've got a better idea for you.
                    We've got a job in the African Development Bank which is being staffed by Owen
                    Cylke, who maybe has contributed to this history of USAID, too. This brings up
                    another interesting facet about USAID and the way we operated. At one point AID
                    had as many as 18,000 providing technical assistance in the field worldwide. In
                    later years we operated through consultants and through firms and government
                    agencies and participating agency agreements and whatever. In the earlier years
                    of AID, we actually had people on the payroll getting a green check from the
                    United States Government in AID who were actually working on projects, were
                    actually building roads, were actually on farms, were in the ministries doing
                    technical advising and that sort of thing. It turned out I did that. I think it
                    was very fortunate. Now when people talk about technical cooperation or what a
                    technical cooperation assistant does, I did it and so I have a little better
                    understanding of what the role of that type of person is. Owen Cylke had been
                    assigned to the African Development Bank. This was in the early years. It was
                    one of the great institutions that was created in the 1960's. In 1966 it was
                    created as one of the great institutions that would bring the African Countries
                    together. It would bring Africans together where they would analyze projects
                    together and finance projects together. It was an African institution, based in
                    Abidjan. We were looking for ways that we could help this organization, help
                    this bank come into its own. One of the things we decided to do was to help them
                    build their portfolio. This was rather typical of the Disdier approach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was right at the beginning of the bank?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: The beginning of the bank. Actually the bank in its first four or five
                    years didn't have many operations. One of the reasons the bank didn't have many
                    operations was the same reason why others had trouble making loans in Africa,
                    which later on we found maybe we shouldn't be making loans in Africa; it was
                    very hard to find good projects. Al Disdier to his credit had come up with this
                    analysis. He said the bank is not going to be operational unless it can find
                    bankable projects. It was hard to find bankable projects or to bring projects to
                    a position where they could be financed. So he worked up an idea that we would
                    provide a grant to the bank to help them develop projects. At the very beginning
                    it was to study the feasibility of doing projects. Owen Cylke was out there to
                    help get this grant working. Because here's another aspect too I think. You
                    almost have to be a genius to be on the other side of the counter to use USAID
                    money. It isn't self evident. Or to use any donors money and use it well, and to
                    make sure that it fits well with the priorities of the policies of the donor
                    agency that is providing it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did you have to be a genius?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>FELL: Well, there are a lot of procedures, requirements, the methodologies and
                    just a lot of paperwork. In a minute I'm going to try to explain how one of
                    these projects took place. Genius is an exaggeration. It would take more of a
                    plugger, a plodder to get through a lot of these procedures. Al thought we ought
                    to have a little package and have someone out there doing technical assistance
                    to help the bank to understand how to work with us and to train their people so
                    they could work with us and other donors, and to use this money to actually
                    develop projects to help build up their portfolio, and by building up their
                    portfolio and lending operations, the bank would gain experience and become a
                    more mature operation. It was very practical. I think everyone in the history of
                    the bank that has been written believed this was a very important element in the
                    early years of the bank. Owen had been there for about two years, and he had not
                    been able to use any of the grant money for any feasibility study or any loans.
                    Not because he didn't work hard at it, he was one of the most talented people we
                    had at USAID. He did develop a lot of ideas for projects and got things started.
                    I was able to build on a lot of the work Owen did.</p>
                <p>One of the first projects he identified, which was a very interesting project was
                    a bridge over the Mano River between Sierra Leone and Liberia. We helped create
                    the Mano River authority, draft their arrangements and come to some sort of
                    agreement on building the bridge over the international waterway. I remember
                    going back to Washington saying: do you have any models for building bridges
                    over international waterways? We weren't able to come up with one that would
                    help me. I made many trips to Liberia and Sierra Leone in those days trying to
                    get these two countries to agree to build a bridge, so they would agree where it
                    should be built and how it should be built and come to agreement on terms of
                    reference. So we had four partners you had to get together on this. In the
                    background you had, first, USAID, second, the bank itself which had people
                    working with their own ideas, third, Sierra Leone, and you had fourth, Liberia.
                    Of course in the countries there was local political jockeying for where these
                    bridges should be. In those days those countries were relatively stable, I mean
                    they weren't in the turmoil they are in today. To go from Monrovia, the capital
                    of Liberia to Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, you had to go hundreds of
                    miles through Guinea because there was no bridge across the Mano River anywhere
                    along that border. I've been there myself several times, and the river is not
                    that wide. You had canoes going back and forth but there was no actual traffic
                    except for in a couple of places there may have been some ferryboats that
                    operated erratically.</p>
                <p>Owen had convinced Washington, a very interesting thing. In those days we had
                    rough estimates of how much the bridge would cost. It would cost $1,000,000 to
                    $1,500,000 to build the bridge. There were some access roads that had to be
                    built to connect up to the main highways. He said, “Look, let's not go into a
                    feasibility study on this. It is self evident that these countries ought to be
                    able to commerce with each other, with a road link. We could spend $100,000
                    -$200,000 to find out what the feasibility of this might be. Let's just do it
                    and not waste the money. It is self evident that it ought to be done.”
                    Washington agreed, and our local offices agreed that was the right approach.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean the lawyers on Washington let you get by the
                        legislation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: We had enough we felt we could make the argument. It's almost like one of
                    these things I've seen later on. Almost on the back of an envelope you can get
                    someone who knows a lot about the geography of a certain place or a certain
                    thing, you can get 80-90% from a person who knows a lot about the subject. To
                    get the other 10% you could spend a lot of money and never be sure you got the
                    other 10% down right. I think that was an example where we had 80-90% of the
                    information we needed. Because you are working on a hypothetical where you don't
                    have a bridge, what is the bridge going to create, what kind of synergies, what
                    kind of economic development? We don't know because there has never been one
                    there and we don't know exactly what would happen. So that was sort of the
                    argument. But we did agree to go, and this is another thing that Al Disdier was
                    very good about. He realized the feasibility study was fine but you had to go
                    another step forward to help the bank, and that was to help them do the design
                    study itself so that the project was really ready to be financed. That is not
                    such an easy step, it takes a lot of work. This is where the procedures come
                    into play. What this took, if you are going to have open bidding, you are going
                    to have a pre-contractor selection. Are you going to go for a short list or not
                    a short list. In any case you have to advertise in the Congressional Daily. We'd
                    advertise in the Congressmen's Daily and get a hundred responses back. We'd
                    answer those hundred responses. Then we'd do a short list and explain to
                    everybody why they are not on the short list because we'd get reclamas. We'd get
                    the short list of five or six and then re-do the bids, put out the bids. We'd
                    come back and have to set up a committee, everybody has to look at these bids;
                    we had to judge them; we had to have some system by which we look at them in
                    some objective way, rate them and try to negotiate with the best offer. In those
                    days you couldn't include price for the price of a consultant at least. I
                    remember the first negotiations we had. It was with Frank Lyons. It was a
                    consulting firm that had done a lot of work in Vietnam, and it was headed up by
                    a fellow named Frank Lyons who was quite a well-to-do man. He came out himself
                    to Africa to negotiate this contract to do the engineering on this bridge over
                    the Mano River. He was quite an impressive figure, and I was impressed that he,
                    himself had come out there. We were getting a lot of attention from high level
                    people in these consulting firms because they wanted to get their foot in the
                    door of the African Development Bank at an early period of time. So we were
                    getting more than the ordinary amount of hustling from consulting firms. That
                    means pressure from their Congressman, pressures being put back on Washington
                    the AID Bureau, all these bids had come out; have we really been considered? So
                    there were a lot of letters flying around. This was another thing the Capital
                    Development Finance Office had been attuned to and able to handle. You have to
                    massage every one of these and show there is a transferring system and show
                    everything is done in an above board way. In this case, the African Development
                    Bank being one step away from USAID itself, and my being in the African
                    Development Bank, I think we wanted to show that everyone was being given a fair
                    shake.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FELL: I was a staff person, yes. There was another point I wanted to make. Being
                    in the bank was an extraordinarily interesting period for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's finish up on the project. What happened to the
                        bridge?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: The bridge eventually got built. It was operated and maintained by the two
                    countries for many years. I don't think it created the fillip for development in
                    that area that we thought. It did have a certain amount of traffic. We would
                    have hoped it facilitated more development, but other things overcame. The
                    events in Sierra Leone and Liberia, the almost political disintegration of both
                    countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The bridge is still there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: The bridge is still there operating and being used. I think it brought the
                    two countries together and maybe will eventually be another asset that can be
                    used.During my tenure I think we did at least fifteen projects that were
                    conceived and actually built. In fact I saw one recently. I was in Cotonou in
                    Benin. There was a bridge in Cotonou that AID had been looking at for many years
                    that was falling apart. It dated from the French colonial days. Quite a
                    complicated study was done because a port had been built in Cotonou which had
                    changed the ocean currents and this had changed the way the erosion patterns
                    were taking place so the bridge was falling apart faster than it normally would.
                    An American firm Sanders and Thomas did a feasibility study. Eventually the
                    African Development Bank hired Sanders and Thomas under the USAID grant to the
                    bank to do a study of a dam. Sanders and Thomas came up with what they thought
                    would be an elegant solution to this problem, building a small dam across the
                    mouth of a river that comes from an estuary inside of a lagoon which actually
                    existed in a natural way before this port had been built and also then design
                    the bridge itself. This was eventually built. It turned out that the dam did not
                    work the way they hoped it would. The bridge was built and is operating
                    there.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>We worked quite a bit on transport problems in those days because there was a
                    feeling that Africa needed better communications and better transport. You
                    talked about the West Coast Highway when you were Mission Director in Ghana.
                    They were somewhat grandiose plans but there were plans to build east-west
                    highways, an east coast highway, a west coast highway, and that this would help
                    bring Africa together. I think from a pan-African standpoint there is a certain
                    amount of truth to that; it would be a good thing to had these routes available.
                    One of the major links that was missing in the west coast highway was the link
                    between Accra and Abidjan. As you may remember, in order to go from Accra to
                    Abidjan, you have to go way up north somewhere in Ghana and over to Abengowou in
                    Ivory Coast some ten or fifteen hours. We brought in a firm, Wilbur Thomas, as I
                    remember, out of North Carolina, to do the feasibility study for that particular
                    project. We had a meeting at the African Development Bank, and the people from
                    Ghana came over, as well as the Ivorians.</p>
                <p>The Ivory Coast delegation we were very surprised on the first day was led by a
                    Frenchman. The Ghanaians were not too happy about that. There was a different
                    attitude you could see. Ghana would never have allowed a Brit to head up an
                    international delegation to one of their own institutions like the African
                    Development Bank. On the other hand, looking with a longer view, a certain
                    maturity would have said what's the difference? The Guineans were quite offended
                    that the Ivorians were being represented by a French technical cooperation
                    engineer. The next day they came in their robes. They had been dressed in suits
                    the first day; the next day they came in African robes to show they didn't like
                    this. Negotiations were not all that easy because the French weren't all that
                    anxious to get agreement on doing this link. I think the Ghanaians were more
                    interested in seeing the Accra-Abidjan link be built than the Ivorians, and much
                    less the French.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why weren't the French interested?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: I think they are always afraid of contamination from Anglophone Africa. I
                    think they are almost looking at it from a cultural standpoint. They were always
                    afraid of Nigeria, the sleeping giant and Ghana as a very active vibrant
                    Anglophone country. Ivory Coast was constituted in a different way and they
                    could get along without.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What you are implying is the French had a very dominant
                        role in deciding what was appropriate for Ivory Coast?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>FELL: Yes. I think that probably in the background, they did. Despite that, we
                    went ahead with the project. In dealing with the Ivory Coast, it was mainly
                    dealing with French technical cooperation people, and sort of the main technical
                    cooperation expert who was working on this dossier, kept questioning me: what is
                    your methodology going to be, what do you know about building roads, how does
                    this firm know anything about building roads in Africa, you don't know this or
                    that and are you going to do this or that? He was raising all sorts of
                    obstacles. Every time he would raise an obstacle, we had some very good people,
                    good engineers in the bank, engineers and technicians and economists in the bank
                    itself both African and non-African, to answer his questions.</p>
                <p>I wanted to make this point that we worked together in the bank beautifully. I
                    think we had all different nationalities, Anglophone, Francophone, Arabophone,
                    my boss was an Egyptian, his deputy was a Moroccan, my immediate boss was a
                    Senegalese. I can't remember us having any particular problems in getting
                    together or speaking to one another and finding solutions. We had Yugoslavs who
                    were on UNDP technical assistance project in our division. We had Guineans; we
                    had Tanzanians, all different nationalities and we really worked together
                    beautifully. I think that was quite inspirational for me. I remember that one of
                    my close associates was a Togolese engineer who had studied in France and also
                    at Purdue University. He had degrees from both universities, so he was able to
                    cover the gap and sort of look at things from both the American standpoint and
                    the French standpoint and bridge both cultures, if you will. His name is Gaston
                    Dossou and he just retired from the African Development Bank about two years ago
                    after thirty years at the bank. We went together to look at the Cotonou bridge,
                    and both of us were looking and said where is the site where this bridge is
                    going to be? They showed us the site. The site was actually going through one of
                    the main markets of Cotonou. There were a lot of women who were running the
                    markets there. Dossou said there was no particular reason the bridge has to be
                    at this particular site; we could build it 20 yards upstream and not really
                    disrupt this entire market here. The Dahomian said you're right and they
                    actually changed the location of the bridge so that it wouldn't disrupt where
                    this market had been operating for so many years. I should mention that in
                    addition to all the other nationalities, we also had French technical
                    cooperation people working in the bank. I always tried to get along with all of
                    them. I think we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said at the beginning that it was extremely difficult
                        to find bankable projects. Why was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>FELL: Well as we all know, for bankable projects, we had to send out
                    identification missions from the bank and get shopping lists from the countries.
                    Sometimes these were pet projects that oftentimes had not been studied by their
                    own governments. Then we had to sort and screen these to find out which ones
                    might really be bankable, because we are talking about commercial interest
                    rates. This was before the African Development Fund had been created. World Bank
                    interest rates ran 7-9% in those days. Even in the wildly optimistic estimates
                    that we would make in those days, it was hard to find a project that would have
                    an internal rate of return that would be high enough to justify a loan of that
                    type.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that? I mean what was underlying this
                        problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: I suppose what was underlying it in some cases would be the sheer cost of
                    the projects themselves for building them. Maybe the cost of building in Africa
                    was higher; we were looking at a lot of infrastructure projects. There was
                    always the low amount of traffic invariably on some of the roads. We were
                    looking at transportation projects. They just generally did not high rates of
                    return. There are different ways to calculate rates of return because behind
                    each one of those numbers are assumptions. You can change the assumptions and
                    get higher rates of return. We did sensitivity analysis and different types of
                    analysis but in the end result, this is one of the reasons we argue that just
                    because a number is attached to something ipso facto doesn't make it
                    scientifically accurate. There are other tools of analysis that are just as
                    accurate as the statistical or economic tools of analysis and sometimes just
                    good judgment. I think now in hindsight we see that too many of these projects
                    were too optimistically analyzed. They didn't have anywhere near the high rate
                    of return we thought they might have had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the state of development wasn't sufficiently far along
                        to make these projects successful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: Yes. And then there is another argument; I don't know whether we ever get
                    to the end of it. I worked on a project in Cameroon, the trans Cameroon
                    railroad. This was a huge project; I can't remember how many hundreds of
                    kilometers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is while you still were in Abidjan?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>FELL: No I had been transferred to Cameroon. I'm jumping ahead I guess. Maybe I
                    should finish up on Abidjan, some of the other projects we had to do. The
                    Accra-Abidjan road, we had to do drillings and corings and we had to look at the
                    soils, and Wilbur Thomas was in on this, and eventually that road, that bridge
                    was built and the access roads were built and now you can go between Accra and
                    Abidjan I suppose in eight or nine hours where before it probably used to take
                    you a day. I think that someday that will play a role in bringing those
                    countries together. I remember the first time I went across the bridge,
                    something happened to me, one of the banes of Africa because Africa is divided
                    up into many countries. You get stopped and you get roadblocks, and you have
                    many customs agents and people shaking you down. I remember stopping at that
                    bridge and I almost got shook down despite the fact I had CD plates. I thought
                    my goodness, I'd helped build this bridge and I was almost getting shook down by
                    a policeman. This was several years later when I was based in Abidjan, we went
                    between Accra and Abidjan by road and we got stopped 14 times at roadblocks,
                    whether it be for customs or forestry or whatever. Each one of these was almost
                    like medieval times. If we hadn't had diplomatic plates we would have to buy out
                    way through. I think this is one of the great frictions of transportation and
                    commerce in Africa.</p>
                <p>There were many other projects we worked on with that grant to the African
                    Development Bank. We worked on transport projects throughout Africa and some
                    agricultural projects. Also I got insights into some of the pressures that are
                    put on institutions. I remember we were working on one project up in Chad. It
                    was a small agricultural project growing tomatoes and green beans. One of those
                    off-season agricultural projects. It was a major French investor who was going
                    to work there. I saw a letter in one of the confidential files from the
                    President of Chad who was named Tombalbaye to the president of the African
                    Development Bank who in those days was a Tunisian named Labidi. He was quite an
                    interesting figure. Mr. Labidi out of Tunisia had been President of the national
                    development bank there. The letter from President Tombalbaye said if you do not
                    finance this project, Chad will pull out of the African Development Bank. These
                    were the kinds of pressures exerted, whether he actually meant it or they were
                    actually going to do that or not is hard to say. You know they make threats like
                    that, but whether they would do it or not is another thing. Another project we
                    worked on was the drainage and sewage of N'Djamena in those days called Fort
                    Lamy. We had an American company which actually went out there and looked at the
                    drainage and sewage problems of Fort Lamy, and eventually did the design of it
                    and I think some of the work was eventually carried out but not all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was part of your function to develop the staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>FELL: I think that was one of the main things, and it's very hard to tell whether
                    that worked out or not. I tried to involve as many African staff as I could in
                    the selection process, in judging, in analyzing the process, in doing the
                    missions, in preparing the terms of reference for all these projects, in taking
                    them through the whole cycle, and eventually bringing them up to the board of
                    directors of the bank itself for financing. Because once we did, the final
                    design we would take whatever feasibility information we had and put it into a
                    package that would be brought up before the board of directors of the bank for
                    financing. I felt that was 50% or more of my job, bringing Africans in and
                    training them on this sort of thing. I think some of them did get a good deal of
                    benefit out of that. I was on the task force in the bank that worked on
                    procedures, on how the bidding procedures for the bank would be, on consultants,
                    and on projects itself. So, some of the experience we got from the USAID grant
                    was fed into that process and actually matured over many years.</p>
                <p>I remember another project I worked on in the bank and eventually one of my close
                    associates and friends in the bank was Babakar N'Ddjaye. Babakar and I used to
                    go on missions together. We were friends. The African Development Bank was being
                    called upon to contribute to the first environmental conference in Stockholm in
                    1971 or 1972. The predecessor of the Rio Conference. It was the first one on the
                    environment. I was told to do some idea work on what the banks position ought to
                    be on this. I took a rather environmentally oriented approach to this saying we
                    ought to look at projects very carefully and see what the environmental impact
                    is and try to look at things from an environmental aspect. I got into an
                    argument with Babakar. He said, “No, we need more smokestacks in Africa. This is
                    what we need. This kind of environmental analysis is going to be very costly and
                    if we are going to catch up, we can't afford to pay for all of this.” Many years
                    later Babakar N'Ddjaye became President of the African Development Bank which is
                    another incredible story. I never thought that would happen because he worked
                    his way right up through the ranks and probably the person I was closest with in
                    the bank and never dreamed he would become President of the bank any more than I
                    would become administrator of USAID. Many years later he called me aside and
                    said, “You know I think when we worked on the Stockholm thing. You and later he
                    said to me, 'You were probably right and I was probably wrong.'" It took him
                    many years for the President of the US to figure that out. Some of these things
                    take a long gestation period.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find living in Ivory Coast?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>FELL: That was probably one of the best things. We loved living in Ivory Coast.
                    It was my first overseas assignment with USAID. I think I reached there about
                    January of 1971. We spent over two years there and we loved it. We loved working
                    in the bank because we had ready-made colleagues and friends and interesting
                    people from all over Africa who were there. From a social aspect it was
                    wonderful. We had a very small apartment, but it was very pleasant overlooking
                    the lagoon. In those days unlike what happened many years later, Abidjan was
                    very safe. You could walk anywhere. We did a little bit of traveling around
                    Ivory Coast and elsewhere. We loved it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of economic developmental in
                        Ivory Coast?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: Well, in those days it was quite promising. I would say from my first
                    contact with Africa I was amazed at how developed it was. There were all the
                    accoutrements of developed life, particularly in Abidjan which is a bustling
                    city. We were talking about what is typical and what is not typical. Certainly
                    it was not a typical city in Africa in those days, because you had a very large
                    contingent of French expatriates who provided a gloss or patina around the city
                    and made it look like it was more advanced than the country really was. Still it
                    was a very promising period. Ivory Coast had played a card of being very close
                    to France and using a lot of French cooperation and technical assistance. There
                    were more French in Ivory Coast then than there had been in colonial days. There
                    were 30-40,000 French there, mostly in Abidjan. You had doctors and architects
                    and lawyers and technicians, all sorts of people and everything worked very
                    well. So I'd say it was a very easy place to live and very safe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get out to the rural areas? What were the living
                        conditions for the African people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: The rural areas didn't look too bad to me in West Africa, and I think a lot
                    of people who traveled around Africa would say that. If you went to villages in
                    many places in West Africa particularly in Ivory Coast, the people were eating
                    quite well; they had good diets, maybe not well-balanced diets but pretty good,
                    enough calories a day. The villages were very clean, in fact probably cleaner
                    than they are now. In those days there weren't so many plastic bags or throwaway
                    stuff. They had their own systems for keeping their villages clean; there was a
                    certain discipline in the villages. I can't say that I was struck by any
                    particular misery that I saw in the villages at that particular time. West
                    Africans tend to dress in very colorful garb and tend to be happy. There always
                    seemed to be some sort of festivity going on. Now it is true on another level if
                    you got deeper in to these things which we and many expatriates don't do, there
                    probably are a lot of things that were missing like malaria and some types of
                    diseases, and also the lack of opportunity for the large mass of people who live
                    in the rural areas who don't have an opportunity for good education.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Assignment to USAID/Cameroon regional office - 1973</p>
                <p>FELL: 1973. I suppose this might be an insight into how USAID operates. The head
                    of the west Africa office in those days was a man named Fermino Spencer whom you
                    remember very well. Fermino Spencer was coming through Abidjan, and I remember
                    sitting on the beach with Fermino. He asked me how do you like your job in the
                    African Development Bank? I said I like it fine. He said would you like to go
                    down to Cameroon and be the number two person in our regional development office
                    in Yaounde? I said I hadn't thought about it very much but I guess I would. That
                    was the way that assignment was cooked up. Next thing you know I got orders
                    saying I was going to Cameroon.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>In those days, as you know probably better than anyone, Haven, we've gone through
                    many cycles as to how the agency operated in Africa. Right after independence in
                    the 60's we started with offices practically all over Africa. Then the 40
                    country limitation was voted in the Foreign Assistance Act so the major
                    assistance countries were parceled out all over the world. It turned out that
                    Africa didn't get very many of them, so we created emphasis missions. Then the
                    rest of Africa which was not going to be an emphasis place was sort of left to
                    float. The justification by which we could operate in those countries was mostly
                    regional. If we were working on a regional basis somehow, it would be OKAY to do
                    projects if there was some sort of a tie-up. It wouldn't be strictly speaking
                    bilateral projects. So for West Africa the configuration that was set up was a
                    regional development office was placed in Dakar, another regional development
                    office was placed in Niamey and another in Yaounde. Each of these regional
                    development offices handled three or four countries around where they were set
                    up. Starting in 1970 what was called the West Africa Capital Development Office
                    and later became the Regional Economic Development Services Office in Abidjan
                    and Nairobi to be service offices and also to be sort of like an accordion to
                    handle places where there wouldn't be any coverage in the Regional Development
                    Offices. So I was assigned to be the number two man in Yaounde starting in 1973.
                    A gentleman named Jack McLaughlin since deceased who had served many years in
                    AID had been heading up that office. Before that we had a major mission in
                    Cameroon for many years, and then it had kind of dwindled down for some reason;
                    I don't know exactly the reason. Well I guess Cameroon had not been an emphasis
                    country. We really didn't have a strictly speaking bilateral program for
                    Cameroon. There were vestiges of what once had been a very large program which
                    USAID, little by little phased out. The major project we had going on in
                    Cameroon was the trans-Cameroon railroad. We were just finishing up. I went to
                    Ngaoundere (in Northern Cameroon) to just do the last big trip to see that the
                    systems were all working just before they were going to inaugurate the project.
                    We had worked very closely. That project had been financed with the FAC (the
                    French Cooperation European Commission) and the European Commission had been
                    sort of the accounting agent for that project. We had let them do the management
                    accounting and control of the project; we provided about a third of the
                    financing for the whole project. It was done in two tranches. One tranche went
                    from Yaounde to Bilbao and from Bilbao it went all the way up to Ngaoundere. We
                    provided the rails for that project from Bethlehem Steel and the culverts for
                    that project which came from ARAMCO. I think we provided some of the Caterpillar
                    and bulldozer equipment which was used by the contractor which was an Italian
                    contracting firm. It was a project of great international cooperation between
                    our agencies. It was one of the major projects where we were working closely
                    with the European Commission and the French.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find that worked? Were there any major
                        issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>FELL: I thought it worked very well. Practically no major issues until we got to
                    the very end of the project. During the day to day operation of the project it
                    worked very well. In fact Al Disdier's Capital Finance Office had a major hand
                    in structuring the way that project had been set up. They insisted that a
                    certain office be set up in the Cameroon Government that was very well staffed
                    for managing and supervising the project, handling the accounting of the project
                    and the actual execution of it. That was a very strong office that had been set
                    up. We worked very closely with the French and the European Commission and had
                    no problems until it came right down to the end. That came about around 1974.
                    The two things I can remember when they inaugurated the railroad. The head of
                    the office was John Koehring. We decided (I don't take major credit, but the
                    idea came to me) that we really ought to contact everyone in USAID who had been
                    involved in this project over the years and let them know this project has been
                    completed and send them something to show they had been part of the project.
                    There had been little medallions that had been made up, little coins with the
                    trans-Cameroon railroad stamped on them and a booklet that had been published.
                    We researched all the files and found maybe 35 people in USAID who had been
                    fairly closely involved at one time or another in the analysis, the design, and
                    the negotiations of the trans-Cameroon railroad. And we sent everybody one of
                    those pamphlets or medallions. We got some very good feedback from that. This is
                    one of the things about working in an agency like ours, you very rarely see the
                    complete cycle of a project. You either see the beginning or you're in the
                    middle of something, or you're winding it up. It is very rare that you see a
                    whole cycle of something or even hear about the end results of what you were
                    doing. I think a lot of people on AID who had worked on this project for many
                    years (this was in 1974 and I think the project had its genesis in the early
                    1960's.) were very happy to hear that it had been successfully completed and
                    what finally happened to it. Another thing that happened, and I have a photo in
                    my files, Haven, we got all the Assistant Administrators from the Africa Bureau
                    up to that time, except maybe Sam Adams, came to Yaound� for the inauguration of
                    the trans-Cameroon railroad. I remember Ed Hutchinson was there; I'm trying to
                    think of the others: Klein. The Ambassador was C. Robert Moore, a wonderful man
                    one of the absolutely most cultured, highly intelligent, extremely wonderful men
                    that I've ever met. We had a picture of all the Assistant Administrators from
                    the Africa Bureau because this had been one of the major capital projects that
                    the Africa Bureau had ever carried out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember the scale of our input?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: Our input, I would hesitate to say what it was, I think it was somewhere in
                    the neighborhood of $30-40 million. Now it doesn't sound like very much but in
                    those days it was a lot of money. I couldn't say what the whole project was; it
                    was done in tranches.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said it went well until the very end.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>FELL: Right to the end and then at the end we got hit with an overrun claim from
                    the Italian contractor. I'm a lawyer and had worked as a lawyer, but I wasn't
                    working as a lawyer any more because I was strictly in an operational capacity
                    as number two man. But, they said look at these claims and tell us what we ought
                    to do about them. I looked at the claims that were set forward by the Italian
                    contractor, and for the life of me I couldn't see how they could have been any
                    weaker. There wasn't one of them that was worth a nickel. One of the reasons why
                    it was fairly easy to come to that conclusion was the office in the Cameroon
                    government that had been managing this had done a superb job of keeping track of
                    everything that had happened, keeping records and everything. I absolutely had a
                    very hard time accepting any of these claims. The French were willing to accept
                    these claims and to pay them, and the European Commission was willing to accept
                    them. They wanted us to accept our pro rata portion of these claims. We found it
                    very hard to recommend, even putting your best foot forward, to accept them. We
                    were wined and dined and waltzed and given a lot of encouragement from the
                    European Commission to come on board. I went to Brussels two or three times.
                    Eventually these claims were sent back to Washington. Since this is kind of an
                    unofficial historical record, I think we came to a conclusion in Washington
                    that, in a way, to buy peace and to show that we were good neighbors and good
                    cooperation we actually got them to reduce the claims considerably and to
                    withdraw a number of them and we kind of stiffened the back of the European
                    Commission and of the French. Eventually I got to know some of the inside people
                    on the European Commission who admitted that this was kind of a game up at the
                    European Commission to do that. But, it wasn't too welcome, the position we were
                    taking up there. I think we eventually took a more flexible position; we agreed
                    to pay maybe up to $1,500,000 of the claim. Putting all that on a pro rata
                    basis, $5 million, I forget what it turned out to be, and the claims were
                    settled. I was sitting there in the room when the deal was struck. The head of
                    the Commission, Mr. Ferandi, who was a giant of a figure in those days in the
                    European Development Fund, and the Italian contractor were sitting there, and
                    they were speaking French for a while, and then all of a sudden they started
                    speaking a language that none of us understood. It turned out it was some
                    Sicilian Italian, and they started waving their hands and the next thing you
                    know, they said okay we're all in agreement. What have you agreed to? No one
                    could understand. They said, Well, we agreed $5,000,000. Everyone paid. We paid
                    our part of it and the project was concluded. Later on , other tranches of that
                    project were done, but I had left Cameroon.</p>
                <p>We had other projects in Cameroon in those days. We had a project with Southern
                    University. Of course USAID since the time of Mr. Hannah (Administrator) had
                    done a lot of things working with different universities and bringing American
                    universities into the USAID program. In Cameroon we had a contract with Southern
                    University to help develop the economic school at the national agricultural
                    college there. We had three American economists that were in Cameroon training,
                    and they were writing articles and teaching in the school. The idea was that
                    better economic analysis would be good for national planning. I think that was a
                    moderately unsuccessful project or moderately successful depending on how one
                    looks at it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: I think that as in many of these university contracts it turned out that
                    instead of getting very high caliber technical cooperation unit, we got people
                    who had been recruited off the street. It wasn't cohesive from the university
                    itself and too much of the contract was spent on the care and feeding of the
                    Americans and the American university and probably not enough on the locals and
                    the local university. I think I saw this in other contracts we did both with
                    universities and consultants. That is one of the lessons that I learned over the
                    years. We tended to think that projects were going well when someone would give
                    us a good briefing in our language, the way we wanted to hear it, and the charts
                    looked like the charts we wanted to see. But, underneath, the local scene was
                    going on. I don't think we were prepared to accept the messiness of the local
                    development system. We wanted it clean-cut and presented to us in our way.</p>
                <p>I'm going to jump ahead just a little bit because when I retired from the USAID,
                    I came to the OECD working on aid reviews. I think one of the most fascinating
                    aid reviews I worked on recently was Switzerland. We did an aid review of
                    Switzerland. We saw a modus operandi that maybe in an idealistic way is kind of
                    how the USAID envisions itself working but we don't really work this way. The
                    way the Swiss were set up in Benin. I went down there and did a field trip. The
                    Swiss, they don't talk about participatory development; they actually do
                    participatory development. I remember when I was first asked to work on the
                    Swiss aid review and having worked 20 years in Africa, if someone had asked me
                    what had the Swiss done in Africa, I would have been stumped, I wouldn't have a
                    clue because I never saw the Swiss. No one ever sees the Swiss because the Swiss
                    are invisible in Africa practically and yet they have quite a sizable program.
                    When I went down to Benin, first of all, you have to find their office which
                    isn't easy because they don't have any big flags or anything around the office.
                    There were no vehicles with Swiss flags painted on them. In fact, they don't
                    allow it. It is illegal for them. They don't want their name on any project;
                    they won't allow their name to be put on any project; they won't allow it. The
                    way they operate, a lot of their projects are set up through what they call
                    small support offices. They will hire local Beninese. Say they are doing an
                    education project. They would hire one or two local Beninese and say, “Here's
                    the work plan,” which they had already worked out together with the local
                    Beninese authorities. Here's the work plan, here's the budget, Go. You work with
                    the local people, talk it out. We will be back in three months to see what
                    you've done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there's no Swiss technical people on the ground?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>FELL: No. The locals do it themselves. The Swiss say let the local people handle
                    it themselves. They get the budget; they have their own procedures; they have
                    their own system. All we want to do is account for the money and account for the
                    results. We'll talk about the methodology. We'll bring people in to talk to you
                    for a week or two if you want any particular help, but we're not going to put
                    technical people on the project; you're going to have to do it yourself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are relatively small projects I suppose.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: Relatively small projects. Right. But, some of them are considerable. Some
                    of them would have a considerable also replicative effect of the type we're
                    trying to get. For instance, a project they were doing was a project in
                    organizing artisans and different types of professional people. For instance,
                    they would get the bakers together and say OKAY how can you improve the
                    standards of the bakers in cleanliness, in training, finance and accounting and
                    work as a group to improve the professional standards of your own profession?
                    They helped them to set up an association. We were talking about being a genius.
                    Well, to set up an association in an African country, you almost need to be one.
                    Few people know how to do it. The project got lawyers and Beninese specialists
                    and they were asked to put this on one sheet of paper. What do you have to do to
                    be legally set up as an association, not have any trouble with the authorities?
                    The project taught the people how they could set up their own association, how
                    you could set up your own little savings and loan association. They set up 50
                    through the Swiss project, 50 of these different types of associations. We
                    probably don't have to go into detail on the Swiss project. I think that their
                    approach of working is very participative, of working very closely with the
                    local society, and of doing things at a pace of the local society. And I know
                    there are other levels of working on policy levels and various things and they
                    work on that level too. And perhaps with a little bit more patience than
                    sometimes I've seen in some USAID. When you are trying to do change, I think you
                    should take a much longer view of things than I've seen in some of the ways
                    USAID has operated. We're much too impatient. We don't do the digging and the
                    background and the talking and the local work in helping the locals find their
                    own solutions which are durable and sustainable over time.</p>
                <p>Anyway back to Cameroon, we had a very small office in Cameroon. There was John
                    Koehring, myself, Glen Slocum, and Larry Berry, I think four of us in that
                    office at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were handling regional projects. What was
                        regional?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>FELL: In addition to the Trans-Cameroon Railroad and a number of projects in
                    Cameroon, we handled Chad. Chad was quite operational in those days of because
                    this is after the Sahel drought, we had a lot of food operations up in Chad. So
                    one of us would go up there on a rotating basis to work on the problems of the
                    drought. We didn't have much of a bilateral program in Chad, but it was mostly
                    food relief. We had a very small regional project in the CAR, Central African
                    Republic, with the regional health organization that operated out of Yaounde. It
                    was a regional organization that operated on the health side. Then we had a very
                    small project in Gabon in Dr. Schweitzer's hospital. We built a wing on the
                    Lambar�n� hospital where Dr. Schweitzer's hospital was in Gabon. But we never
                    found much to do in Gabon. We were theoretically in charge of Equatorial Guinea
                    but at that time there was a madman who was president of Guinea named Garcias
                    Macias. We decided there was very little we could do in Equatorial Guinea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get into the discussion on what constituted a
                        regional project, all the hairsplitting judgments about what was regional
                        and not regional?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: Yes we had that often. As a matter of fact I forgot , we did have a
                    regional project between Chad and Cameroon working in livestock in northern
                    Cameroon and northern Chad which was also a cooperative project with the French,
                    working with the Lake Chad Basin Commission which was a regional organization.
                    In those days we tried to work with local African organizations, one of which
                    was the Lake Chad Basin Commission. These were unstable organizations in some
                    respects. We never were sure that their payments were coming in form their
                    member governments and were maintained by technical cooperation coming in from
                    the outside. The French were helping; we were helping; others were helping.
                    There were basically many difficult to reconcile differences between members of
                    the Lake Chad Basin Commission. Ours was a livestock project, and we had both
                    French and American people in technical cooperation on that project trying to
                    introduce improved grazing practices and better marketing practices in that
                    area. I think it was a moderately successful project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you were there not too long at that time I
                        guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: Two years. Then I moved to Senegal in 1975 which was a regional office, but
                    we were in a period of transferring into a USAID mission in Senegal at that
                    time. Offices had been set up in Mali and Mauritania.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember the contexts of why these changes were
                        coming up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Move to the USAID mission in Senegal - 1975</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>FELL: The context mainly in West Africa was the Sahel drought. The 40 country
                    limitation had less impact because we had pulled out of a lot of countries that
                    had previously been emphasis countries around the world, and that didn't pose
                    much of a problem anymore. We were beginning to return to bilateral programs in
                    Africa. We set up offices in Mauritania and in Mali which had previously been a
                    part of this regional development office jurisdiction. When I arrived there in
                    Dakar in 1975, our office was only in charge of Gambia and Guinea. The other
                    countries had their own offices and they reported directly to Washington, and
                    were getting like we were , technical assistance from the REDSO in Abidjan. So
                    if we needed a lawyer or engineer or economist any technical help in devising
                    projects on a first basis we would get it from the regional office in
                    Abidjan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your position in the mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: I was the Deputy Director there. The director was Norman Schoonover who, we
                    could definitely say, was an old hand in AID going back to the Marshall Plan
                    days. He started here in France probably in the 1950's. He had extensive
                    experience. Also, like Al Disdier was one of the rare people in AID who was
                    totally fluent in French. He spoke perfectly fluent French and was an
                    extraordinarily good writer and was good at putting together project papers. In
                    those days we were sort of building up our program in Senegal. We had one major
                    project in the Sine Saloum area. It was an agricultural extension project where
                    we were working closely with the French, in fact we were financing a lot of
                    French technical assistance in that particular project in what they called the
                    groundnut basin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was financing French technical assistance proper at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: No. I don't think there was any particular restriction that prevented us
                    from doing it. I think we bought into a whole agricultural extension program in
                    the Sine Saloum particularly the cereals aspect of it. We paid a portion of the
                    cost of that agricultural extension project which included some French technical
                    assistance. In fact in Cameroon, we were paying for some French technical
                    assistance when I was down there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this the fact that we couldn't provide people with
                        punch?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>FELL: We either couldn't produce people or we were being cooperative in many
                    local places. I remember at one point, I forgot a major project we did in
                    Cameroon, the CUSS, The University Center for Health Teaching. We agreed with
                    the French that whoever won the bid, we would go in 50-50 in the actual
                    construction of the building itself of the university health training center. As
                    it happened a French company won it and so we paid for half the cost of
                    constructing that building. There have been many cases where we have done that.
                    I saw many in my experience. I didn't see many going the other way where
                    Americans were being financed by the French. That was much rarer if at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Senegal what was the strategy that was emerging at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: I have to go back to something. I don't think in those days and I'm talking
                    about in 1975, we looked at things at least in West Africa, from a policy
                    standpoint. We were not looking at things from a policy or regional development
                    standpoint, and we didn't realize or think that we would be able to have much
                    influence on the actual policies of the countries themselves. We didn't realize
                    many of the policies like the monetary policy, the agricultural policies, the
                    input policies, and the pricing policies which were very statist and state
                    oriented, that we would have any influence on those. If we had thought we would,
                    I don't think we'd even have tried it. We thought more in terms of transferring
                    technical knowledge and improved methods somehow. I think experience showed that
                    many of these projects were destined to fail because they were in a sea of
                    policy ambiance that wouldn't be conducive to the success of the projects
                    themselves. I think we came to that realization maybe 10 years later. But at
                    that time we looked at Senegal and saw food problems, and health problems, which
                    were the main issues. If we were looking at food problems we saw three major
                    centers. That is: 1) the fleuve area in the northern part of the Senegal River
                    basin area where big doings were beginning to take place. Studies were being
                    done as to what could be done to develop the Senegal River basin; 2) in the Sine
                    Saloum area which was the groundnut basin area and what could be done to improve
                    practices because people were worried about land degradation, peanuts wearing
                    down the soil and all this; 3) in the Casamance area which is the southern part
                    of Senegal which was potentially a rich area and also a rice growing area. We
                    thought that a lot could be done to improve rice production. Looking back on
                    this I think we were a little starry eyed about a lot of these things. We didn't
                    think we would have influence on the government on the policy level, so we just
                    thought we would work on the technical aspects of it. I'm not sure we posed
                    ourselves that question. In the Senegal River basin, we were wrestling with the
                    question of whether USAID would come in on the infrastructure or not. At this
                    time in USAID we were drawing back from the whole idea of infrastructure.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>I'd say in the 1960's we'd done a lot of infrastructure, we'd done a lot of
                    transportation. You look around Africa. We'd done Ibadan water supply in
                    Nigeria, we'd done the Chisamayo Port in Somalia, we'd done the Trans-Cameroon
                    railroad, and projects all over Africa. We had quite a strong office for doing
                    that in the Capital Development Finance Office. That office had finally been
                    abolished; many of the engineers had been let go. A lot of the techniques and
                    capability of doing infrastructure were lost from the agency and the idea of
                    basic human needs came into the legislation in 1973-1974. The agency moved away
                    from some of the infrastructure type projects we'd been doing. We began to do
                    more grassroots type work. We were not talking about policy there as much as
                    trying to affect the daily lives of people. Even this, now in looking at it, was
                    through rosy colored glasses. Affecting daily lives of people. We can't work
                    with every individual artisan. Even the types of projects we were doing were
                    destined not to have a very major impact on the societies or countries where we
                    were working.</p>
                <p>That was the way things were going. We lost that infrastructure capability in the
                    agency. We were wrestling with this question in the Senegal River basin because
                    those were major infrastructure projects. Basically the idea of it was there
                    would be two dams built on the Senegal River. To make a long story short, we
                    finally concluded that USAID would not contribute to the infrastructure itself.
                    Since the infrastructure was going to go forward anyway, and the French were
                    going to build the dam at the mouth of the Senegal River called the Diama Dam, a
                    major project, and Germany would finance a dam at a place called Manantali in
                    Mali, another major dam, we wouldn't be involved in those dam projects, but we
                    would help with the river basin authority doing agricultural research for the
                    projects that would justify this major infrastructure.Also we agreed, and this
                    was a very important thing to do, probably the first environmental impact study
                    of a major river basin development that was ever done. We eventually hired a
                    firm called Gannett and Fleming, an American company, that did quite a sizable
                    environmental impact study of the river basin. Probably more important than the
                    result of that study itself was the fact that we did such a study. We sort of
                    staked out the fact that before you do a major river basin or major
                    infrastructure you ought to look at it from the environmental standpoint.
                    Whether they had the techniques or the state of the art or even the political
                    power to get any of the ideas into the design or the way the project operated,
                    I'm a little dubious it really took place. But it certainly staked out the fact
                    that sort of activity ought to take place. At that point another office had been
                    set up, sort of an appendage of the USAID Dakar. It was an office to work only
                    with the Senegal River Basin Authority, the OMVS office that was set up by Harry
                    Petrequin who led that office. I think Glen Slocum eventually came in and worked
                    in that office and had several people. They were independent of the USAID
                    Senegal. We did a major study of one of the irrigation perimeters up there
                    called MATAM. That was done by Bechtel, but the project was never financed. That
                    office was eventually abolished and folded in to the USAID.</p>

                <p>FELL: I don't think we, being realistic, had very grand visions. I think we
                    looked at ourselves as a secondary donor, a minor donor compared to the European
                    Development Fund or to the French, who had much more of a stake in what was
                    going on in Senegal. After I left Senegal in 1978, the mission grew considerably
                    and the program grew considerably. It would be for others to determine if that
                    was wise or not wise, or if it were a good investment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was later that it began to grow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: Our budgets in those days for Senegal were on the level of $5-6,000,000 a
                    year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other significant activities that you worked
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: We developed a program for the Casamance in those days. I remember Norm
                    Schoonover was down there and tried to figure out what to do in this Casamance.
                    There wasn't an obvious answer to this question, because we had sort of
                    conflicting opinions as to what could be done in the Casamance. You had water;
                    there was a lot of salt intrusion, and the locals had their own little systems
                    for dealing with the salt intrusion for growing rice in those areas. And we were
                    getting as many, and you've probably seen this in development projects,
                    conflicting opinions from experts on what could be done, and what should be
                    done. We eventually thought there were things to be done in the Casamance that
                    could improve rice growing. Frankly I don't know what the end result of that
                    project is. I think we did a $20-25,000,000 project in the Casamance. It started
                    very slowly with studies looking at it. We'd just planted the seeds for studying
                    these various projects when I left. I don't know whether it had paid out or not.
                    I think that one opinion was that the farmers had figured out a pretty good
                    technique for doing things themselves and that we weren't really going to add
                    much unless we could really find much improved seeds and a much improved
                    technology package. This was one of the big things that was going on.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>When I think of things that consumed our time in those days, we had a project
                    going on with the West African Rice Development Agency in Liberia, WARDA. Their
                    teams would come in and come out and come in and come out, much of it financed
                    by USAID. This was one of the major conundrums of West African development that
                    local consumption of food was veering towards rice and wheat particularly in the
                    cities, and the local production was based on sorghum and millet. Since all
                    these other products had to be imported, what could you do about it? You could
                    try to wet down consumption so there wouldn't be so much import. You could also
                    try to work on the production side of it. Was there a way of producing rice
                    cheaper in West Africa to feed the local market. That was the reason why the
                    Senegal River basin project was somewhat appealing, that there would be possibly
                    irrigated rice projects for local consumption. Now this is a major question of
                    West African development. Probably looking back on it now it was not the center
                    of the universe. I think now we are coming around to it. We are getting off in
                    to philosophy a little bit. The problem now is you've got to go back to
                    comparative government 101 and economics 101 maybe. The way the governments are
                    managed and the participation of the governments themselves, whether the people
                    really have a stake in them, whether the judicial systems are operating well,
                    whether things are more transparent, and just the whole governmental apparatus
                    and political system, how that was operating, really turns out, I think, to be
                    more important than we thought it was. These other things will all fall into
                    place eventually if the political systems are functioning better and there's
                    less corruption, there's more transparency, and more democratic participation.
                    We see countries with a lot of natural resources and maybe some technical
                    capability that don't do very well at all because they just don't attract
                    investment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the government environment in Senegal not
                        conducive to development?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>FELL: I think in many respects it was not conducive to development because
                    Senegal was an appendage of French West Africa that had atrophied. Originally
                    the administration was set up to sort of administer all of French West Africa,
                    and then it reduced back to Dakar, and there was sort of the illusion of
                    grandeur, and you had a large administration. Many of the technical people
                    didn't want to go out in the countryside and work. And I think we had a lot of
                    the thing we hate to mention, the “C” word, the corruption word. Low and high
                    level corruption at all different levels and political deviations. Good
                    intentions getting politically deviated. I remember a World Bank project that a
                    friend of mine was working on. A very close friend of mine, one of the closest
                    friends I had in Senegal. We were discussing internal rates of return and why
                    projects didn't bring in their projected return. The World Bank had done a very
                    careful study with the segments of roads that would have the highest rates of
                    return, what should be done and what shouldn't be done and what should be
                    upgraded. Finally, when it came down to it and they actually did the work, none
                    of those segments were financed, but other segments were financed for different
                    reasons. Because some Marabou wanted the road paved to his house, and someone
                    else wanted it paved to his village. So none of the economic analysis meant
                    anything. I knew another project that had been managed by another close friend
                    of mine. It happened to be another World Bank project which was an appealing
                    idea to begin with, which was trying to take school leavers and give them
                    vocational training. There had been many attempts at this kind of thing in West
                    Africa. This is one that was attempted in Senegal in those days, was for middle
                    level practical vocational training. Here again when you start pulling the
                    cabbage leaves apart you find out there was a lot of deviation of project design
                    from what it was originally designed to do. The centers were not put where they
                    should have been located. There were gasoline coupons that were missing, and
                    there was a lot of mismanagement and things like this, which disrupted the
                    program which eventually collapsed and never succeeded. Yet the idea seems very
                    appealing, take school leavers and give them vocational training. Yet these
                    projects just didn't work because they got deviated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said you had a health project there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>FELL: We had a health project that was another major activity we worked on. This
                    was another thing that was the bane of USAID. Some of our projects seemed to be
                    so far away. This was a project out almost to the Mali border in a place called
                    Bakel which was a livestock project and a health project. It turned out that the
                    livestock project was moderately successful, trying to improve the grazing. Here
                    again we found that the grazers in West Africa knew a lot more than we gave them
                    credit for knowing. We thought we would bring in western United States grazing
                    techniques and ideas. Years later we learned that they actually knew a lot more
                    than we gave them credit for and weren't doing so badly after all. I think we
                    brought some minor improvements to the grazing practices in that particular
                    area. And from the health standpoint, we tried to do a primary health project in
                    the villages because we were introducing some irrigation to the Senegal River
                    basin which was one of the justifications for doing this major infrastructure on
                    the Senegal River basin. I think we were moderately successful in bringing
                    improved irrigation practices in those villages which hadn't done irrigation.
                    But as one of our irrigation experts told us, it takes several generations of
                    irrigation farmers to get up to snuff in really learning the cycles of
                    irrigation. Those projects were long gestation type of projects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you had a health project?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: We had a health project to go along with it. Part of the environmental
                    things and working on the malaria aspect. Knowing that there was going to be
                    irrigation, you were going to have more malaria, more health problems related to
                    the irrigation project. We brought that element into the project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did you have projects situated so far away?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: I think part of it was that you were supposed to work with poorer people.
                    Poorer people tended to be farther away from the capital city. I forgot to
                    mention this, Haven. Probably one of the first major primary health care
                    projects in West Africa was the Sine Saloum project. We were working on primary
                    health care projects at the local level. And like many of these primary health
                    care projects they tended to get sabotaged by the policies because when you go
                    to the ministry of health you find out that the money would be going to the
                    hospitals in the central cities. Or some other donor, in this case the Germans,
                    came in and built a big hospital a 200-300 bed hospital in one of the major
                    cities and drained away the resources that would have otherwise been available
                    for the primary health care project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the primary impediment to making the rural health
                        care project function was the lack of resources?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>FELL: I think that lack of concentration from the ministry and lack of priority
                    given to it. We tried some things, some techniques. I remember one of them that
                    was sort of half my idea, didn't work. We were trying to figure out how can you
                    get these local supervisors to be mobile. You see in projects the first thing
                    they want are cars and vehicles. If you have vehicles the first thing you have
                    is maintenance costs and gasoline costs and the price of the project starts
                    spiraling. We said how do people get around here locally. They got around by
                    horse and buggy, so we said the project will finance horses and buggies. I
                    remember later on an evaluation was made of the project. This was a plausible
                    idea to begin with but in practice it didn't work out I heard later. I had left
                    the mission after that.</p>
                <p>At the creation of the Sahel Development Program - 1973</p>
                <p>I guess I'm going to have to jump ahead. Following the Sahel drought, a major
                    effort was made to bring together a consortium of donors to train themselves on
                    the problems of the Sahel and see if there couldn't be some sort of concerted
                    action on the international level to prevent anything like that from ever
                    happening again and trying to improve the development prospects for West Africa.
                    The major players involved in this in addition to yourself, Haven, and Sam Adams
                    in those days was David Shear who was head of the office for West Africa and Roy
                    Stacy who had helped to create what was eventually called the Club du Sahel, a
                    secretariat based in the OECD to work with the donors and help with an
                    organization based in the Sahel in Ouagadougou, the Interstate Committee to
                    Fight Drought which had been set up by the Sahelians themselves. I forgot to
                    mention one of the things I had done. The person in USAID who was put in charge
                    of the drought in 1973, the Deputy Administrator of AID, was Maury Williams who
                    was a gigantic figure in those days. At one point he decided he wanted to make a
                    tour of that area. They said: who's going to go with him? I hope he's not going
                    to be listening to this. He was known to be a person who was rather demanding
                    you might say. He'd like things done when he wanted them done and he was
                    persuasive in getting his points across. They called me up down in Cameroon and
                    said: Art, get on a plane. You are going to go to Paris and meet up with Maury
                    Williams.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Cameroon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: I was in Cameroon at the time. They said, take him around the Sahel. Show
                    him everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was before you had been to the Sahel I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: Well I had been in the African Development Bank before so I had worked
                    around the Sahel.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course! You knew the area a little bit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: I knew the area somewhat. That was almost a defining moment in my career,
                    because that could have been the end of my career. It turned out not to be. I
                    met Maury Williams up in Paris. I remember we went out to old Bourget airport
                    when it used to be. We met there and sat down and had something to eat and said
                    what are we going to do about the travel plans and got on the plane and went to
                    Africa. We traveled around together for three weeks I guess. He was out there
                    for quite a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was what at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: He was Deputy Administrator of AID It was amazing he spent that long out
                    there. If I can remember where we went. As a matter of fact I have a record of
                    this. I kept day to day notes of where we went. Memos of all the conversations.
                    I've got all these in my files. We went to Niamey and visited the refugee camps
                    there. We went to Mali and visited the refugee camps to Timbuktu.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was still at the time of the drought.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: Still the drought. It was in 1973 at the peak of the drought.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was on a Presidential mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: Right. I interpreted for him. We met the Presidents of all those countries.
                    Maury Williams actually understood quite a bit of French and was amazingly good,
                    but he didn't speak French and didn't want to speak it and so I was his
                    interpreter. We went to Ouagadougou because they were setting up the CILSS. That
                    was the inaugural meeting of the CILSS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>FELL: The Interstate Committee to Combat Drought in the Sahel which was a
                    grouping of the eight countries, the Sahel countries of West Africa to band
                    together and try and get some joint planning and joint agreements on what they
                    could do about the drought, improve agricultural production, and improve their
                    own food security. I remember we met with President Senghor and I interpreted
                    for Mr. Williams about what the United States might do in the Sahel with the
                    head of the CILSS, Mr. Dakoure, who was minister of agriculture and quite a
                    gigantic figure in those days in Ouagadougou, sort of a key figure in setting up
                    the CILSS. We met with President Traore in Mali. We eventually went to Chad and
                    met with Mr. Tombalbaye. We got along very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your impressions of these presidents? What was
                        the picture you were getting from their perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: I should mention President Lamizana in Ouagadougou in Upper Volta. Actually
                    Mr. Williams gave me the clue on how to analyze some of these things. President
                    Senghor was exceptionally erudite. Being individuals it was hard to generalize.
                    Of course Senghor was a towering figure, quite an intellectual figure and a very
                    brilliant man. He is in the Academie Fran�aise now. Even today he is one of the
                    most well-spoken Frenchmen in the world. If you can say he is a Frenchman. He is
                    a Frenchman I guess. He gave a very poised overview of everything. He was very
                    anxious that we do a lot for the poorer countries, particularly Chad. He wanted
                    to see the whole region sort of move forward together. He had a real vision, a
                    very wide perspective and long term perspective of this. He realized it would be
                    a long term effort. I think some of the other presidents we met were under
                    stress, and Mr. Williams pointed this out. He said in effect: these are almost
                    desperate men. He said their governments are under tremendous stress. I'd be
                    surprised if many of their governments are there a few years from now. He was
                    quite right in saying that and not long after a number of those governments
                    fell.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you all perceive that this stress was there?
                        Because of the drought?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>FELL: The drought was bringing to fore many of the local problems they were
                    having. Naturally any time anything goes bad, people blame it on the government,
                    whether they're right or whether they're wrong. These governments had very
                    little to do with the fact that these droughts were taking place; it was a
                    natural catastrophe. But also the way the drought was handled and their
                    aftermath showed how they were donor driven. I mean when you saw trucks it was
                    the US financed trucks, it was Belgian trucks. Belgian workers, US workers,
                    French workers. Governments were almost impotent in a way to do anything about
                    the drought themselves. Sam Adams always used to say, “How are the people coping
                    out there?” People had coped to the extent that they coped. Probably 100,000 had
                    died. They lost a lot of herds. And were just invisibly out there in the country
                    where no one could see them having a lot of trouble. Or where they were reaching
                    feeding or refugee centers, you saw a lot of expatriate work going on trying to
                    do something about it. It probably showed up a lot of the central government's
                    impotence in being able to deal with a catastrophe of this magnitude. I'm sure
                    that put them under a lot of stress in addition to other things. And then you
                    saw some of the nasty little problems that come up. In the height of the
                    drought, the wife of the President of Niger was playing games and whether this
                    was low level corruption or high level corruption, the rumors move about very
                    fast, and people lose confidence in the leaders fast. I mean people are starving
                    and they think that the leader's wife is doing something wrong. In Chad, I
                    remember, we had trouble even getting some of the food through customs agents in
                    Chad who were holding up food. These things get known very fast. They caused a
                    lot of trouble and eventually Tombalbaye was killed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This trip with Maury, what did you generally learn from
                        it? What was the conclusion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: I think the conclusion was that there was a lot of unity to the problems
                    that all these countries were facing. That they were very much the same type of
                    problems, and maybe we were naive about it but there was some technology that we
                    could bring to bear that could improve things in agricultural packages, improved
                    practices, improved grazing practices more forestry. Also there was an
                    international cooperation that had taken place on the international level in the
                    emergency relief operations and the aftermath of the drought, and why not try to
                    build on that and build some international cooperative framework where the
                    donors are working together and not at cross purposes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did that idea start?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>FELL: The germ of that idea came out of USAID itself. I think that is one of the
                    strong things that come out of USAID. It was an idea that practically speaking
                    we could contribute toward setting up some sort of a cooperative arrangement
                    with the other donors to work on a big “project” or program we would call it for
                    West Africa. Well, you, Haven, were involved in this. Not only you but Don
                    Brown, Sam Adams, and David Schear were the people that had this idea. They also
                    were looking at it with an eye to our Congressional aspect - how could you show
                    our Congress that we were going to try to do something new, innovative with
                    other donors in a international framework for a very poor region in Africa.</p>
                <p>Basic human need was big in these days; working with the poorest people. These
                    were the people that really had been hit hard so maybe the United States ought
                    to be there showing we can do something. It was a thoughtful idea that we could
                    try to work together in an international way with the other donors. That's where
                    we got in touch with the OECD. Maury Williams since that time had become
                    chairman of the DAC and of course was well aware of what had happened in the
                    Sahel because he made these trips and had been the President's coordinator for
                    the drought in the early 70's. He sounded out the French, who would be a key in
                    doing anything in West Africa and also other donors who were sitting around the
                    Development Assistance Committee, which was a discussion body in the OECD for
                    development, and found that there was generally agreement except for Germany to
                    do something. The Germans didn't like the idea. He was very savvy in getting
                    around this one way or another. A major person in the Secretariat was Anne de
                    Lattre, who was interested in getting involved in this area and had a long
                    standing interest in Africa. We loaned Roy Stacy, one of our most talented
                    officers to work with Anne de Lattre sounding out the Africans themselves and
                    working with the donors and setting up a small secretariat in the OECD that
                    would help work with the Sahelians and the interstate organization in
                    Ouagadougou to develop plans, to do joint work, and joint planning and approve
                    projects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was sort of unusual for the OECD wasn't it? Why would
                        they agree to do something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>FELL: Very unusual. They agreed to it because it was slipped through in an almost
                    surreptitious way through the DAC. Maury Williams had a meeting in the DAC. He
                    interpreted that meeting as giving him a mandate in his personal capacity as
                    Chairman of the DAC to negotiate this thing. The Secretary General of the OECD
                    showed his flexibility in permitting this appendage or little unit if you will
                    to be set outside of the budget of the OECD. As long as it was not financed by
                    the OECD itself but financed by the donors, he said well it is not part 1 part
                    of the core budget, but part 2, part of the budget. No one was really able to
                    raise an objection against it, so it went forward because there were enough
                    players on the inside, like Mr. Williams, Anne de Lattre, Roy Stacy, our
                    agencies, and on the French side they were willing to make the contributions.
                    Some of the other donors came forth, the Dutch were very interested in seeing
                    this go forward. The Swiss were very interested, because they wanted to see this
                    in some sort of a broader regional framework, it fit in with their development
                    plans. It just so happens that there were enough donors who saw this as an
                    interesting program to get involved in, that it all jelled and came together.
                    The financing was available for this framework.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Everybody but the Germans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: The Germans sat on the sideline sucking their thumb and didn't like it.
                    Eventually, grudgingly, they came on board. But much later. Today there is a
                    German technical person on the Secretariat of Club du Sahel in Paris, but it
                    took them 20 years to come to this. However, they actually did provide
                    assistance to the CILSS which was more important than providing it to the Club
                    du Sahel Secretariat. The way this was set up was we had this very small unit...
                    Oh I forgot to mention the Canadians, My God how could I have forgotten the
                    Canadians? The Canadians were major promoters of the Club du Sahel. Incidentally
                    it just so happened how I had gotten involved in some of this, the first meeting
                    of the Club du Sahel was held in Dakar hosted by President Senghor, and
                    President of Mauritania, Ould Daddah, we met at the time. They presided over the
                    whole session there. I remember Don Brown came, The Secretary General of the
                    OECD was there. We, the USAID mission, helped to host and organize, and set up
                    that first meeting of the Club du Sahel which was held in Dakar in 1975.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when you were in Senegal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: When I was in Senegal, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were in on this early part?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>FELL: Yes I happened to be with Maury Williams in Ouagadougou in the setting up
                    of the CILSS, I was at the very first meeting of the Club du Sahel in Dakar.
                    Eventually, when Roy Stacy rotated out of Paris, he was made head of development
                    planning in Washington. I replaced him in the Club du Sahel Secretariat. I
                    stayed here for several years, spent a lot of time in Ouagadougou or all the
                    Sahel countries working with the Club du Sahel's framework.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened at this first meeting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: The principal event was that the partnership between the donors, mainly
                    represented by the OECD donors, and the CILSS, the interstate committee was
                    sealed, and they made a resolution, the Dakar resolution that they would work
                    together within this club which included both the Sahelians and the OECD donors
                    and any other donors that wanted to get involved including the African
                    Development Bank, the World Bank and others, to get involved in this planning
                    and programming their effort, and trying to understand better what the problems
                    were in West Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any issues that were addressed during that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: I think the main issue was that the Sahelians were leery that this would
                    become donor driven. They wanted to make sure that their organization was in the
                    drivers seat., and that it wouldn't be taken over by the donors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any issue about the Sahelians cooperating
                        together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: I think at that particular moment, there weren't any burning issues between
                    the governments that divided them tremendously. Later on, I think some of these
                    issues came to the front. Little problems between Upper Volta and Mali, maybe
                    there was a small war that had taken place but generally speaking I think the
                    Sahelians had quite lucidly seen the value of doing work and cooperation. I
                    think that Mr. Dakour� (Minister of Agriculture of Upper Volta) and President
                    Senghor (of Senegal) had talked to many of them saying: look our best chance in
                    getting a major effort in this is to show that we have some cohesion, and we're
                    going to work together in this. If we don't work together , we'll hang
                    separately as we say, so I think this message got across, and they were trying
                    to show a fairly united front. I think their major worry was that it would
                    become too donor driven. I think that it did become too donor driven at times.
                    It shows that oftentimes our recipient countries are more lucid in seeing some
                    of the problems and that we don't see them quite so clearly. Also there had been
                    a lot of background studies about what could be done about the Sahel about
                    reaching better food security. That was major objective in setting the
                    objectives, what would be the objective? The objective was food self-sufficiency
                    which was a watchword for saying improved self-reliance in food production.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was strictly food related?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: It was mainly food related, but it included the environmental aspects of
                    the drought and to combat the drought and the encroachment of the drought, and
                    improved land practices so that environment was a part of the analysis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a clear strategy for the Sahel program at that
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: I think there was a clearer strategy than we thought. The strategy we
                    thought was there would be technical packages that would be very performing, and
                    we were optimistic that a lot more irrigated land would go into production and
                    provide more security in a zone that had very erratic rainfall. That was the
                    major thing. We were operating against some of the most difficult parameters:
                    low rainfall, erratic rainfall. Those are difficult parameters to operate
                    against to try to get more secure food production. We probably under estimated
                    the number of years it takes to develop that capacity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sense did you have of the capacity for the Sahelian
                        countries to carry out a program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: On a very surface level we were impressed by some very fine individuals.
                    Sometimes we tend to generalize from these individuals and think that there are
                    more there than there are. In fact there was not enough technical capacity to
                    carry a lot of these programs out. It was a much longer term effort than we ever
                    thought it would be. It is still going on. There was another aspect that the
                    Club du Sahel got involved in, which had a spin-off that had immense importance,
                    that had been neglected. For the first time, and this was initiated by USAID, we
                    looked at policy instead of just looking at technical aspects. As a stroke of
                    genius, we brought in CRED the Center for Research in Economic Development from
                    the University of Michigan which happened to be headed up by a very ambitious
                    strong economist named Elliot Berg. Elliot Berg got involved in a study that was
                    launched by AID but funded through the Club du Sahel network with the French
                    playing a very minor role in it which was Cereal Policy in West Africa. It
                    turned out to be a landmark study, because he basically said a lot of these
                    projects don't matter if your pricing policies and your input policies are not
                    good, and if there is not a more liberal approach to the way marketing of
                    cereals is done and more information given to farmers and a whole lot of other
                    things related to policy. If these policy problems are not addressed, none of
                    the projects are going to work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was this perceived by the Sahelians?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>FELL: Not very well. Up to that time it was not considered fair game for us to
                    comment on their cereals policy because that was internal. It was almost like a
                    sovereign domain. It was like saying we're going to come in and work on your
                    judicial system or your department of interior government system and get into
                    the inner workings of your own government. They didn't like it very much.
                    Eventually it was put on the table in working groups. I think that if this had
                    been done in the wrong way it could have fallen completely flat, but luckily the
                    Sahel network was set up in such a way that even an idea like this was able to
                    be put on the table; people were able to read it; it was able to get some kind
                    of discussion and sort of took on a life of its own as certain of these things
                    do. It became part of the agenda of the club to work on that issue. Another
                    issue that was raised in those days that was a ground breaking issue was the
                    question of recurrent costs. I think this came out of Washington and USAID, one
                    of the many good ideas that came out of USAID. The idea was that a lot of new
                    projects were going to be started up; the donors were starting to take renewed
                    interest in the Sahel. The Dutch and Swiss were increasing their programs. The
                    Italians were beginning to gear up. The French, I don't think they were
                    increasing their program, but were cooperating more with the other donors at
                    least in talking within the club network. The US had been able to develop the
                    Sahel Development program through the Club du Sahel network, and the fact that
                    it even got into legislation that we were doing this, we were able to increase
                    our budgets. The Canadians had increased their budget. There were more projects.
                    We became worried that if these projects were not well thought out and the
                    recurrent costs of these projects were not taken into account, what we now call
                    the sustainability of these projects would be doubtful. They are all going to
                    end up fighting for central resources that are not going to be there. This was
                    capsulized in the idea of recurrent costs. So we asked HIID, Harvard Institute
                    for International Development, to look at this issue. We were absolutely
                    dumbfounded when the results came in. They studied dozens of projects for the
                    World Bank, the African Development Bank, USAID, other donors, and did a major
                    study. They found that almost none of these projects addressed this issue. That
                    even the World Bank in all its majesty had neglected to think about not only
                    recurrent costs in their own projects but the cumulative effect of looking at it
                    from a program standpoint when projects were over, how are these going to be
                    maintained? What's going to happen; where are the national budgets going to come
                    up with resources to maintain some of these things? Whether it be infrastructure
                    or software or whatever. This concept of studying recurrent costs wormed its way
                    in to a lot of projects and had a spread effect of immense proportions in the
                    way we look at development and has threaded its way through development
                    planning. The other way that cereals project had a big effect was the World Bank
                    had seen it and said this is really important stuff, so they hired Elliot Berg
                    who had been our economist working on it, to do the first major study of
                    sustainability in Africa and in general which eventually set policy in the World
                    Bank for the next two decades.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the eventual outcome of the cereals policy? What
                        do you understand happened to it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>FELL: Well, it became a major issue and I think it eventually led, over a period
                    of many years, to the structural adjustment agenda. It got into the discussions
                    of the reform agenda that was picked up in structural adjustment. It was one of
                    the major items of discussion and dialogue that was put into structural
                    adjustment. Eventually many of these policies were changed or completely
                    amended. So the seeds were set by some of this work that was done at the early
                    days of the Club du Sahel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did anybody make any change at the time or was it longer
                        term?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: In the short term I don't think there were major changes made. We were
                    still thinking within a state operated system whereby you had state operated
                    warehouses, state operated marketing boards and agencies. But within five to
                    seven years many of those had collapsed because the donors began to withhold
                    financing for them. That might have been a not very visible effect of what
                    caused the collapse of some of those marketing boards. They also imploded from
                    their own inefficiencies, became bankrupt or just inoperative. So just by the
                    sheer fact of the way things were operating, the cereals policies couldn't be
                    continued. A lot of them were changed; import policies were changed. But I still
                    see rearguard actions going on of even donors supporting these state operated
                    marketing boards. Inefficient operations like that still exist. But major
                    changes in liberalizing the practices in West Africa have taken place. I think
                    that many of those would not have happened, had those discussions not begun at
                    that time in the late '70s.</p>
                <p>I stayed at the Club du Sahel to 1983 and worked on environment, and forestry
                    programs, among others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You started at the Club du Sahel when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: 1978 and I left in 1983 and went to Kenya as the Deputy Director of the
                    REDSO office in Nairobi.</p>
                <p>Deputy Director of the USAID Regional Economic Development Office in Kenya -
                    1983</p>

                        cover. Why don't we leave that now because that is something you could add
                        on your own. Let's go on and finish out Kenya.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: Incidentally, when you say a career, I actually never considered myself in
                    a career. I considered myself in a series of jobs in AID or a profession, maybe.
                    It is sort of like sinking into the ooze; I eventually was caught up into
                    it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FELL: Anyway, a colleague of mine who worked in West Africa, Peter Bloom, was
                    Deputy Director of REDSO in the early 80's. The Director at that time was my old
                    colleague from Cameroon, John Koehring, who was the director of REDSO, which was
                    a service operation based in Nairobi. It had survived from the early days
                    probably having been set up by John Withers in the early 1970's. The other
                    office on the other side had originally been set up by Don Gardner, and then
                    David Shear became the Director. The REDSO/Nairobi handled East Africa from
                    Ethiopia all the way down to South Africa and had programming responsibilities
                    for the Indian Ocean countries including Madagascar, Comoros, and the
                    Seychelles, and Mauritius. It was one of the larger offices in Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How large was it roughly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: I think we had about 25 or 30 direct hire in the REDSO/Nairobi itself. The
                    Kenya complex was a very big complex, probably the largest complex in Africa,
                    because we had a regional finance office there that did the accounting for
                    almost all the missions in East Africa. We had a RHUDO office, a housing office,
                    there with three or four direct hires. We had a Kenya mission which was quite a
                    large mission, 25 or 30 people. All together we had about 70 US direct hire
                    based in Kenya at that time. We were all in one building, and REDSO occupied a
                    couple floors of that building. We were under the management of the Kenya
                    Mission which did the administration for that mission. I think Charles Gladson
                    was Mission Director at that time when I first arrived. Barry Reilly who was a
                    colleague of yours in earlier years in Ghana or Nigeria was the Deputy Director
                    of the Kenya mission. Anyway I replaced Peter Bloom as Deputy Director of REDSO,
                    and John Koehring was the Director. We provided technical services to all the
                    missions in West, in East Africa, and as I say managed those programs for those
                    four Indian Ocean countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your specific function?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: My specific function was an alter ego. I absolutely did everything John
                    Koehring did when he wasn't there. John liked to do things hands on. He liked to
                    see things and get involved in the field a lot. He would travel a considerable
                    amount, and I would travel a considerable amount, so we just alternated being in
                    charge of the office so when he wasn't there I would do whatever needed to be
                    done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what were some of the most significant projects that
                        you were directing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>FELL: That I was directly involved in?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: Well to talk about the projects we actually managed when you were working
                    in REDSO, even when you were working a mission, sometimes you get the feeling
                    that you are one step or two steps removed from the action in the field. We have
                    contractors or technical assistants actually doing the projects themselves, and
                    we are in an office. So we are one step removed. At REDSO we were not only one
                    step removed, we were two steps removed. In fact three steps removed when you
                    are the Director or Deputy Director because it is the actual people in your
                    office that are doing the work. What we were doing was a lot of programming or
                    planning for who would be available to cover what activities. So we would help
                    the missions plan out what projects there are going to be designing? What inputs
                    the need to do those designs or implementation or evaluations? What resources
                    could we provide as a first line of resource to help or if not, get them from
                    Washington, or contract for it. So a lot of that is an administrative aspect of
                    finding people for planning or for doing certain activities. So that's a
                    planning activity. Another activity we did was sometimes we'd do functional
                    studies and we'd actually go out ourselves and do things. I'll just take an
                    example - Burundi. At one point, we were at complete odds with the government in
                    Burundi. I can't even mention on this tape how much we were at odds with that
                    government at that time. The object was to send out a mission from REDSO or
                    Washington and REDSO to go there and see if it was possible to carry on any sort
                    of program in Burundi at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was political?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>FELL: Political, yes. It was an extremely bad political situation, almost to the
                    point that they were going to break relations with the government we were so mad
                    at them over certain things they had done. This was 1985 or so. They brought two
                    people out from Washington and myself. I led this mission to go to Burundi to
                    see what is going on at least from a development standpoint. How can we continue
                    having an AID mission operating in this atmosphere? Our results were there was
                    absolutely no reason why we shouldn't continue our AID mission. Our relations
                    with Burundi on the development side were perfect. It couldn't have been better
                    in a way given the status of the country and the way they were operating and who
                    they were. Of course a lot of problems, and ethnic problems of all types. But as
                    far as a development program goes there was no reason why. The problem was
                    strictly on the State Department side, on the political level, that they were
                    having a serious problem. So we have to divide these two. We said look, if you
                    want to have a development program, there's no reason not to; they accept us; we
                    can talk to them. They are perfectly cooperative, as cooperative as any
                    government can be in the situation they are in. If you have problems on the
                    political level, that's another type of decision you have to make. The decision
                    made was to keep our AID program going because that was our thread to talk with
                    many Burundian officials at the time, whereas the State Department people were
                    absolutely behind their desks not talking to anybody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You kept the door open.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: We kept the door open, absolutely. I think that is an example of what we
                    talk about when we refer to development diplomats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there was pressure to terminate the program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: Yes, heavy pressure to terminate the program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: From Washington, from the State Department side. They wanted to close up
                    the whole thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a show of displeasure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: Serious displeasure. I think there were legitimate reasons for displeasure,
                    but we don't want to talk about them.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were able to turn that around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: I think we were able to turn it around. I think this was the most
                    development diplomacy as far as the development side goes, the Burundians had no
                    quarrel with us whatsoever. They were relatively happy with the program and the
                    way it was going. They were happy to see us in there and were delighted the AID
                    mission was cooperating with them.</p>
                <p>We had another example of a different type. We were on the verge of pulling out
                    of Tanzania in 1985 at the end of the Nyerere years. The economic situation in
                    Tanzania became very bad. We'd almost come to the point where we were going to
                    wind up the mission in Tanzania.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was on development grounds.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: Strictly on development grounds. We can't go any further; this had gone to
                    the end of the wire. When you think this is one of the grand imperial missions
                    we had in Africa with one of the emphasis countries, and we had done lot of
                    projects there. So our assignment in REDSO/Nairobi was to wind up everything and
                    to take possession of all the properties USAID was responsible for in Tanzania
                    and wind everything up. We were taking steps to do that.</p>
                <p>I remember going to Arusha. Those were the days when we had outlying offices, one
                    of three places in Africa where I worked that had outlying offices out of the
                    capital cities. One of them was in Cameroon; we had an outlying office in Buea.
                    In fact Sheldon Cole who was later an aide to Samuel Adams worked in that
                    office. We had our main office in Dar es Salaam and our outlying office in
                    Arusha. We actually owned real estate in Arusha. We had two nice pieces of
                    property in Arusha owned by USAID, the US Government. And in Sudan we had in
                    Juba an outlying office out of Khartoum. I can't think of other examples of this
                    where we had actual mini AID offices outside of the capital cities. It was
                    interesting to go to Arusha where you find sort of a miniature USAID office that
                    was still ostensibly operating 20 years after it had been ostensibly shut down
                    practically. Still with all the old forms from the old mission and people. There
                    was one local hire who was keeping everything going, maintaining in Arusha we
                    called the guest house in those days. It had been headquarters for AID
                    operations in northern Tanzania. I remember looking at our properties and
                    determining what they might be worth and if we want to sell them and making
                    recommendations and things like that. At the last minute, a new election was
                    held and President Muyini was elected in Tanzania. New hope came on the horizon
                    and USAID in its wisdom decided not to wind up the AID office. I think Fritz
                    Gilbert went down there and became the director and we continued operations down
                    there.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>Many years ago in 1969, a project in Madagascar had gotten me into Africa to
                    begin. In the 1980s, we began to warm up to Madagascar after many years of being
                    on the outs. We'd pulled completely out of Madagascar in 1972-73 with the
                    Ratsiraka government (who had just been re-elected incidentally), a very
                    socialist government which took an anti-American approach to things. We just
                    closed down completely and didn't do any more cooperating with Madagascar
                    starting in 1973 or 1974. I think they PNGed our ambassador Marshall out of
                    Madagascar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to that livestock project you were on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FELL: The project never came to fruition because our bad relations with
                    Madagascar shut it down. We went back in to Madagascar with a PL 480 Title I
                    program in about 1982-3. It was a rice project program that was using PL 480
                    Title I. We sold the rice and generated counterpart funds and started
                    programming the counterpart funds with the Madagascar government and actually
                    found they were quite happy to work with us and were inviting us to come back
                    and wanted us to come back. Then we developed a kind of a hybrid agricultural
                    import-technical assistance project for Madagascar. Madagascar agricultural
                    research I think it was called, a MARS project. I think it was developed by Jim
                    Graham who was one of our project officers in REDSO/ Nairobi. I worked with Jim
                    on that and went to Madagascar several times and developed that project, also
                    with Bob Kidd who was our PL 480 officer there. We re-instituted the program
                    there in Madagascar and ultimately assigned, Sam Ray to become our Mission
                    Director there. We set up an office there starting in '85 or '86. That was one
                    of the things I worked on.</p>
                <p>I remember going to Mauritius on our little program in Mauritius. It was an
                    interesting program. Mauritius is one of the countries we point to as a success
                    program, a success story in Africa. Maybe, as we say, there are no typical
                    missions, no typical countries. It is atypical because there are many Asians. It
                    has a different ethnic mix than any of the other counties, because they have
                    Indians. It is also both Francophone and Anglophone. The Seychelles, too. I was
                    involved in both of those programs. In Mauritius we helped work on the export
                    zones. They had export processing zones which was a concept set up in Mauritius
                    whereby they could import raw materials, process them and sell them. They
                    actually got quite an export market going.</p>
                <p>Observations on the REDSO role and promotion to Director of the REDSO/East
                    Africa</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>FELL: The point I'd like to make in programming, we were operating the REDSO
                    office. We basically had three roles I would say. The first of the roles was as
                    a service organization to provide service to the missions. We were spending a
                    lot of out time programming out people, the experts we had on the staff, the
                    engineers, the lawyers, the economists, the project officers, the social
                    analysis officers, the various disciplines we had represented. We had
                    approximately 30 direct hire people on the staff of the REDSO. We were servicing
                    all the countries in East Africa. That was our first role, the main role for
                    which the REDSO was set up. The second role was to provide programming and
                    oversight in those countries that didn't have an AID presence or where the AID
                    presence had to be pulled out for reasons of security or one reason or another
                    there wasn't any AID presence. That happened a couple of times in Uganda. There
                    were some posts that were very small like Djibouti. There was only one person
                    there, our friend John Lundgren. At various times I went up there to help out.
                    At one time working with the EGADD the regional organization for the horn of
                    Africa that was based in East Africa for the horn of Africa bringing together
                    Ethiopia, Djibouti, Sudan, Somalia, and Uganda, and Kenya I believe. These
                    countries tried to do something similar to what was done in the CILSS, the
                    interstate committee to fight drought in the Sahel zone, but of course had much
                    more difficult political problems overcoming their differences to set up a
                    viable organization. Anyway, REDSO provided services of various types.</p>
                <p>The second role was operating programs in countries where there was no presence.
                    At one point there were the Indian Ocean countries: Madagascar, Comoros,
                    Mauritius, and Seychelles. We had to manage all the programs in those countries
                    until we did set up an office in Madagascar, and then we took care of the other
                    three countries. We provided a great deal of support for Madagascar in the early
                    periods. Setting up a program in Mozambique at that time 1984-1985, was a major
                    thrust. There was very little representation in Mozambique at that time, maybe
                    one person if at all in the beginning and then someone was assigned. So REDSO
                    had a very big role in designing the early projects there. Of course this means
                    discussing strategy and trying to stake out what AID would do in a country where
                    we hadn't been present before.</p>
                <p>The third was regional projects. There were a number of regional projects still
                    floating around. Regional projects with regional organizations, pest control
                    projects, working with the lake, with the countries around the great lakes.
                    There was an economic organization that had been part of the East Africa
                    development group of countries, formerly based in Arusha which still existed. So
                    we had several of these regional type projects, and we supported those and in
                    many cases, managed them.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>When John Koehring left REDSO to become director in Khartoum in Sudan, a major
                    mission that we provided a great deal of assistance to particularly emergency
                    assistance, I became Director of REDSO/Nairobi. I would say that my main thrust
                    was to keep things going. I think we had an excellent office. John Koehring was
                    a first rate project officer, a very far sighted program person, and REDSO had
                    an excellent staff. I think that was one of our big jobs, trying to get a good
                    staff because this is a staff that is helping and doing jobs, for other staffs,
                    and in some cases doing things that the staffs in the missions themselves either
                    didn't have the technical expertise to do or the time to do. So we devoted a
                    great deal of time to selecting staff going through the USAID grapevine to see
                    who was competent and good and trustworthy, and who could operate with a good
                    deal of independence and flexibility in the field. REDSO people would fly in and
                    do their work in two, three, four weeks, whatever it took to design a project,
                    or help implement a project. They had to know quite a bit themselves to really
                    do their jobs. So we wanted to get good people. We were successful and had an
                    excellent office.</p>
                <p>Move to the Director, REDSO/West Africa - 1987</p>
                <p>I was asked by AID Washington if I was interested in moving and becoming Director
                    of the REDSO office in Ivory Coast because I spoke French and had worked in West
                    Africa quite a bit. I actually expressed an interest in doing that. Ray Love
                    called me up and said would you be interested? Just as that happened, the
                    Director was leaving. So he left and I moved there in 1987. I went to Abidjan
                    just before and interviewed with the Ambassador there, Ambassador Dennis Kux,
                    and he approved my nomination there. That was a bigger office than the REDSO
                    mission in Nairobi. We serviced all the missions and AID representatives in West
                    Africa out of that office. We had a comptrollers office that did a good deal of
                    the comptrolling or handling of financial accounts for missions and offices in
                    West Africa. I think we had a direct hire staff of 42 Americans and
                    approximately 120 local hires working both in the comptrollers office and as
                    professionals in REDSO. We also had support staff: drivers and typists and
                    secretaries and assistants. We had a hard working office there too. We had two
                    types of missions in Africa. They were divided A and B missions. The A missions
                    were able to do everything on their own and really called on REDSO sparingly.
                    The other missions which were small missions of one to five AID staff to which
                    we provided more services.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>The REDSO office in Abidjan was also doing the three things I mentioned before:
                    Doing service, managing projects where there was no AID office and also a number
                    of regional projects. For example we had regional projects in West Africa, the
                    ECOWAS, the Economic Community of West Africa, the common market of West Africa,
                    if you will, based in Lagos. We had grants to that organization, grants to
                    various regional organizations in West Africa, to the African Development Bank
                    which was based in Abidjan. So my career really came full circle. A friend of
                    mine who had been a project officer when I was with the Bank had worked his way
                    up to become the President of the bank Babakar N'Diaye. So we managed a grant,
                    we still had a grant to the African Development Bank which had moved through
                    many phases since the time I had been there in earlier times. Some 15-20 years
                    later I came back, the grant was now being used to provide many technical
                    assistance maybe eight or nine technical assistance full time in the bank; not
                    AID people now but technical assistants to help them in their computer
                    operations in studies, and in economic studies of one sort or another that the
                    bank had chosen to get involved in. The grant had grown quite a bit. I think it
                    was up to $15,000,000. I think over the years we had provided $25-30,000,000
                    range of assistance to the bank for that type of cooperation since those
                    earliest says. I should refer back to that; it started with about a $300,000
                    grant, so things had taken on quite more importance from the time when I myself
                    was a technical cooperation assistant at the bank.</p>
                <p>Then we also had the job of managing AID programs in REDSO in countries where
                    there weren't any AID offices. We did have at that time Sao Tome, a little
                    country off the coast of Gabon that we managed by remote control. Finally we
                    negotiated an agreement with the Portuguese Government in Lisbon with one of our
                    lawyers. We worked this agreement up where they would manage the project more or
                    less. We would help them pay for it and evaluate it and support it but without
                    people on the ground because we didn't have the people to put in to Sao Tome, a
                    little island country 60,000 population off the coast of Gabon as I said. I
                    eventually went to Sao Tome. It was a cocoa production project, a training
                    project, agricultural training in the cocoa plantations which was the main
                    activity in Sao Tome, a former Portuguese colony.</p>

                <p>The other country we managed was the Ivory Coast itself. Quite a large country,
                    and we had many projects in for many years. It had never been a concentration
                    country because it had been a successful country that we felt was receiving
                    sufficient aid from other donors, particularly the French. Now strangely enough,
                    and I had forgotten to mention this, one of the first projects I worked on when
                    I first came to AID as a lawyer, was for a housing project, one of the first
                    housing projects in the Ivory Coast called the Fairnmont housing project built
                    in the late 60's. I did the closing as the lawyer for that project in 1969. Lo
                    and behold, I came back to the Ivory Coast and one of the major projects we had
                    in the Ivory Coast was around the housing project. Now housing was a program
                    that had very little grant money to it; it was basically loan money of regular
                    commercial term loan money. It wasn't really aid or what we call official
                    development assistance. We eventually did negotiate some small projects with the
                    Ivory Coats. One Title I project for the import of rice which I worked on with
                    our PL 480 food aid expert Bob Kidd. That was eventually successfully
                    negotiated. I think it was considerable aid in the area of $ 20,000,000 with the
                    Ivory Coast in the earliest tranches. Eventually we increased our program in the
                    Ivory Coast into other areas after I left. I retired in 1990.</p>

                <p>I'd like to come to some of the key questions. Then after I'd left USAID, I was
                    hired by the OECD to work on aid reviews in the development cooperation
                    directorate of the OECD, which is a part of the secretariat of the OECD that
                    backstops the Development Assistance Committee, the DAC which had always been
                    chaired by an American up until now. The DAC was chaired by Mr. Maurice Williams
                    at one time we mentioned earlier, by Mr. Rutherford Poats by Mr. John Lewis,
                    former professor of economics at Princeton and AID director in India, and Joe
                    Wheeler who was Deputy Assistant Administrator of USAID. Then Ray Love replaced
                    Joe Wheeler. Now the present chairman of the DAC is Mr. James Michael who was
                    formerly deputy Assistant Administrator of AID and at one time headed up the
                    Latin America Bureau and had been an ambassador in a Central American country.
                    In the aid review division where I was hired, our job is one of the key
                    activities of the DAC: to carry on the peer group reviews of the DAC. Clearly it
                    is one of the basic core activities of the DAC and it is an operation that has
                    been going on since the earliest years of the DAC which was set up in 1961. The
                    United States was very influential in negotiating the creation of the DAC. The
                    OECD is actually the successor to the Marshall Plan organization set up to
                    provide the framework under which the Marshall Plan was provided with the
                    Organization for European Economic Cooperation, OEEC which became the OECD and
                    the United States joined the organization itself, which it had been assisting.
                    Then all the Western donors and Western countries have joined. The United States
                    wished the DAC to concentrate at that time on more burden sharing, getting other
                    donors to pick up the slack so the United States wouldn't have to be the only
                    donor which it practically was. Not really, as 60% of the aid was provided by
                    the United States. The purpose in setting it up the DAC was to encourage
                    improved efficiency and effectiveness of aid and also more volume. Well the DAC
                    has been wildly successful in this to the point where the United States is the
                    lowest ranking donor in the DAC the real comparative basis being GNP to ODA
                    (official development assistance). The DAC also define what assistance would be.
                    They called it official development assistance which would have a certain amount
                    of conditionality to it. It would be given for economic and social development
                    purposes. There are many financial guidelines as to what qualifies for ODA,
                    official development assistance and what doesn't. Military aid is completely
                    excluded. The aid which is not aimed at those purposes, if it is commercially
                    oriented is not ODA. If the main purpose is commercial, it doesn't qualify as
                    ODA. And now other donors are very active and provide a much higher percentage
                    of their GNP for this purpose than we do. Ours is below .15%, while some provide
                    1% of their GNP, mostly the Nordic countries, to this purpose. And to the DAC,
                    The Development Assistance Committee, the peer group review is one of the main
                    things this group does. I'd say the three main core activities are collecting
                    statistics, organizing high level meetings of the ministers of cooperation to
                    discuss policy and strategies and approaches and compare notes and conducting
                    peer group aid reviews. The collection of statistics on how much aid was
                    provided to what countries in what manner and all that. The third main core
                    activity is the peer group reviews themselves where the committee itself looks
                    at each one of its members, sort of, if you will, puts them on the grill, does
                    studies about them, tries to understand how they are administered, how they are
                    organized, where the aid goes, what the policies are, what the purpose is, how
                    the aid is evaluated to determine if they are trying to improve the efficiency
                    and quality , staffing and delivery of their aid that is being provided. The
                    peer group review operates in a way where the Secretariat does some basic
                    studies, the country itself submits a memorandum. Two of the committee members
                    are each time assigned as examiners who help the secretariat and work alongside
                    the secretariat, or the secretariat works alongside the examiners to sort of
                    prosecute if you will the peer group review. They bring out as much information
                    as they can about it by visiting capitals, visiting the capital of the country
                    that is being examined and also developing countries where aid is being provided
                    to the extent that time is available to do it, and collecting information about
                    it and writing a report which describes in fairly complete detail, we hope, as
                    many of the salient aspects about the program to make it understandable to the
                    other members. Then these are critiqued, discussed, and ideas are exchanged both
                    favorable and unfavorable. Many good ideas come out of these aid reviews. In
                    fact we try to put the emphasis on the favorable and the good ideas. I have
                    conducted between 18 and 20 aid reviews from the time I began there in 1990 when
                    I retired from USAID. I've conducted three aid reviews of the United States
                    itself, three on Japan, I've worked on the European Commission, the United
                    Kingdom, Finland a couple of times, Sweden, Switzerland, Canada, and did I say
                    the European commission? I've done other things in the Secretariat. Followed up
                    on the aid coordination, which is another aspect of the DAC. Many years ago the
                    DAC suggested the World Bank do more in aid coordination. They started the
                    consultative groups which are normally held in Paris. The consultative groups
                    train on a certain number of countries developing countries and the World Bank
                    holds annual meetings in Paris. The DAC has a monitoring role since it was a key
                    organization in trying to see how aid coordination takes place, both on the
                    upper levels and on the field itself. We backstop the UNDP round tables, which
                    handle many of the lesser developed countries. Strangely enough in earlier times
                    I conducted the US delegation to consultative groups like for Madagascar when we
                    were representing Madagascar in earlier years in the 1980's. So there I was on
                    the other side of the table sort of monitoring these consultative group
                    mechanisms and writing reports on them. So this is feedback on aid coordination
                    mechanism.</p>

                <p>Views on USAID as a development organization</p>
                <p>I'm going to append to this report a short history of USAID that I wrote for the
                    last aid review and may be of interest to those who are sort of looking at the
                    history of AID, because I was asked to capsulize it in a very short report of
                    two or three pages, so I think this might be of interest. In this report I've
                    tried to describe my career. I've spent all of it working in Africa.</p>
                <p>The major changes were cycles in how the program was managed in Africa. First of
                    all we had many bilateral missions, and AID offices everywhere. Then, we went to
                    emphasis countries that were major missions like Ghana, Liberia, Tanzania. I
                    remember when I first came into the Africa Bureau, North Africa was still in the
                    Africa Bureau which included Morocco and Tunisia. Then they were moved off the
                    Near East Bureau. Tanzania and Kenya were emphasis countries. The rest (not
                    “emphasis countries) were in a regional framework. At least in West Africa, we
                    had regional development offices. I mentioned that I was assigned to the
                    regional office in Yaounde and then in Dakar. As years went by we became more
                    bilateral and were able to set up AID missions in almost all African countries.
                    I mean in almost all the countries, some 40 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, we
                    were able to have either AID missions or AID offices. Now as I look at Africa in
                    1996, we are closing down many AID offices and missions. I suspect we will be
                    going back to managing many programs in a regional way or not having programs at
                    all in certain countries, somewhat as it was 25 years earlier in the late 60's
                    early 70's. So we see these things as cycles.</p>
                <p>I also saw cycles as to whether we managed things on a geographical basis or on a
                    sectoral basis. There were various offices set up at different times jockeying.
                    Some had a sectoral focus, others had a geographic focus. Of course in the very
                    earliest days we had loans going to Africa managed in the very strong capital
                    Development and Finance office, extremely well organized, with well prepared
                    projects, infrastructure project mostly. That completely disappeared and that
                    capability disappeared from the AID staffing. What I would like to say about
                    staffing and personnel is that I always had the impression that AID offices in
                    the field spent too much time catering to the needs of AID/ Washington answering
                    questions which undoubtedly seemed important coming from Congressional sources
                    or other constituents in the states, but did permit us in the field to spend
                    sufficient time learning about the country itself, dialoguing with the local
                    government, and really understanding the local scene better.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>On a long term basis, we should be talking to the target people who would be
                    involved in projects. I think we satisfied ourselves by talking to more educated
                    elite type people who were one or two steps removed from the target group we
                    were working with. We rarely had the time to do as a colleague if mine did one
                    time in Cameroon. He was with the UNDP. Actually it wasn't the UNDP it was a UN
                    office called MULPAC. All I can do is tell you the acronym. There were several
                    of these MULPAC offices setup by the UN in the 1970's and they disappeared. He
                    was assigned to one of those offices, and instead of doing the kind of regional
                    planning that was envisioned, he was a type of a person who believed more in
                    participatory development. He spent many weeks going out talking, or rather
                    listening, to target groups. He would actually sit around the fire, go into the
                    homes and meetings and villages and spent hours and hours trying to understand
                    the development situation of people in a given area in Cameroon. Now, very few
                    USAID officers ever did anything remotely like that. This man's name was Andr�
                    Lefever. I'm still in contact with him. He's retired and lives in France. But he
                    was one of the few people I ever knew who actually went and listened to people
                    in villages. One of the things I remember him telling me was that one of the
                    major problems that people had in villages was roaming animals. I had never
                    heard of this problem but when that I met him and he told me about it, I, too,
                    became sensitive to it. In certain villages particularly in the rain forest area
                    there was no way of controlling roaming animals. We always encourage people to
                    improve their nutrition by setting up gardens and school gardens and whatnot,
                    but these needed to be protected because there was nothing to prevent chickens
                    and goats and animals of one sort or another from just roaming around and
                    rummaging around and destroying whatever gardens were being tended to by people
                    in villages. He probed the difficulties of making village woodlots on a communal
                    basis work, questions of land tenure, and local questions.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>It is very hard to find out things like that from elite people who distance
                    themselves from village life. They understand it little better than we do
                    ourselves as outsiders unless they go down and spend a lot of time talking to
                    villagers who will actually be involved in projects. Now this is the different
                    type of project I'm talking about; I'm not talking about policy projects but
                    projects that are going to be aimed at people's lives. But some of the projects
                    we were doing in health and in agriculture were related to these things. I think
                    we didn't have the time, the leisure, the ability, and the personnel on the
                    staff to really take the time to understand the societies we were working in as
                    well as we should. I was asked what projects that I worked on that might have
                    succeeded. I remember one project I worked on in Cameroon. It was a Swiss
                    project on the training of farmers. They would take young farmers, from the
                    villages and they would spend one year on a model farm station, but it wasn't
                    model in the sense that it was modern. It was model in the sense that it was
                    using local material, local resources to teach youngsters, young farmers how to
                    do better with what they have. To plow better, to use inputs better, husbandry,
                    also how to simply improve their own skills at making their own tools, and
                    understanding markets better, and just getting an education for being better
                    farmers. This was a project that we started in 1975. I heard 20 years later that
                    it still was operating as a flagship project for the Cameroon AID mission. It
                    had been successful I understand. At least it was pointed out as a successful
                    project which is one of the things we never know sometimes and don't hear which
                    projects have turned out successfully over many years because we are either at
                    the beginning or the middle or the end.</p>
                <p>We rarely see the whole cycle of projects. For instance, take the African
                    Development Bank. Some projects were so big, so massive that it is difficult to
                    encompass them as projects themselves because they have such an enormous impact.
                    I worked on the African Development Bank as an institution which has been
                    variously criticized and yet it's a thoroughly African institution in many ways
                    with all the foibles and problems that any African institution will have in a
                    national setting and trying to avoid corruption. Corruption creeps in, poor
                    quality overcomes better quality, with political pressures. I mentioned how a
                    President of a country wrote a letter to the president of the bank on one
                    project. That it might be a pet project, and that is how projects get deviated.
                    Well these things are part of political process in any country. They take place
                    in our country, too, in a different way, but they are almost unavoidable. What
                    we've attempted to do in many of our programs and projects is to create the
                    processes whereby these things don't take over and become the main thrust of
                    activities. Enough rules, regulations, processes, trained people are there to
                    keep things on track.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>A point on how USAID operates I want to make. I've always felt that USAID
                    missions were too muscle-bound, that there were too many people in our AID
                    missions for their own good. This may be somewhat in contradiction to what I
                    said earlier that we didn't have time to really learn about the local situation
                    or get into it enough. I think the solution has to be to somehow lighten the
                    burden of requests for information from Washington. If we had better information
                    systems that were linked together, whereby we had contracting information,
                    design information, and accounting information, more homogeneously contained, it
                    would improve things. I understand that systems like this are being put in, so
                    many of the statistical questions could be answered more easily. I think if we
                    had clearer objectives, which I understand that AID is adopting now, called
                    strategic objectives, we might be able to spend more time in the field. I think
                    my experience was that by having so many people in the missions we spent so much
                    time managing ourselves that we didn't actually have time to manage projects,
                    the programs the programs and projects in the country. That is somewhat of an
                    exaggeration, but I think there is a lot of truth to it. I spent much more time
                    managing and worrying about the 40-some direct hire in REDSO Abidjan which was
                    the largest mission in sub-Saharan Africa than we did worrying about the 120 or
                    so local hires, the Ivorians and other nationalities, we hired in our REDSO
                    office. I think the most effective little office I was in, was in Cameroon where
                    we only had four direct hires for the program and had a regional responsibility
                    in addition to that. I think we all substituted for one another and were all on
                    top of the program. I remember later when I was working on an OECD review, I was
                    doing an aid review of Japan and I went to Indonesia. In fact I've been to many
                    countries in Asia and looked at aid programs there since then and found out that
                    although one could have an inferiority complex in Africa about some things, I've
                    come to the conclusion that the programs weren't any worse in Africa, and I
                    could say the same for Central America where I've also been on missions since
                    then. But to return to going to Indonesia working on the Japanese aid
                    program.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>I went to the OECF office which is the Organization for Economic Cooperation Fund
                    of Japan, their loan arm. I went to their office, this was in 1992, they had one
                    billion dollars a year going to Indonesia, the largest aid program perhaps in
                    the world. I went into the OECF office and they had clean desks all over and
                    five Japanese staff, their entire staff, and maybe one or two secretaries. They
                    had 150 active infrastructure projects. Maybe 10-15% of all the roads, ports and
                    electric projects in Indonesia. A huge program. They answered my questions very
                    calmly with no seeming problems, and they had lists, and reports and we learned
                    about their program. I went to the USAID office and they had something like 40
                    direct-hire people at the time. There was sheer pandemonium in the USAID office.
                    People I had known from other parts of AID running up and down the hall, saying,
                    “Hello, Art, talk to you later” and running down the hall with papers strewn out
                    behind them and cradling phones in their offices at the same time talking. I
                    went to the program officer who was running out of his mind cradling the phone
                    and trying to talk to us and giving us a piece of paper that would be our
                    briefing. I said what's the program here? He said oh we got $30,000,000 a year.
                    I thought: There has got to be something wrong here. How could we be doing
                    $30,000,000 a year with 40 direct hires and something like 150 local hires,
                    about 180 people and the Japanese have five hires and are doing a billion dollar
                    program. Maybe there's something wrong here.</p>
                <p>I think one of the problems with USAID missions in the field and with USAID in
                    Washington is “frenetic.” The frenetic atmosphere one finds in USAID missions
                    and in Washington. We just don't seem to be able to do things calmly, take
                    decisions based on more field experience, on what is going on. I think we have
                    an enormous amount of commitment in people in the agency that I have met and
                    known, a great deal of expertise about how to do economic development and how to
                    carry on dialogue, and how to manage and implement projects. But a system that
                    pushes all of this into a frenetic activity that was often not trained at the
                    objective of helping developing countries develop, but was trained at meeting
                    certain self imposed deadlines within the agency that created a certain frenetic
                    aspect to the way we worked. I think this prevented us from understanding many
                    things in the field that would have improved the quality of our aid.</p>
                <p>Another example of this, I think there was a major shift from doing
                    infrastructure which Africa needed badly in many respects and a failure to
                    recognize that one can do an enormous amount of training, of transfer of
                    technology, and actually do something physical on the ground that needed to be
                    done and otherwise wouldn't be done in Africa through infrastructure projects
                    and the belittling of that type of project in comparison to the softer type of
                    projects, There are social type projects, the technical assistance projects, the
                    training projects, and I don't belittle them. I think they are very important in
                    their own right. I think an approach marrying up these two doing something
                    useful - doing and learning at the same time, would be good.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>During one of my training seminars, I took the development studies program when I
                    was in AID which was a two month training seminar in development studies. We
                    went to Tuskegee Institute. I remember the Institute had been built by the
                    students themselves. The students had been trained, this was back in the 19th
                    century, George Washington Carver was behind the Tallahassee University, I think
                    in Alabama. You could see the school was built and how the bricks had been laid
                    by the students, and they were teaching the students carpentry and masonry and
                    how to build while the Institute was being built. I think a lot of this should
                    be done in Africa. I think there is much useful infrastructure that could be
                    built, and the training could have been done at the same time. I think that AID
                    at the same time gave undue emphasis to written policies which would never be
                    carried out and couldn't be carried out by governments instead of working on the
                    conditions under which the policies could be carried out.</p>
                <p>I think that is one area where the Club du Sahel made a real contribution, to try
                    and talk and understand, to try to create the conditions under which things
                    could be done. The countries themselves will find their policies when the
                    training atmosphere is improved, but imposing these from the outside in
                    conditionality is not very permanent or durable or sustainable. In this respect
                    I think I learned a great deal from the Swiss Program in Benin and doing the
                    Swiss aid review, which I just did last year in 1996, that allowing local
                    countries to do more themselves, not depending so much on outsiders such as
                    USAID, universities and large technical assistance teams, which I think create
                    the wrong type of atmosphere and get things kind of turned around. It gets us
                    thinking things are better than they are because they are being artificially
                    held up and being artificially carried out by people we are paying. They are
                    from the outside and are not really reaching the people themselves. It means
                    taking a much longer view of things, of being willing to take a slower pace of
                    development and being willing to see mistakes made. But they would be mistakes
                    made by the countries themselves, not our mistakes and living with that. I think
                    that is the kind of development which is more sustainable and is internalized
                    better by the countries themselves. I think some of the most satisfying
                    projects, at least that I worked on, tended to be the projects that combined
                    both training and actual physical infrastructure of one sort or another.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>I felt one of the prime examples was the Trans-Cameroon railroad where hundreds
                    of carpenters and welders and heavy equipment operators, stock room people and
                    accountants were trained and the trans Cameroon railroad was built itself, and
                    engineers were trained. We did this with road building projects in various
                    places. We did it in a small way. I can think of other small projects we did
                    this with such as the Bakel livestock project (in Senegal) where there was some
                    very small construction done and training done and at the same time a couple of
                    things were done that we thought would improve livestock practices. Also, in the
                    irrigation perimeters in the Bakel region. We had a regional project in Nairobi
                    when I was there. It was the remote sensing project where many Africans were
                    brought in with European assistance to try to learn to use this technology and
                    we provided equipment and training together with technical assistance. I think
                    when things are put in to the context of a project, aimed at a product that is
                    something of its own, and not just training in an abstract sense, it might tend
                    to be more sustainable and have more effect. I think that many of our efforts in
                    regional development were overly optimistic and didn't take into consideration
                    the level of commitment the countries would make to those regional programs,
                    which they would make by paying their dues and supporting a regional approach.
                    Here I think we simply misread the tea leaves or thought that by leading and
                    providing assistance, by cajoling, begging, pushing, we would get some results.
                    The net result after 20-30 years of working with regional organizations
                    particularly in Africa was that if the countries aren't ready to do it, it is
                    very unlikely that anything will come out of it.</p>
                <p>So it is not the push that is going to do it, it is the countries themselves and
                    we can maybe help on the sidelines, but I'm really doubtful whether the donors
                    can do much in regional cooperation until the countries themselves are ready to
                    put a commitment behind it. In this respect I think that the Club du Sahel
                    process was quite illuminating. It never attempted do be a regional organization
                    in the sense of a common market or anything like that. It was more of a regional
                    network in the sense of building up dialogue and discussion between the
                    countries themselves with respect to common problems. Then from there it would
                    be a slow process over a number of years better chances for regional integration
                    could come about.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>I know other parts of Africa where other attempts like the Sadec part of Southern
                    Africa, different approaches have been used and that's another lesson learned.
                    All the lessons learned are local lessons learned basically. I think Tip O'Neill
                    said it. All politics are local politics. It seems to me that there are some
                    general ideas and theories and approaches one can extract from USAID and other
                    donor practices. The DAC has done so and has published a book called Effective
                    Principles of Development Cooperation. To most USAID officers this would be like
                    reading Mary had a Little Lamb because they are quite basic. If you are going to
                    do a project you ought to study the project beforehand and you need to watch out
                    for the implementation of the project, you ought to evaluate it at some point.
                    They were all pretty basic things, but it was amazing to me how many donors
                    actually didn't take some of these things very seriously. Strangely enough, even
                    AID at various times did not take some of these basic principles as seriously as
                    it might have because of lack of time. And that we would do the formalistic
                    steps of having project papers and covering all the bases with elaborate project
                    analysis and study, but those that were close up and inside the process knew
                    that many things were being left aside because of this and I go back to it, this
                    frenetic, this activist approach and not allowing sufficient time to carry
                    things out.</p>
                <p>I think in that respect there might have been a fault in the entire USAID system
                    of not allowing sufficient resources for what they use in the United Kingdom
                    parlance, process projects or rolling process projects. At one time we did have
                    that kind of a project in the US that was called a rolling project but we didn't
                    really believe in it and our system didn't allow it to operate with the kind of
                    flexibility that it should have. But permitting missions to do studies over time
                    that would be between a study and a project, learning while you are designing
                    the project and taking the time to provide resources that would develop the idea
                    over time and work with the host government and the local people in a slower
                    process and reaching eventually a project. I think we had an article in the
                    Foreign Assistance Act (611) which required adequate feasibility studies and so
                    on before a project could be undertaken. I really don't think that kind of a
                    legal requirement poses an insurmountable impediment to looking at projects.
                    Particularly projects involving people in a process oriented way.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>Now I'm asked here what was my favorite overseas post. Far and away my favorite
                    overseas post was my first posting to Abidjan, Ivory Coast in 1971 working in
                    the African Development Bank with many different nationalities, We had an
                    Egyptian who wrote my efficiency report. I worked side by side with a Moroccan.
                    I had a Senegalese gentleman who was sort of my immediate boss. I worked side by
                    side with many nationalities, French, Yugoslav, you name it. Ivory Coast in
                    those days was very safe and very lovely. We had glowing memories from that
                    period. I think that anyone who listens to USAID people who have worked
                    overseas, we all got sick at one time or another. I enjoyed working in Cameroon
                    because of the major project we had, the trans Cameroon railroad. We had a small
                    mission there that was very active. We worked up in Chad which was interesting,
                    but I got sick down there so that sort of put the kibosh on my memory of
                    Cameroon. I got amoebas I guess or some sort of a parasite, stomach problems.
                    That carried on somewhat while I was in Dakar. I found that a rather nice
                    posting in Senegal but not as nice as the Ivory Coast. Then being posted at the
                    Club du Sahel in Paris actually turned out to be interesting and rather pleasant
                    but a lot of travel. I spent nearly half my time in Africa.</p>
                <p>I forgot to mention one of the most memorable people I met I suppose was the
                    President of the United States' mother, Lillian Carter. When I was at the Club
                    du Sahel, I was the officer in charge of taking her to the Sahel on her visit
                    when she went there. She was working with a fellow named Hardin who was out of
                    the White House. We took her to the Sahel. I remember we went with her to
                    Ouagadougou in Upper Volta, to Mali and Timbuktu, also to Gambia. I had to make
                    all this trip twice. We went first to check everything out; then I had to go
                    back a second time when we actually made the trip with her. She was a very
                    interesting lady. At one time she looked at me and said you don't seem to talk
                    very much. And it was true, I was more of a listener than a talker. She said,
                    “I'd like to know more of what you're thinking.” So I told her things somewhat
                    similar to what has been on this tape. At that time we were trying to “sell” the
                    Sahel program and to encourage the administration to do as much as we could for
                    those countries and to keep the network we were trying to build going. We were
                    always afraid that the United States would just lose heart and pull out. That
                    was all started in 1973-74-75 and the actual Club du Sahel process was started
                    then. It is still going today in 1997. I suppose we shouldn't have been so
                    worried that things were going to collapse at any minute and they did
                    continue.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>I think the major accomplishment of USAID that I saw in the field, and this may
                    be sort of a strange response, was actually the professionalism of the
                    organization itself. I think I saw many devoted staff who worked very closely
                    with their local counterparts who really put their hearts in to what they were
                    doing. I wouldn't want to pick out an individual project or program, although I
                    have a few little pet favorites. I thought the Trans Cameroon railroad was good.
                    If I thought about it I could probably pick out a few other infrastructure
                    projects that I was involved in, even the training projects. I haven't even
                    mentioned population which was extremely important. We did some very good
                    population programs of all types in training, in private enterprise. We brought
                    population projects into Senegal, the Ivory Coast. We did population programs in
                    Kenya while I was there. I think the United States assistance program has left
                    an extremely favorable impression with many people in Africa who looked to us as
                    professionals. Who even distinguished it from diplomacy. They might have
                    disagreed with the United States at various times or our various positions on
                    different things. But I think they looked at USAID itself as really an
                    institution that was helping, that was there when things were needed, when
                    emergencies broke out knew they could count on USAID. When the government was
                    trying to do something, they consulted with the local USAID mission; they knew
                    there were people there who were experienced, that were interested, that would
                    try to provide advice, consult, and provide assistance when they could. I think
                    that was the most important thing, the presence of USAID. But I don't think
                    large USAID missions were necessary.</p>
                <p>I think smaller, harder hitting, professional, three and four and five person
                    missions would be best, perhaps backed up, or backstopped by a regional office
                    in strategic locations where more expertise in other disciplines could be
                    represented and that aren't needed on a continual basis in the country itself.
                    Lawyers, engineers, economists, maybe you don't need them on a continual basis,
                    but you need generalists that are well trained. I think that is another aspect
                    of development that we tend to underestimate. The fascination of it is that you
                    work in so many different sectors and activities. We were working on policy, we
                    were working on various sectors in economic development, economics, technical
                    aspects of various projects that you have to have more than just a smattering of
                    knowledge in order to work on them, and putting projects together, designing
                    projects, the discipline of that, with the legal backdrop we have in our whole
                    agency.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>I think that it is an activity of tremendous variety that extends over the whole
                    of human experience, if you will, of looking at things in education, health,
                    infrastructure, economics, political science, population, what have you. All
                    these different activities provide fields that are interesting in their own
                    right and taken globally provide a wide variety of interest. USAID was able to
                    bring together people that could help these developing countries, and I think
                    that was our most lasting and important contribution. I don't think that looking
                    around at other donors as I have done in the OECD and the DAC, few donors have
                    that kind of committed professionalism in their aid offices. Most other donors I
                    think, I don't say all of them, tend to take a more of an eight to five attitude
                    towards their job. They're not career development professionals often. There
                    could be advantages where they are more detached. They certainly don't have the
                    terrible frenetic aspect that our USAID missions have, but they don't have the
                    commitment the USAID officers and staff have.</p>
                <p>I think I've come to the end of this. It has been a very fascinating discussion
                    for me to look back on a career in USAID. When I left USAID, I thought that I
                    was almost like leaving my mother or an organization that had looked over me,
                    that I had felt part of, that I was very attached to. I had a great deal of
                    difficulty in leaving USAID behind. I didn't for the first few years; I kept
                    thinking about it; I kept worrying about it. In fact I still do in aid reviews
                    but in a somewhat more detached way because it has a life of its own and will
                    carry on without me. I know that. But when I left AID I thought cymbals would
                    crash and something big would happen. Nothing really big happened. It went
                    ahead; its life went on, and mine has done likewise. Just as an example, one
                    year after I left the organization, I happened to pick up an awards pamphlet and
                    I saw in there that my name was there and that I had gotten an outstanding
                    career award. I called up our AID DAC delegate who at that time was Martin
                    Dagata and said “Martin I see my name here. I haven't gotten any certificate, I
                    haven't been advised of this, I didn't know anything about it.” He said, “Gee,
                    that's interesting.” He sent a cable back to Washington. I didn't get the
                    certificate for another year after that. Which goes to show you that once you
                    are gone they don't really think about you very much because the agency doesn't
                    think. I'm sure that many individuals I've met in the agency and locals that I
                    have met do think of us, though.</p>
                <p>I should add one other thing that has been a great pleasure. I think I've tried
                    to give a helping hand to others, both locals and Americans to further their own
                    careers. I know others in AID have had a very conscious effort in trying to do
                    that, of trying to pass the baton, of trying to help others, of getting them
                    jobs. We had a program when I was in Senegal of hiring former Peace Corps
                    volunteers. Many of these people have joined the agency. Probably some of them
                    are dictating tapes like this about their careers in USAID or on the verge of it
                    having also turned in a career. I think that was something I've tried to do and
                    still try to do to give good advice to people who want to go in to international
                    development. It is a very satisfying and interesting career, varied, providing
                    the opportunity for travel. I wish I could have heard a description of it as I
                    think I've attempted to do before I started and I might have been able to get
                    even more out of it. I wish anyone who is going to do a career or is looking at
                    this subject all the best.</p>
