                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: April 9, 2003</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, today is the 9th of April, I think it's Appomattox
                        Day, 2003. This is an interview with Richard McKee. This is being done on
                        behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training, and I'm
                        Charles Stuart Kennedy. Do you go by Dick or do you...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: No, Richard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Richard. Good for you. Richard, could you tell me when and
                        where you were born and something about your past?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: I was born on the 21st of January, 1941, in a town called New Brighton,
                    Pennsylvania, which is a small industrial town, in the Ohio valley, on the
                    border with Ohio. My father was the first in his family to go to a university.
                    The family were small farmers in the hills in Pennsylvania. He went to Penn
                    State, later got a Master's degree from Duke. He started out as a schoolteacher
                    and then became a technical writer, which is what he did for most of his life,
                    and then finally he was an editor. My mother's family were from an industrial
                    town also in western Pennsylvania. Father was primarily Scots-Irish; my mother a
                    mixture of Scots and German.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was her maiden name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Her maiden name was Alma Keller. She went to the public schools in western
                    Pennsylvania and then studied for two years at normal school, as it was then
                    called, and taught for a long time. She finally got her bachelor's degree, and
                    then a master's degree, I think two master's degrees. I lived in western
                    Pennsylvania as a kid. My father worked, after he left school teaching, for
                    Johns and Laughlin Steel. After the Second World War we moved up to Niagara
                    Falls, New York, where I went to the public schools. I graduated from a suburban
                    high school, actually a central school, in Lewiston. In 1959 I got a scholarship
                    from the Gannett people for delivering newspapers. It was enough along with the
                    State scholarships from the New York Regents Board for me to afford four years
                    at Cornell University.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay I want to go back here, in your family, was your
                        mother teaching too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: My mother was also still teaching, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did, brothers, sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: I have an older sister, now retired, who went to Cornell two years ahead
                    of me, got a law degree by correspondence some years later from the University
                    of London and retired from the Justice Department after a long and very
                    illustrious career as a general counsel for the U.S. part of Interpol. My
                    younger brother is a psychologist. He teaches at the University of South
                    Carolina at the medical school and has a private practice. His specialty is
                    children who kill parents and parents who kill children, and he has frequently
                    been called upon to testify in court. He's quoted in a recent issue of U.S. News
                    World Report.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well this, this shows that, let's talk about your early
                        childhood, what sort of rule did you parents play in this? You know, were
                        they sitting around the dinner table talking about things, I mean what got
                        all of you sort of on these professional careers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: What we're talking about here really is, if I can distance myself from my
                    parents, which none of us does very easily, you know, is very much upwardly
                    mobile, striving middle class family. No question that education was seen as the
                    key to upward mobility. The emphasis was placed on education, on doing well in
                    school, not at the expense of extracurricular activities, but academics clearly
                    came first. All three of us knew this. We also knew that our parents couldn't
                    afford private universities, so we had to get some scholarships. My sister was
                    so bright that in fact she made money from scholarships in her four years in
                    Cornell, which you can't do anymore. And I certainly was helped by scholarships.
                    My interest in the Foreign Service is traceable back to when I was in junior
                    high school. I think the real root goes back to when we lived in Lewiston, New
                    York when I was growing up. There was a U.S. Consulate at Niagara Falls,
                    Ontario, just across the river. And I would see this U.S. flag flying in Canada,
                    and that sort of intrigued me, and so, from really very early on the career that
                    I wanted was the Foreign Service. And so in that sense I'm quite content. I did
                    what I wanted to do as a kid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let's go back to sort of elementary school boy, you
                        were going to school, really at that point you're up in Lewiston, was that
                        it, in New York. How was the elementary school, any teachers sort of
                        subjects sort of stick out in your mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>MCKEE: Oh yes, I did up to sixth grade at Niagara Falls, in Niagara Falls there
                    was a system called the informal group, which was kids who were selected for
                    academic achievement, high I.Q., twelve fifth-graders and twelve sixth-graders,
                    learning together. The teacher's name for those two years was Doris Warner. I
                    remember her very well. And again the whole push was that one could do well
                    academically. My mother at the same time was teacher at the other informal
                    group. There were two of them in the Niagara Falls public school system. We
                    moved to Lewiston, which is on the river, and a little bit north of Niagara
                    Falls, as I went into seventh grade. So I did seventh through twelfth grade at
                    Lewiston Porter Central School, which had recently been centralized. Large
                    campus, new buildings, what have you. But still pretty small, my graduating
                    class from high school in 1959 was a hundred people. There were some truly
                    outstanding teachers. Among the ones that stick in my mind were an English
                    teacher named Laura Thorn, a history teacher named Don Yates. It was really an
                    outstanding education. One thing that struck me was that in going to Cornell and
                    later joining the Foreign Service, I never felt that my high school education
                    was deficient. But we're talking about a central school that drew some
                    suburbanites, some small-town types, and lots of farmers. About fifty percent of
                    the kids in my graduating class went on to something that could be called
                    post-secondary education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about things like reading? In your family, was there
                        a lot of reading?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: My father was a voracious reader, my mother not so much. He was a
                    technical editor. He had wanted to get a doctorate at one point, from Duke, in
                    English Literature, but that didn't work out, before I was born. So reading was
                    a very, very important activity. Always. And discussion around the dinner
                    table.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, in discussion around the dinner table, was
                        there a political cast in your family at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Not particularly. My father then was in sort of low-level management,
                    editor of the house magazine for an abrasives company, but very much Republican.
                    We were Republicans on both sides of the family, Scots-Irish Presbyterian on my
                    father's side, out of the hills in Pennsylvania, and skilled worker AFL-CIO on
                    my mother's side. Protestants. And no one should kid himself or herself, in the
                    '30s and the '40s in this country, the Protestant cast of the Republican party
                    and the Catholic cast to the Democratic party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well one only has to think of Al Smith running.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>MCKEE: There you go. My father's mother was active in Republican politics in
                    Pennsylvania. She was a leader of the group WCTU, Christian temperance which is
                    very much a Protestant operation. So they were Republicans. As I was as a kid,
                    but then I went off to Cornell, and I was influenced by Ted Lowi. He is very
                    distinguished now, a professor of government, but then a grad student. I moved
                    over to the other side of the political spectrum where I have stayed ever since.
                    I am devoutly now a paleo-Liberal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what about reading? Thinking as a young boy, what
                        sort of books do you read?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: History, historical novels, I can't really say much non-fiction when I was
                    in high school, except for history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was also the era of great historical novels too, I mean
                        these were...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Very much so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You picked up an awful, I mean there were a lot of good
                        historical novels which were very popular.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: And my parents had a decent bookshelf in the house, and of course
                    encouraged us to all go in the public library and take out books. I think if you
                    polled FSOs, you'd find that the number that were stamp collectors is very high.
                    I really do. I was a stamp collector.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I noticed this, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: I think stamp collecting is a good indicator of future FSO tendencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now I wasn't a stamp collector but I was a map reader. And
                        remember again I'm suddenly, before 1928, I figure, if I really wanted to
                        run away from home, I wanted to go, I'd had it all figured out where I
                        wanted to go. A place called Wake Island, which had I done that at the age
                        of twelve wouldn't have been a very good place to go. But it seemed sort of
                        out there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: My parents actually papered my bedroom when I was in high school in
                    National Geographic maps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How wonderful!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>MCKEE: For one thing, the quality of the paper was very high, and second it was
                    colorful, and third I did love maps. So this was a great way to stand there and
                    think 'I wonder where Wake Island is, and who lives there, and how the people
                    get there and get off of that place.'</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about in school, what parts of it did you excel in or
                        survive in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well in high school I took the academic side, which in upstate New York
                    State meant you took all the Regents exams. I did very well in English, I did
                    very well in history and government and languages. I did poorly in math, and I
                    did poorly in science. I flunked the physics exam and had to take the Regents
                    exam again. I passed it the second time, but just barely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of like the profile of a good Foreign Service
                        Officer. Extracurricular activities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Band. I was a bassoonist, that's about it. I'm not particularly athletic.
                    In the '50s, this tends to happen whenever a society feels threatened, gender
                    roles tend to become more rigid than perhaps they usually are. So in the late
                    '50s in high school, boys took shop and girls took home economics and typing.
                    Looking back on my career, I should have taken home economics and typing and to
                    hell with shop. But you just didn't do that in the late '50s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember I took some, print shop, very handy, I learned
                        how to set type by hand.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Hey, that's a skill we all need. I still type damn fast. But it's my own
                    system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I agree with you. While you were at the high school, did,
                        either at the dinner table discussions or in school, was there, you know

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: I really don't think so. I remember those drills in school, duck and
                    cover, which we now realize would have been totally pointless in the event of a
                    nuclear attack. But unlike I guess a lot of people I never felt somehow
                    threatened by nuclear war. I just didn't think it would happen. So I don't
                    really think that the Cold War was such a feature. On the other hand, two things
                    stand out from when I was a kid. I remember when Truman fired MacArthur. And
                    upstate New York this was...</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: But I remember it distinctly. And in upstate New York, people thought that
                    Truman was a traitor. I mean it was a real fight. I don't recall the McCarthyite
                    period and the constraint on free speech. My mother told me recently that when
                    she was teaching, she wrote a letter to President Truman to protest something. I
                    can't remember what it was. She had mentioned it in passing to her principal,
                    and her principal was quite apprehensive. She thought the FBI would come and
                    investigate them and that this was a wrong thing to do.</p>

                        Well while you were going through High, did you read the paper by the

                <p>MCKEE: Well, I delivered the Niagara Falls Gazette for five years, the last two
                    years with a clear eye on this Gannett scholarship, and yes, I read that, I had
                    it read completely when I was a third of the way through the route.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Yes. You know it's curious, I found that there has been a sort of a triple
                    evolution in my reading the newspaper. When I was a kid, I read the world events
                    first, secondly national events, and third local events, and never sports or
                    business. In my professional career of course, I read about world events. I
                    found that national events took more and more of my interest. I've become, as
                    the years have gone on, more and more active politically to the extent one could
                    under the Hatch Act. Now actually I find I turn to the local events first, then
                    national. And world events yes, but it tends to be specialized, places where I
                    served.</p>

                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>MCKEE: I applied to, and was accepted in three places. Wisconsin, which I knew
                    had a crackerjack history and government department, Cornell, and Georgetown,
                    for the Foreign Service. I knocked out Wisconsin because it was too far away,
                    and Georgetown because in those days the good fathers tucked you into bed at
                    eleven-thirty at night. I'd had enough of that by the time I was eighteen years
                    old and full of myself. I got these two scholarships from the Regents Board
                    which were applicable only at a university in New York State. Curiously, my
                    sister was then two years ahead of me at Cornell, as I mentioned, but we
                    actually saw each other very little during the two years that we were both on
                    campus.</p>

                <p>MCKEE: Well, as everyone knows, it's one of the most beautiful campuses in the
                    country, despite some really awful architecture that's come up lately. It struck
                    me as large, competitive, but I made dean's list my first term, so I felt I
                    could hold my own with anybody academically. Challenging. I had very good
                    professors from the outset, Clinton Rossiter was one of the great experts on the
                    American presidency, always liked lecturing to undergraduates, I remember that.
                    Full social life, that should not be forgotten. It was legal to drink at 18 in
                    New York State in those days.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Oh absolutely, I mean after my freshman year when I knocked off some of
                    the basics, I started in immediately, I did an amazing course in Russian and
                    Soviet history with Professor Fischer. I did any number of history courses,
                    modern European history with professor Edward Fox.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the election of 1960 which engaged a lot of college
                        students engage you particularly? That was the Kennedy-Nixon.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>MCKEE: Not particularly, I remember listening to the radio or watching on
                    television political conventions going back to '52, when Eisenhower beat Taft.
                    This goes back a long way. The election of '60 engaged me because Eisenhower was
                    seen as very much an old man. I had, by the time elections rolled around in
                    November of 1960, learned a great deal about Richard Nixon, most of which was
                    not very complementary. And of course Kennedy was this handsome dashing romantic
                    young figure. I never went into the Peace Corps, which I regret. I never got
                    involved in the desegregation effort which was just beginning to gather steam
                    when I was at Cornell, which I greatly regret. But Kennedy's emphasis on public
                    service fit right in with my own thinking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a feeling in school that public service was 'A
                        good thing?'</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Absolutely. No doubt about it. I'll never forget, in the mid-'70s, I had
                    some time off for some reason, and State set me up to go lecturing about foreign
                    policy through the Midwest at small colleges. At that point I had had a couple
                    postings in South Asia. I always got questions about the Foreign Service and
                    about public service generally, and I would say it was the greatest thing going.
                    Students did not have that attitude by the mid-'70s, it was a really major
                    shift, maybe pushed by inflation, maybe by the Vietnam war, I don't know what.

                <p>MCKEE: Oh! Good Lord yes, I wrote for the campus newspaper, I edited, eventually,
                    the campus humor magazine, I got elected to a junior honorary, a senior
                    honorary. I was very active in my fraternity, and even now still go back from
                    time to time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What fraternity was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: It was Delta Phi, which was very much an old line fraternity, eastern
                    fraternity. Mostly prep school kids, beautiful old house. I'm conflicted about
                    fraternities, as I think any thoughtful person must be. The positive side as far
                    as I was concerned at Cornell was that the fraternity cut this huge place down
                    to a manageable size, very important, and gave one some initial experiences of
                    leadership and organization. The downside was of course discrimination of
                    various kinds, although I will say that Delta Phi never had any formal
                    discriminatory paragraphs in its charters. While I was there we certainly, we
                    pledged kids from Greece, we pledged kids from Latin America, but nonetheless
                    the essence of the place was preppie, and you knew it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: I really was always focused on a Foreign Service career. I majored in
                    government. I was selected for honors and frankly kicked it away, which I
                    probably shouldn't have done. I applied for the Foreign Service. Given the delay
                    in being accepted and also the desire to avoid being drafted, I started law
                    school in Virginia in the fall of '63, I quit that after about a month. I
                    started a master's degree in history in Virginia, which I finished up in January
                    of '65. I joined the Foreign Service on April Fool's Day, 1965.</p>

                <p>MCKEE: He was quite well known on campus, certainly a revered figure, later among
                    the very earliest of course to engage in teaching against the Vietnam War. And
                    subsequently I've run into any number of Foreign Service officers who were sent
                    by the State Department to Cornell to take his courses and to study Southeast
                    Asia, but that was not an area that I focused on. I did a course in Latin
                    American history and politics, European, but not Southeast Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did, how about, things were beginning to move while you
                        were there in Vietnam, did you get any feedback about Vietnam at all at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well it did begin to move, you know when I got there in '59, the last of
                    the GI Bill guys were still around. Some of them had become sort of permanent
                    students. So there was that reaching back to the Korean War. Clearly Vietnam was
                    becoming more of a concern, but I thought, most everybody I knew thought, that
                    it was the right thing to do. I remember very well our class came into the
                    Foreign Service in April in '65. The big expansion of our presence came in the
                    summer of '65, when we were all still here, pretty much. I can remember only one
                    out of the thirty of us, thirty-odd, saying it's all a big mistake, we shouldn't
                    be doing this. Everybody else basically bought the McNamara-Johnson line.</p>

                <p>MCKEE: I remember one professor who was described as a socialist. I think he may
                    later have been elected mayor of Ithaca on the Democratic ticket, and I'm sure
                    there were such people around. But you have to remember, Cornell was actually a
                    pretty conservative place. First of all, the Agriculture School was large, home
                    economics was large, the industrial and labor relations school was named after
                    Irving Ives, the Republican. The architecture school was fairly conservative in
                    a lot of ways. The government department, which is where you expect to find
                    these guys, also had a fairly conservative cast to it. Rossiter I think was
                    known as a Republican. I took his constitutional law course. Walter Berns was in
                    fact a leading intellectual light of the conservatives.</p>

                <p>MCKEE: Absolutely, I think if you very roughly had to put Cornell somewhere in
                    the political spectrum, Cornell of the late '50s, early '60s, it would have to
                    be centered, leaning somewhat to starboard.</p>

                <p>MCKEE: It was one of the few decisions perhaps that I've never regretted. After
                    about a month of it I said 'Look, this is simply not for me, I don't think the
                    way these people think, and really this is not something I want to do with the

                    slippers.Q: And in getting your master's in history, what area were you in?</p>
                <p>MCKEE: I did mostly 19th, 20th century European. Which is curious because

                    going back, it would have been December of '63. It was fairly rigorous. Oddly
                    enough, my previous trip to Washington, DC, prior to taking the exam, had been
                    to drive up for Kennedy's funeral, which I remember very, very well. With a
                    buddy of mine from law school, I drove up in an old car. we knew nothing about
                    Washington, we parked by the Lincoln Memorial. We walked to Capitol Hill. People

                    hell, came up, stayed at my parent's place. They were living in Dupage County,
                    outside Chicago. I went into the city. I remember having a copy of Time magazine
                    - and I had never realized how gauche that was under my arm. They called my
                    name. I went in and I was put in a witness box. The examiners were sort of en
                    banc, if you will, the three of them up well above my head in this courtroom.
                    They tried to put me at ease and I suspect that I was somewhat at ease. They
                    asked me various questions. One of them, and clearly I thought the sharpest of
                    them, was from the Department of Agriculture. He asked, I thought really very
                    good questions about things I knew a little bit about, like agricultural
                    subsidies and agricultural trade. I remember of course that they said the object
                    was not to show your factual knowledge. You'd already demonstrated that. It was
                    how you handled yourself and all that malarkey. One of the State Department
                    examiners was a man of some wealth and political connections. I later learned
                    that it was said of him that he could say nothing, because he knew nothing, in
                    seven languages. His questions were certainly pedestrian in the extreme. The
                    ones that stick in your mind: if you were in New Orleans, and went due east,
                    what rivers would you cross? Lord knows what the answer to that was. And the
                    classic of course, if you were on a desert island and you could only have a few
                    things, what would they be and why? When I left the room, I remembered two
                    things. I said 'I don't know' often. I thought that would count terribly against
                    me. I was later told that, in fact, it's better not to wing it. The second thing
                    was that my armpits were really wet, so I must have been sweating. Heavily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you came in in April 1st, 1965. Can you, what was
                        the composition of your basic officer's course, your A-100 course?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>MCKEE: Our class was comprised of 32 people, of whom four were, four or five were
                    USIA. There were only maybe four or five women. No members of what we would now
                    call minorities. Average age, you could look it up, was probably something like
                    twenty-five. You couldn't of course be more than thirty-one in those days.
                    Almost all of us wanted to be ambassadors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of this group that, were you talking, you say that the
                        Vietnam war was just on the horizon, or was this a topic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well, it was a topic of conversation, there's no doubt about that. There
                    was concern. President Johnson made the announcement of a major increase in the
                    troop levels, I think it jumped from what, twenty-five thousand to a
                    hundred-thousand. People were concerned, but there was this very strong sense
                    that it was the right thing to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the course? Did it meet your
                        expectations, or did you have any expectations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: The course director was a guy named Garret Soulen, and it was of course a
                    series of talking heads. It mostly took place in Rosslyn. I thought that the
                    accommodations were, you know, it was limited to office space, it was really
                    pretty funny. I got the first sense of the importance of the federal budget in
                    my future when it was announced quite suddenly that our class trip would be to
                    the Port of Baltimore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Normally you go up to New York.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: At least New York! But this was a cutback. Soulen, Garret Soulen actually
                    did a good job, I thought. Brought in good speakers, and made us all, at least
                    once, possibly twice, get up and address the entire class. I have felt for as
                    long as I've been in the Foreign Service that one area which has been neglected,
                    and unfortunately so, is to train people to speak well in public. I think that
                    they should develop programs and devote more resources to doing so. We have some
                    wretched public speakers in key positions in the Foreign Service. Now, when I
                    was in high school I also worked at a state park, Old Fort Niagara, where the
                    Niagara River flows into Lake Ontario. I was a guide. I developed not only
                    fearlessness with regard to public speaking but also a tremendous sense of the
                    power of the microphone, and perhaps that influenced my confidence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that you were at University of Illinois, how
                        long were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>MCKEE: As I dropped out of law school at UVA, I bounced around. I went into grad
                    school. They said that, well you can only take nine hours because these courses
                    are really tough, so I took only nine hours. Which is a big mistake. I remember
                    going up to New York for a month and coming back and feeling like I hadn't
                    missed a damn thing. And I aced all those courses. But by then the money was
                    running out. My parents were Illinois residents, so Champagne-Urbana was a
                    cheaper place to go. So I went there for summer school, and I remember I took
                    something like ten hours in summer school, and then I took a heavy load in the
                    fall and finished up my master's degree then, in the fall-winter semester.
                    Pretty grim, I mean Champagne-Urbana is, all said and done, a pretty grim place.
                    I had some roommates in an apartment that I didn't like very much. I was really
                    just waiting to get into the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In, when you came in, were you thinking of any place to
                        go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: You know I hate to say it, but I had at the time massive debts. Can you
                    believe that I owed my parents six hundred bucks for my master's degree? And I
                    really wanted to go to a place where I could make some money. I can't remember
                    what I put in for. My French was pretty good from grade school and high school.
                    Anyway I can't remember whether I put in for La Paz or whether I was sent there
                    or whatever, but I was quite happy because it was a twenty-five percent hardship
                    post and it was exotic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to La Paz when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: I went to La Paz fairly early on, it would have been like November of '65.
                    In other words, I had the A-100 course, the consular course in which I did not
                    do well, four months of Spanish, and I was off to La Paz.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were in La Paz from '65 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: '66, just a year, because again the budget struck, my second lesson of the
                    importance of the budget in my life. I had done six months in the USO section
                    and six months in the political section. All of us rotational junior officers,
                    were transferred to funded positions. I was transferred to Barranquilla,
                    Colombia. Which I had to look up on a map. I didn't know where it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in La Paz, what did, how did, what was sort of the
                        situation in La Paz as you saw it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>MCKEE: Well, I was surprised, I remember, that Bolivia had relations with any
                    other foreign country, because we were so important. I was really surprised that
                    they even bothered having relations with places like Britain and Israel and
                    Brazil. We were it. It's really provincial, but somehow it did come as a shock
                    that there were all these other foreign embassies in town. The Embassy itself
                    physically was in the Banco National, an old building with rickety elevators and
                    a buzzer bell that would give you a shock if it was raining. The electricity
                    just was not very well insulated. The Ambassador was a fine man, Douglas
                    Henderson, still alive. His wife Dorothy was a very warm woman. It was his first
                    and as it turned out only ambassadorship. He was very much an ARA type, very
                    distinguished, very nice guy. The DCM was a guy named Bob Hurwich, whom I
                    remember very well. One of his daughters, he had several daughters, got into
                    various kinds of scrapes when he was in Bolivia. But he was, I remember, he was
                    a good DCM. He later got into a lot of trouble. He called all of us junior
                    officers together, he really did look out for us. His own story I remember very
                    distinctly. He'd served in the Army in World War II, and didn't even know that
                    there were embassies, frankly. But he found out, thought it was a good way of
                    life, got into the Foreign Service, worked his way up. I remember him saying
                    'You know, if you keep your nose clean and work hard, you might get an
                    ambassadorship. But if you don't you will have had a very interesting career.' I
                    liked Hurwich a lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall what was the problem with him later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: I remember distinctly. He later served as DAS for the Caribbean, maybe
                    under Carter, I'm not sure, and then as Ambassador to the Dominican Republic.
                    While he was Ambassador to the Dominican Republic he accepted a piece of land,
                    beachfront property, for a dollar from a very prominent Dominican businessman.
                    He started to build what would be his vacation retirement home there, using
                    Embassy labor, using the assistant GSO to supervise. In a very short period of
                    time this came back to Washington. He was called back here, put on trial in at
                    the federal courthouse in Alexandria. Deprived of his pension, I think didn't do
                    any jail time, and quite possibly he was fined as well. A bad ending.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It really is, you wonder what happened. Well, it's sort of
                        obvious you don't do that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: I really, I have a theory about why it happened, but since it's so
                    personal I'd rather not go into it, it involves, essentially involves his
                    family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you get out and sort of mix and mingle in the
                        Bolivian society?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>MCKEE: Absolutely! One of the best jobs I ever had, in all my years was, that the
                    Ambassador, bless his heart, made me the Secretary of the Ambassador's Emergency
                    Fund Committee. In those days, and I guess the amount hasn't risen much, the
                    Ambassador has twenty-five thousand dollars a year to play with. Now, we had an
                    AID mission there, but this committee existed and everybody in Bolivia knew
                    about it. Groups of campesinos would send in requests for assistance. The
                    maximum grant I think was a thousand bucks, which was a lot of money in those
                    days. 'We've half-finished our school, it's been a bad year, the crops have
                    failed, could you possibly come up with five-hundred dollars so we could put a
                    roof on the school?' The project that I will never forget is this one. Bolivia
                    had a very small winery operation, and there had been floods, and this is all in
                    the pre-cocaine days. The little terraces that kept the vines in place had been
                    destroyed, could we come up with money to repair them? And I would have to go
                    and look at these projects, and it was wonderful, took me all over the
                    country.Q: I always think of Bolivia as having a bunch of miners running around
                    with sticks of dynamite stuck in their belts. I mean, did that, that sort of
                    thing...</p>
                <p>MCKEE: Oh, yes, Bolivia had had its social revolution in '52 and tossed out the
                    landowner class, members of the aristocracy who went overseas or moved to the
                    cities of Bolivia. Mining was the backbone of the economy. The miners were
                    nearly all in the MNR or parties that were friendly to the Left. Yes, they
                    descended on the major cities from time to time. There were several
                    counterweights politically to the miners. In Santa Cruz province and other
                    provinces down in the flatlands were large landowners who were of course
                    conservative. The church was very weak, unlike in other places in South America.
                    There had been a revolution, I think just before I got there. By then Ren�
                    Barrientos Ortu�o had come in as co-President and then as sole President. But
                    one could still see the marks of the shots on the wall of the University
                    campus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, how did you see the university at that time,
                        Latin American universities sometimes can be places you can't go to, real
                        hotbeds of leftism and all that, was that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: That was pretty much true. The University of San Andr�s, big place, not
                    far from the Embassy. Certainly no-one ever said it was off limits to me, but I
                    never went there, and I had the sense that it was a dangerous place for an
                    American diplomat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any coups while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: No. Barrientos Ortu�o was in office the entire time I was there. He died,
                    I think, in a helicopter crash. But after I did my GSO stint for six months I
                    was put in the political section. I was asked to watch the Congress, which was a
                    pretty anemic organization. I actually got to know one or two or three of the
                    congressmen very well. I had a marvelous boss, Larry Pezzullo, who I just saw
                    recently, still a truly outstanding person.Q: Who was this?</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>MCKEE: Larry Pezzullo, Latin Americanist, always wanted to get back to Vietnam,
                    never did as far as I know. Very good Ambassador to Uruguay and then
                    particularly to Nicaragua at the time that the Somoza regime was collapsing.
                    Immensely capable guy.</p>

                <p>MCKEE: I missed that, I missed that. He was captured in Bolivia in the spring of
                    '67, by which time I was in Colombia. During the year that I was in Bolivia, I'm
                    pretty sure in retrospect, the CIA knew that he was there, but I didn't know he
                    was there.</p>

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>MCKEE: Well this Project Hope was the inspiration of a father and son team of
                    doctors named Walsh. They persuaded the US government to give them two hospital
                    ships, which they then, through charitable contributions, raised money to fix
                    up. They sent these around the world. The idea was that Project Hope, which was
                    headquartered in Winchester, Virginia, would way in advance send out a team to a
                    particular place, Sri Lanka or Colombia or some other place, talk to the local
                    medical establishment, gain its confidence, find out areas in which it could
                    send its ships for ten months, to be essentially a teaching hospital for the
                    local medical establishment. This required a pretty high level of diplomatic
                    skill, by the way. Then the ship would come, it would dock. American doctors
                    would take off a month or two, fly to wherever this was, practice their
                    specialty. Obviously the ship didn't take local folks with colds or broken arms.
                    It took people who had, what was seen as interesting, tropical diseases, or
                    diseases of the area. I think it was usually the tropics. As the vice consul I
                    had to go to Cartagena, Colombia, which was ninety miles away from Barranquilla
                    every other Friday. I would sign seamen on and off the Hope Ship. The ships were
                    crewed by Grace and company. Peter Grace being a devout Catholic, as were the
                    Walsh's. Of course Grace and Company was a major U.S. shipping line. I learned
                    how important unions were then. All of these seamen were unionized, and I
                    remember they got about six hundred bucks a month, not counting room and board
                    and clothes, which were provided. I remember thinking to myself at the time that
                    if I had an idiot son I'd work my butt off to get him into the seamen's union,
                    because it was, well, an easy life. The seamen were seamen. The Grace Company
                    management argued that they were essentially a bunch of drunks and malingerers,
                    and certainly that was often the case. The most interesting aspect of it was
                    that they served two month stints on the ship, and then they had to be sent back
                    to Miami, because the ship was just sitting in port. X number of them had to be
                    employed, according to union rules, mostly chipping paint. It was my obligation
                    as the vice consul to make sure that their allowances were paid to various
                    dependants. I learned there that it is really true, that sailors really do have
                    a girl in every port. And I would solemnly check to make sure that Mazie in
                    Panama City got her fifteen dollars, and Amparo in some place, some port in
                    Nicaragua, got her twenty-five dollars, all of this from the same seaman, which
                    I thought was very interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did, Barranquilla, what was the sort of the center of
                        activity there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>MCKEE: It was a commercial place. Barranquilla is about fifteen miles upriver
                    from the mouth of the Magdalena, where the Magdalena River, a mighty river,
                    drains almost half of Columbia, flows into the Caribbean. There had been a very
                    tiny town earlier, but the entire history of the place dates from 1920. I assume
                    the Colombian government, not the locals, floated a large bond issue, mostly in
                    Chicago. This was subscribed, and it raised enough money to build a large
                    breakwater out into the Caribbean. This made Barranquilla an ocean port. And so
                    shipping was its main occupation. There was industry as well. Really, except for
                    a very few small buildings downtown, all of it dated from the 1920s. Not a
                    particularly attractive city. To the east was Santa Marta, which is a very
                    historical town in a very lovely setting. And to the west was Cartagena, which
                    was a fortress of the Spanish Main, in the eighteenth century, again a very
                    dramatic kind of place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What, other than the care and feeding of the seamen, what
                        other sorts of things were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: I was a visa officer. Almost anybody could scrape up a hundred bucks,
                    which is what it cost to fly from Barranquilla to Miami in those days, so we
                    turned down a lot of visas. I did immigrant visas as well. Occasionally took
                    care of American citizens. We had what we called it the widows' and orphans'
                    fund. Whenever there was money left over from some party or something we'd toss
                    it in there, and we used this money if somebody needed a hotel room for a night,
                    until they'd take the plane out the next morning, didn't have any money. The
                    inspectors came through and said we couldn't keep it, this was all against the
                    regs, so we had to get rid of it, it was unappropriated funds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. So you were trying to hide it somewhere.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well, we didn't, I don' t know, we didn't hide it. The other thing, I was
                    asked to clear out some old files, and I did so. Bundled stuff off and sent it
                    to Washington. These files actually went back to the '40s, and they were
                    absolutely fascinating, even in the '40s, because of the effort to combat Nazi
                    and Italian fascist shipping and whatever. We had consulates in Cartagena and
                    Santa Marta as well was Barranquilla. The locals told me that they remembered
                    the FBI got in at that time, who were very obvious because they all had brush
                    cuts and wore short-sleeved shirts and ties and nobody else in town did. They
                    also couldn't speak Spanish, which sort of gave them away. But, above all, all
                    the angry correspondence among the three consuls, each accusing the other of
                    giving ten pesos to some American citizen deadbeat, which would have been enough
                    to get him into the next consular district. Really quite humorous.</p>

                        don't let it happen in my Consular district' is the Consul's prayer. And if
                        it does happen you hope that somehow or another it can be moved to somebody
                        else's district.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: We were just three, the consul, who was essentially a South Asia expert,
                    his French-Algerian wife, myself. I was then single, got married while I was
                    there. The other vice consul, who went on to a very distinguished career, and
                    whom I saw the other day for the first time in decades, here at DACOR of which
                    he is a member. Also a regional Peace Corps director, a family named Hogan, to
                    whom I was really close, and USIA had a bi-national center director in town. A
                    total of five.</p>

                <p>MCKEE: Consul.</p>

                        drinking problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>MCKEE: It was very difficult. It was one of those situations which has only
                    happened once or twice in my life. In the first interview, I talked to him, he
                    talked to me, and it seemed clear to me from the outset that we wouldn't get
                    along, and essentially we didn't. He was a nervous guy, very concerned about his
                    career, had family problems, drank too much, which is particularly a bad idea in
                    the tropics. Now mind you, up until five years ago I probably drank too much, so
                    it's the pot calling the kettle black. He had a demanding eye in terms of
                    details and respect and all of that. There were two low points. Bob, the consul,
                    had taken the consulate car and driver, a short guy who could barely see over
                    the windshield, and his wife, and was driving to Cartagena. There was this spot
                    in the road where the pavement had given way, and the driver hit that full
                    force, and Bob and his pregnant wife and the driver went head over heels as the
                    car rolled over, off the road. Well, they all recovered, thank God Suzie didn't
                    lose the baby, but I said 'Look, we've gotta get rid of this driver.' And I had
                    worked it out with the Consulate doctor, the guy who interviewed the immigrant
                    visa people, that the guy in fact had had TB, and the scars were still on his
                    lungs, and I said to Bob 'Come on, why don't we just let him go. The doctor will
                    say that you never really know with TB, the scars are still very much there. It
                    could become active again.' I had it greased, the admin guys in Bogota were all
                    set, he'd retire, he'd get a pension, and we get a driver who could see over the
                    goddamn windshield.' Bob wouldn't buy it. So we continued to employ that driver.
                    Well, he was driving me to Cartagena some months later, he hit exactly the same
                    goddamn spot in the road and the car rolled over again, and I remember a
                    ballpoint pen went through the soft fleshy part of my hand. We were okay.
                    Incredibly enough, they were able to roll the car back up onto the road and we
                    were able to get back to Barranquilla in some shape, and I was furious. I was
                    scared too, frankly, but I was furious. I went directly to his house, and it was
                    about two blocks from where I lived - unwashed, oil stains, blood, what have
                    you. I knocked on the door. Bob came to the door, he was giving a reception, I
                    said to Bob, 'Exactly the same spot where this guy almost killed your wife, he
                    almost killed me, he's got to go.' Bob's reaction, I shall never forget this,
                    was 'You're bleeding on my carpet.' It was not a happy two years.Q: You
                    mentioned you met your wife there, how did that happen?</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>MCKEE: No, not really, I met my wife in Bolivia, where she was an FSN, and I
                    proposed marriage to her while we were still there. While I was in Barranquilla,
                    I went through the process of seeking permission to marry an alien, which of
                    course is legally the correct definition. It always reminded me of somebody from
                    Mars. Anyway, the bureaucracy was very slow to move and my fianc�e made wedding
                    preparations. So I remember, I remember distinctly nothing had happened. So
                    finally on a Wednesday I telegraphed them saying 'I'm leaving on Friday to get
                    married on this coming Saturday, Friday night civil ceremony, Saturday church
                    ceremony in La Paz.' And just before I left the Department sent back a cable
                    saying 'Permission to marry granted. Letter follows.' Which I don't think I have
                    anymore, but I had it for years, the copy of this telegram. Bob Carle, who is
                    now dead, been dead for some time, he was my boss. He was this guy that I had a
                    very difficult relationship with. But he gave me one piece of advice which was
                    absolutely on the mark and for which I remain indebted to him to this day. He
                    sat me down, just the night before I left, he said 'You know, you're marrying a
                    Latin American woman, and I wish you well.' He said 'I really think you should
                    not make Latin America your Foreign Service career.' And I asked him why. And
                    Bob said 'Look, I'm married to a foreign woman, and I'll tell you, if you marry
                    this woman in Latin America, if you stay in Latin America, the other American
                    wives will make life difficult for her, don't think they won't. Any success that
                    you achieve, there will be those who will say 'Well, he did this because his
                    wife speaks the language and she's from here and she has all these connections
                    that other officers with American wives don't have.' He said, 'I really think
                    you ought to go somewhere else.' And I did, I put in for Farsi, Arabic or
                    Turkish training. Basically it was a way of getting out of Latin America, and I
                    think Bob was right. I pray desperately that things have improved, and I'm sure
                    they have, but when I was there in the late '60s', mid-'60s', there was an awful
                    lot of contempt in the State Department for the Latin Americans. I think some of
                    it verged on racism. ARA was really in a lot of ways a place I didn't want to
                    be.Q: I must say, I sensed this immediately, the sort of thing you pick up in
                    the corridors. Part of it was that if you, I'm not sure it was racism, because I
                    didn't feel that, but I think the problem was that once you went there, sort of
                    a black hole, you never appeared, you never went anywhere else, I mean there are
                    so many posts you could go to, and the other thing was that quite frankly on our
                    Foreign Policy radar it ranked pretty low. I mean Latin America, you know, every
                    once in awhile something might come up but basically when you look at the
                    problems of the Middle East or Asia or even particularly the Soviet Union and
                    all, I mean these were the things that really engaged officers.</p>
                <p>MCKEE: I think that's true. I think that people specialize in ARA because Spanish
                    and Portuguese were frankly easy languages to learn. And in those days, this is
                    all pre-drugs and pre-terrorism, except for plane hijacking, it was pretty easy
                    duty. You could save money, have servants in the house. I suspect that people,
                    the Arabists, the Kremlinologists, the NATO types, did look down on ARA. Once
                    you're sort of in there, this is another point that bugged me, this is your
                    second Latin American tour. I may be exaggerating here, but you know you do one
                    more, and you'll never get out.</p>

                    Consul's wife, but by that point I pretty much had my onward assignment. Out of
                    the three languages I'd asked for they gave me Hindi. This would have been '68,
                    '69. I did Hindi at FSI in Rosslyn. The onward assignment was five years, if you
                    please, in India. I also did Urdu, you know basically the two languages at the
                    spoken level are the same, the two scripts are very different. So I got out, I
                    went to what was then NEA.</p>

                    obviously, not Persian. I can't reconstruct the thought process, but you do have
                    to recall that that was still the heyday of CENTO, that was the time of a
                    massive U.S. economic assistance presence in Pakistan and India. Pakistan and
                    India were more on the scope perhaps then than Latin America was, to get back to

                    a Sikh, which I thought was rather bizarre. Later I learned, in fact, people
                    from the Punjab of a certain age actually often did know Urdu quite well, so it
                    wasn't as bizarre as it seemed to me. And I went off to India really with a
                    great sense of enthusiasm, with a sense of maybe a second start in the Foreign
                    Service.</p>

                <p>MCKEE: Yes, pretty much. Q: And Afghanistan people, I mean was there a corps?</p>
                <p>MCKEE: There was, there was. There was a little bit of a feeling that they were
                    sort of second class in NEA, because of course the real hotshots in NEA were
                    always doing Arab-Israeli stuff. But yes, within the bureau, of the three Deputy
                    Assistant Secretaries, one was always the guy with South Asian experience, I met
                    Howie Schaffer early on, and our friendship has gone on now these many decades.
                    We still see each other from time to time. And you know he was of course a major
                    figure in the Foreign Service in dealing with what was then called the Indian
                    Subcontinent, but which is now called South Asia. And he certainly influenced me
                    positively with regard to a post in India.</p>

                <p>MCKEE: It was all New Delhi, I was in New Delhi for five years, '69 to '74.</p>

                        mention, if you were picking up, while you were there, taking Urdu and all,
                        were you picking up, well I can ask you now, were you picking up any
                        emanations of the Vietnam war, I mean things, you'd been away, did
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Oh, yes, it was a hell of a year, '68, '69 was a hell of a year in
                    Washington. There were demonstrations practically every day, and clearly
                    opposition to the war had come front and center.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well, you know, I took my responsibilities very seriously. Later, when I
                    became a supervisor, more than once had to remind subordinates that when you're
                    working for the U.S. government, privately you can voice your doubts, but you
                    had to be very careful about who you voice those doubts to. Publicly you support
                    the policy.</p>

                        Delhi. Great.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is the 28th of May, 2002. We're off to New Delhi in 1969. How long were you
                    in New Delhi?</p>
                <p>MCKEE: Five years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good God! To '74? I don't know, maybe we'll come here, but
                        how did this assignment come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: I had mentioned earlier to you that I got very good advice from my boss in
                    Latin America about marrying a Latin American woman, which was to get the hell
                    out of Latin America. Wanting to do so, I remember very distinctly putting in to
                    study a hard language, Arabic, Farsi, or Turkish. As the roll of the dice would
                    have it, it was Hindi, and also Urdu, so I did that for a year in the old,
                    unventilated, ill-lit buildings rented by FSI in Rosslyn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the garage.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: No, this was actually above the garage. I remember that I was up, several
                    floors up, still pretty grim surroundings. But then after that year, I qualified
                    in Hindi and Urdu actually, at a low level. I think the Hindi was 3/3, and the
                    Urdu was 2/2. The assignment was for four years to New Delhi. As things worked
                    out, I stayed an extra year because Daniel Patrick Moynihan came and I was
                    having a lot of fun. So I stayed, all told, five years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well let's see, 1969, what was the situation, let's
                        talk about India when you went there, both vis a vis relations with the
                        United States and India in the world and internally.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>MCKEE: Well, India at that point, politically, was still recovering from the
                    death of Nehru and then the death of Prime Minister Shastri, who had succeeded
                    him and lasted only about fifteen months before dying in Tashkent. Mrs. Gandhi
                    had been chosen by the Congress Party barons to lead the party. They were
                    thinking that she was some malleable young lady, and she turned out to be indeed
                    far from that. But when I was there she was asserting herself. For example, soon
                    after I got there she decreed that the Congress Party government would end the
                    privy purses that were given out to the princes. This was seen as a sharp move
                    to the left. She had never been fond of the United States. She in many ways had
                    both rightist disdain for our sort of humble-jumble society, and of course she
                    had a leftist disdain, maybe a socialist disdain for our economic system. But
                    nonetheless, relations at that point were very good. Chester Bowles was still
                    Ambassador. He was very popular. The Peace Corps had over seven hundred
                    volunteers in India. The AID mission was all over, including in about a half a
                    dozen state agricultural universities with teams from some of our state
                    agriculture universities. There was a program between the Massachusetts
                    Institute of Technology, and the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, which
                    was going very well. All of this in the context of a contest with the Soviets
                    for the affections of the Indians. However, as the situation went from bad to
                    worse in East Pakistan, culminating in essentially the disenfranchisement of the
                    East Pakistanis before Bhutto became Prime Minister, when Yahya Khan was still
                    there. Hundreds of thousands of refugees poured into India. And we, in that
                    famous phrase, tilted toward Pakistan in that conflict.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I'd like to go back earlier, before the '69, what,
                        when you went out there, what was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: That was actually curious. I was supposed to be an economic officer, but I
                    was hauled into the front office to be the Staff Aide to the Staff Aide to the
                    Ambassador. The Staff Aide was Richard Viets, and the Ambassador was Chester
                    Bowles. And that's what I did. Bowles left and Ken Keating came, but I stayed in
                    that position for about six months. I was not really very successful in it, and
                    shifted over to the economic section, the section where I spent about a year and
                    a half.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What, when you arrived in '69, what was the perception of
                        Indira Gandhi, from our perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: I don't think Americans had a very clear view of Indira Gandhi at that
                    point. Nixon made a visit, he came to India, soon after he was elected he came
                    to India in '69, but it was pretty clear that he and Mrs. Gandhi did not get
                    along well. I think the U.S. government saw her as a possibly transitory figure
                    on the left and not well disposed to the United States.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Vietnam war, this is at the very height of the
                        anti-Vietnam business, did that, how did that play out when you
                        arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well, it was a very negative factor. I mean the Indians thought that we
                    were dead wrong and had no compunctions about telling us so. That certainly
                    didn't go down well in Washington.Q: Did, how did, what was your impression of
                    Chester Bowles and how he dealt and perceived the Indian government at that
                    time?</p>
                <p>MCKEE: I was there only at the very end, and I don't think our tours overlapped
                    by more than six or eight weeks, so I'm really hesitant to say anything. He was
                    an iconic figure. He'd been Ambassador before, certainly loved it. He was a
                    controversial figure, as was Steb, his wife, in the American community. Steb
                    always dressed in a sari and there was a sort of going native feeling about
                    them, and it went down badly with an awful lot of Foreign Service Officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's almost a tradition of our Ambassadors very much of
                        serving the Indian side of things and all. Was that something that we were
                        seeing, do you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Oh, I think that that was perceived in Washington, yes. I think that our
                    reporting, our political and economic reporting was seen as being unduly
                    generous to the Indians. We had a huge AID mission there, there were a lot of
                    jobs on the line. So it did color the quality of the reporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might add that I saw reports that, there was a feeling
                        today where tensions were extremely high between India and Pakistan that our
                        embassies seemed to be dueling with each other, the one in Islamabad and the
                        one in New Delhi. Was there all that feeling when you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Absolutely. One was seen as either an Indian partisan or a Pakistani
                    partisan, and that played out between the two embassies. As the conditions in
                    East Pakistan deteriorated, that became stronger and stronger. You had the
                    Embassy in Delhi reporting that the Indians were being forced by the influx of
                    refugees and by the need to secure their eastern border to take steps which
                    would effectively assist the rebels. Our Ambassador, Joe Farland in Islamabad at
                    that time, was very close to the Yahya Kahn, who was telling him that it would
                    all be over shortly and it was just a bunch of disgruntled malcontents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find, as a Staff Assistant to the Staff
                        Assistant, how did you find dealing with the, did you get involved with the
                        Indian Foreign Ministry or the bureaucracy down there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Not at that time, I did later on when I was in the political section, and
                    the economic section, but I didn't as a Staff Aide.</p>

                <p>MCKEE: Institute of Technology at Kanpur.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we seeing at that time India as being one of the
                        world's great repositories of sort of engineering minds and scientific minds
                        or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: No, no, I think that was a much later perception. I think at that time
                    India was seen as, and this is very much a fallacy, as democratic India that was
                    the response to Communist China. By assisting India we were showing that a
                    democracy could also deliver the goods.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we see, the sort of marriage between the Soviet
                        Union and India was seen to be, not a marriage made in heaven, they seem to
                        be on different sides, it almost seems like they were, the relations between
                        the two seem to be more designed as against the United States than you know
                        a natural liking for each other.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well I think that's true, the linkage between the two was very much an
                    elite thing. It goes back to Nehru, who visited the Soviet Union in the '20s or
                    in the '30s. There was this sort of romantic Fabian leftism, anti-imperialist
                    rhetoric and what have you. And then after the '60-'62 war between India and
                    China, Russia, the Soviet Union, was very much seen in New Delhi as the
                    counterbalance to China, and later also to Pakistan. One of my jobs was to put
                    together this massive report on East Bloc economic and technical assistance to
                    India every year. No question in my mind that the Russian technicians and their
                    families, Russian diplomats, were seen as racist and cheap and were generally
                    quite unpopular. The more sophisticated Indians realized that they were getting
                    second rate technology, that they could get better technology from the United
                    States. But we had declined after a long almost theological fight to permit one
                    of our steel companies to transfer technology for a steel mill to India, and
                    that still rankled. The decision that had been made in the mid-'60s then, but
                    the bitter residue certainly was still there. The Russians built two steel mills
                    for the Indians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In those days steel mills were considered to be the crown
                        jewels or whatever, they were a great project, they looked big, and they
                        employed a lot of people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Exactly. Even if, as in the case of India, it was cheaper to import the
                    coal from Poland than it was to use Indian coal, and the economics of it didn't
                    really make much sense.</p>

                        strong cadre of what you would call Indian hands or was there a cadre of
                        subcontinent hands?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Subcontinent hands, but there were some very impressive people there. Herb
                    Hagerty was in his second or third tour there, Grant Smith had been raised
                    there. His father was an AID officer. A very distinguished guy, his name has

                <p>MCKEE: Well Bowles certainly was a romantic about India, I think. And then he
                    left, and of course Ken Keating came. Ken was a very different kind of figure,
                    but there were certainly people in the AID mission and in the embassy who were
                    emotionally committed to the success of India, and economic development.</p>

                <p>MCKEE: Well let's see, I arrived in the summer of '69, it would have been in
                    early '70, and I probably stayed for the summer of '71, so about a year and a

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well I think I, I think I shared the general appreciation that, as Patrick
                    Moynihan who later became Ambassador, said, socialism is a luxury that only rich
                    countries could afford. India really couldn't afford this sort of state
                    socialist autarkic system that was prevalent there. There is a very strong
                    memory in my mind. There was a Sikh entrepreneur, Manmohan Singh. Not the very
                    well known Manmohan Singh, but another Manmohan Singh. But he was a Carrier, air
                    conditioning, refrigeration representative in India, and was once called upon to
                    testify before a committee of the Loksabha, which was my main beat. I covered
                    domestic politics.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Loksabha being...MCKEE: Being the lower house of the
                        Indian Parliament, the House of the People. And about joint ventures and
                        partnership and things like that. And I actually got to sit in on the
                        session as an observer committee, I thought it was really fascinating,
                        because here was this very sharp entrepreneur-capitalist, very much at home
                        in the West, explaining to fairly ignorant Members of Parliament, but also
                        others who were quite committed ideologically that just because you put in
                        fifty-one percent of a venture didn't mean that you ran it, ran roughshod
                        over the representatives of forty-nine percent. It wasn't like a democratic
                        system where fifty-one percent gives you total control. Then there was the
                        whole question about technology transfer, which these parliamentarians
                        clearly envisioned as, “You pay some money and then somebody gives you a
                        whole bunch of documents and then you go out and do stuff.” They really
                        didn't have a clue about how dynamic a process it was. Manmohan Singh kept
                        it up, and it was clearly missionary work, because except for very small
                        minority communities like the Parsis, most didn't have a clue when it came
                        to the larger market-oriented world.</hi>

                        have this sort of thing at their finger, many of them have it at their

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Part of it may be that the way the caste system works, very gruesome. Some
                    groups do one thing and some groups do another, those who do politics, some do
                    economics. Those who do export-import trade in Bombay or in the ports don't do
                    agriculture production. I don't know, but certainly there were, because there
                    were very sophisticated people in terms of the Indian merchant community, and
                    like the Chinese there were diaspora Indians with whom you could set up
                    relationships. Actually the foreign trade of both countries considered as a
                    percentage of GNP was a joke.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well this is deliberate, wasn't it? It was self-production
                        and self internal-selling and that sort of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Import substitution was a huge theme when I was there. I often though that
                    precious foreign exchange was always one word in Indian-English, because you
                    never saw foreign exchange without the adjective “precious.” The idea that we
                    should be self- sufficient and not depend on the west for anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you seeing India as having something that if they
                        were to take sort of government controls off they could take off, or at that
                        point was the economy such that, they weren't ready for that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>MCKEE: I think that the feeling was very strongly that if they took off the
                    controls, the economy would take off. There were some true success stories, but
                    not so much in the industrial-commercial field. The introduction of triple-dwarf
                    wheat by American AID experts in Punjab meant that every year the harvest was up
                    by fifteen to twenty percent from what it had been. But one of the underlying
                    reasons for that was land reform. In East Punjab, as opposed to Pakistani
                    Punjab, there were very few farms that were larger than forty acres, and they
                    were intensively farmed. Land reform, particularly in Punjab and then in western
                    Uttar Pradesh, was carried out in a way that ensured that those who received the
                    land also received capital and fertilizer and technical assistance. It was not
                    just enough to give a peasant a piece of land, they'd lose it in no time. You've
                    got to give them all these other things as well, make them available.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you there when there was the shift from being a
                        food deficit country to a food surplus country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Yes, yes. In the mid-'60s, we had shipped massive amounts of grain to both
                    India and Pakistan because the monsoon failed two years in a row, and certainly
                    by the early '70s, '71, India was self-sufficient in grain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did, was this the beginning of that monumental surplus of

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well the counterpart money was really built up in the '60s by the
                    shipments of grain. I think I may have mentioned the great accomplishment of
                    Daniel Patrick Moynihan as Ambassador was to reach an agreement whereby those
                    funds were dissipated over a relatively short period of time, about ten or
                    twelve years.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Oh, absolutely, and especially after the Indo-Pakistan War, when of course
                    our relations reached rock bottom. The Left and the Congress and the two-odd
                    Communist Parties beat us over the head with the PL-480 rupees every day.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let's talk about the '71 war, how did, was there a

                        this thing can't last, India can't sit by and watch this and it was almost
                        inevitable that they would get involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Oh, very much so. And we were privy to the reporting coming out of our
                    Consulate General in Dacca. Who was there...?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Arch Blood.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Arch Blood was there. And it was very clear that conditions in East
                    Pakistan were going from bad to worse. To some extent I'm sure that RAW, the
                    Indian intelligence agents, exacerbated the situation. In many ways they really
                    didn't have to. The Pakistan Army was doing quite enough on its own to
                    exacerbate it. And I think the sentiment in the Embassy was that the Indians
                    were forced to intervene finally in December of '71.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How, how did that, it was done rather quickly, wasn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Once the Indian Army intervened, I think it was done in a manner of six
                    weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern, did this spill into the other borders
                        with West Pakistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well I've never been quite sure how that would have happened. Certainly
                    Henry Kissinger was quite concerned that the Indians would move across and would
                    move into West Pakistan, but for whatever reason Indians decided not to do so.
                    Possibly because we sent our aircraft carrier, I think it was the Enterprise,
                    into the Bay of Bengal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that tilt towards Pakistan affect, sort of the
                        carrier came and all that. Was there sort of a freeze on contacts, did it
                        have any real effect that you saw?</hi>

                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>MCKEE: Social relations were occasionally bad. I remember one night that I drank
                    too much and actually decked an Indian journalist who, I thought was getting
                    obnoxious about Vietnam and Bengal and all of that. The Indians had a very
                    professional Foreign Service. Obnoxious sometimes, and condescending, but
                    professional, so there was every effort made to maintain a sort of civility.Q:
                    Did, was there any concern on behalf of the American community in the Embassy
                    during the war that you...</p>
                <p>MCKEE: Oh, absolutely. First of all, we all had to cover up our windows with
                    black paper or black paint. Ditto with the headlights of our cars. The
                    Australians were so afraid of being taken for Americans that they sort of had
                    large Australian flag decals that they put on their cars. We were very
                    unpopular.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did, was there, I don't want to say rebellion, but was
                        there unhappiness in the Embassy because of that sort of pro-Pakistan on the
                        part of Henry Kissinger and company?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: I really don't recall. It's logical to infer that but I don't recall
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Part of the reason behind our siding with Pakistan was to

                <p>MCKEE: We know now.</p>

                <p>MCKEE: It's really inconceivable. I mean it's not for nothing that “Nixon to
                    China” has become a stock phrase in politics.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: My specialized, special area shows you how elaborate the Embassy staffing
                    was and how large in those days. My special area was into two fields, one was
                    the Soviet bloc economic assistance, and the other one was barter trade, what
                    was called rupee trade. So many pairs of badly made Indian shoes for so many
                    Russian tanks that didn't fire straight. I did a lot of writing on essentially
                    non-monetized trade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you sort of able to, in some way or another get a

                <p>MCKEE: Oh, yes, they were quite visible. At one point, the state trading agency,
                    one of many, had cut a deal with the Bulgarians, and in return for some product
                    that they sent to Bulgaria they got back all of this Bulgarian brandy which was
                    undrinkable stuff. Whenever you went to the state hotel, that's what they tried
                    to get you to take, because they had boxcars full of the stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about, what sort of social relations did you find,
                        were you able to make good contact or was it a time when you were kind of

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: No, my memory is that social contacts remained very strong. Yes,
                    occasional sharp exchanges, but Indians quite willing to take refuge in that old
                    line 'We like you, it's your government we can't stand.'</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: I think there wasn't much understanding. The great change in the
                    Immigration Act took place only in '66, '67, and so the impact had not at all
                    been felt.</p>

                    year for Pakistan. And of course the changes that took place in the '60s then
                    opened the way. By '69, '70, '71 the brain drain had become a concern in India.
                    It was more brain drain towards Europe, particularly England, than there was
                    brain drain towards the United States.</p>

                <p>MCKEE: Still. Yes. I think that was beginning to change even at that time. Again
                    the impact of something like having Ohio State people at the state university.
                    MIT, had a tremendous trickle-down effect on the way that Indians thought, but
                    they were a typical post-colonial society in that sense, educationally.</p>

                        action did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Domestic politics, almost everything except Kashmir, coordinating the
                    reporting of the three consulates general. It was a marvelous job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I would think it would be.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Traveled a lot. I was myself responsible for reporting on state politics
                    in the Delhi consular district, which was a big job. There were very bright
                    officers in the consulates, Peter Burleigh in Calcutta, for example.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Karelia, is that the way you pronounce it, or Karalla,
                        was that a place we were looking at closely because it was communist?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Kerala was famous as the first governmental unit to vote in a Communist
                    government a free election. It had much more to do with the case and communal
                    character of the province than it had to do with Communism. Kerala was a
                    particular concern. We had a library at Trivandrum. USIS had a library there,
                    that was part of the Madras consular district. It was a place that did get a lot
                    of attention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we see, were we concerned about a communist,
                        increasing communist influence in India, or did we see it sort of as almost
                        a self-sealed political system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: The latter, I think. For one thing, the Communist Party was split in two
                    between the pro-Moscow and the pro-Chinese tendencies. And there certainly were
                    any number of leftists in the congress. I remember meeting V. K. Krishna. There
                    was a feeling that they would not prevail. For awhile, we got rather romantic
                    about this Swatantra party, which was a right-wing party, not right-wing in the
                    Hindu nationalist sense, but right-wing in terms of free enterprise. And they,
                    they actually did reasonably well in a couple of elections.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our impression at the time of the importance of
                        religion as a political influence?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>MCKEE: Oh, I laughed at this recent “Foreign Service Journal” piece where this
                    guy argues that we should have religious attach�s, religious affairs attach�s,
                    because I think we were acutely aware of the importance of religion. For one
                    thing, we knew very well that Gandhi had very deftly manipulated religious
                    symbols in order to mobilize the Hindu masses against the British. The spinning
                    wheel, the technique of self-sacrifice and all of that. And then of course we
                    were quite aware of Hindu-Muslim tensions. Not in Kashmir at that time, but very
                    much in other parts of the country. I remember once I had to go down to the
                    front office. I enjoyed sitting down with Patrick Moynihan and explaining that
                    in Uttar Pradesh only maybe fifteen percent of the people were Muslims, but then
                    they're split between these two major groups. I was going on and on, getting
                    mired very much in the details. But one of the great things about Moynihan,
                    because of his own love for local politics in New York and Boston and elsewhere
                    was that, he was quite willing to get down to the complexities in politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Kashmir, was that playing much of a role when
                        you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well it certainly was a bone of contention between the two countries, it
                    was an area that first Harmon Kirby and then Grant Smith reported on, because it
                    was a sort of a function of the Indian-Pakistani relationship. We kept an eye on
                    politics in Kashmir. There wasn't much violence, if any, at that time. For us
                    Embassy staffers it was a great place to go on holiday. The Ambassador could not
                    go, as I recall. The State Department held that if he were to go it would be
                    seen as showing that we endorsed the Indian claim, which we didn't. We didn't
                    endorse anybody's claim.</p>

                <p>MCKEE: And did so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess India and Pakistan were so involved in East

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: I guess, yes, certainly it was called a cease-fire line, there was a U.N.
                    presence in Kashmir from '47 onward, and even though the '65 war had been
                    essentially over Kashmir, in the early '70s it was Bengal that was the focus of
                    tensions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any thought, or anybody talking about India
                        maybe taking over east Bengal? I mean, East Pakistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>MCKEE: Certainly there was, I think the Pakistanis played on that fear. We were
                    always sort of skeptical in the Embassy, because essentially it would have meant
                    adding forty or fifty million Muslim voters. What would be the point? Bengal was
                    already a difficult problem; a united Bengal would be an even more difficult
                    problem. And there was so much bad blood between the Hindu Bengalis who had left
                    and the Muslims there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is talk, but my analysis, it probably wasn't going to
                        happen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: It probably was not gonna happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find, when you were a political officer,
                        getting around and talking to local politicians and all this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Very easy. As I talk to young Foreign Service Officers setting out at the
                    receptions that we give our A-100 classes, one of the few things I lament, but
                    one of the things I do lament, is that it was so much more difficult everywhere
                    to have that kind of fairly free and easy exchange with host country nationals,
                    which was very much the rule thirty years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Part of it's travel money...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Part of it is travel money, but most of it is security. And to some
                    extent, in particular parts of the world, the Muslim world for example, it is a
                    really sharp increase in anti-Americanism.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: That's right, the collapse was in '75.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the peace treaty, did that seem to, these accords, did

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well, I think so, but, really, realistically we were in the doghouse for
                    quite a long time after '71. And you remember the whole infrastructure was shot
                    away, the Peace Corps left, the agriculture university people left, the AID
                    mission became a shell of its former self, and by then our relations became very
                    thin indeed.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Nationalist sentiment very broadly. We had backed the wrong horse in 1971
                    and we should be made to pay for it. But Mrs. Gandhi had moved into her most
                    autocratic stage at that point. Let's see, I think, I can't remember now whether
                    her two-year emergency started or ended in '77, but she was moving towards this
                    period of essentially declaring herself Empress of India.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, well you left there in '74. Did you consider
                        yourself by that time a sub- continental hand or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Oh, one of my superiors wrote a very flattering efficiency report. He
                    called me “Mr. India.” And after five years I sort of did feel like Mr. India.
                    Although there were other people whose knowledge was much greater than mine.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well that was interesting. A lot of people said I should have gone back to
                    Washington, but I had a chance to go to Karachi, and so that's where I went, as
                    political officer. And all of a sudden I was in a much smaller fish pond. I
                    enjoyed the two years in Karachi, but I won't say they were years of tremendous
                    challenge. Throughout my career I avoided Washington. And others have said, and
                    it's I think probably true, my career would probably have been better for it. On
                    the other hand I didn't like working in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I think, too, I was in the service at the same time,
                        there are a great many of us who did everything we could to stay away from
                        Washington, and those that came back and got at a desk, Staff Assistants and
                        all probably did better. I mean this is what you do, but the fun was abroad,
                        at least at that time it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: It went back to 'Why did you join the Foreign Service? What was your
                    primary motivation?' And I don't think mine was ever really to make policy. Mine
                    was to learn foreign languages and to try to get into the knickers of foreign
                    society. That's a very fun thing.</p>

                <p>MCKEE: It was Islamabad, if you please. The first few buildings had gone up in
                    Islamabad, and so it was actually there. It wasn't, if memory serves, it wasn't
                    in Rawalpindi, and it wasn't up in the hills in Murree, it was in Islamabad.
                    That's certainly my memory.</p>

                <p>MCKEE: He was quite a figure. That was about the seventh or eighth dictatorship
                    to which he'd been Ambassador. And he was very good, he got along well with
                    Zulfikar Bhutto, and really, in a lot of ways, was a very impressive guy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Yes. He was still very much in charge. He had once been seen as almost the
                    hope of Asia, and with more than a bit of a leftist following. He was moving
                    steadily right, embracing the feudal interests and the commercial interests, and
                    becoming increasingly oppressive. He set up a force, called, I think, the FSF,
                    the Federal Security Force, which was essentially a bunch of thugs that beat up
                    people that Bhutto didn't like. And he was losing support among the Islamists,
                    not ever having had tremendous support among them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well was there, did you sense when you got to Pakistan
                        that there was a real problem of a country that had lost a significant part
                        of its territory and population and had been beaten in the war, you know,
                        resentment and all that built up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well myself, I always said, well what is the raison d'etre for Pakistan
                    now? There are now more Muslims in India or in Bangladesh than there are in
                    Pakistan, so in what sense is Pakistan a sort of home for the Muslims of the
                    subcontinent? But I must say the Pakistanis didn't seem to see it that way.
                    There were a number of rationalizations. One was that East Pakistan had been a
                    huge economic burden on the West Pakistan, which I think is an arguable point.
                    An awful lot of Pakistani exports came out of East Pakistan, jute particularly.
                    There were also the argument that they were lousy Muslims anyway. So there's a
                    certain amount of sour grapism going on, and there was certainly enough
                    anti-Indian animus to keep the country going.</p>

                <p>MCKEE: Good on the surface, good English, seemingly competent, District
                    Commissioners in rural areas, as in India, still had tremendous powers. But even
                    at that point the corruption which would later become endemic was certainly
                    gaining strength. I think it was because public sector salaries lagged so far
                    behind the private sector. One of the interesting things about India and
                    Pakistan was that they were two countries that did control the value of the
                    rupee. These were not countries in the '60s and '70s and '80s anyway which had
                    had the kind of rampant inflation that you had in a lot of other places. But
                    still, corruption was an increasing problem in Pakistan.</p>

                        yes. One of the great distinctions between East and the West, very, very
                        broadly, brutally broadly, is that in the West you pay bureaucrats bribes to
                        do things that are against the law, while in the East, you pay bureaucrats
                        just to do the job that they're supposed to be doing, which is rather
                        different. Once in my second tour in Pakistan, much later, I had a friendly
                        talk with a young Pakistani civil servant who was way out in the boonies.
                        His family was living with his mother, that is her mother in law, in Lahore.
                        He said that the only real question was in what areas were you going to be
                        corrupt, and to the extent, and in what areas that you were going to hold
                        the line. There was no question that you could live on your salary.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Negatively. In those days, the majority, this is true today, in Karachi,
                    were Muhajir's people whose parents, grandparents had come from India. They are
                    only native Urdu speakers in Pakistan, the only native speakers of the national
                    language. They live in Karachi, and also in Hyderabad, Sindh, which was the
                    second city of Sindh province. Bhutto was seen very much as a Sindhi landlord.
                    The Urdu speakers voted for Jamaat-i-Islami or one of the other religious
                    parties. This was before the Muhajir Quami Mahaz, Mohajapalmi Mahaz, came into
                    being. They did not vote for Bhutto and they did not like Bhutto.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Certainly the Bhutto people treated them pretty much with contempt. They
                    were not seen as an important element at that time. In '76, '77, as Bhutto moved
                    to court the Gulf money, the Gulf Arab states, by building gambling houses and
                    what have you, their negative power increased. They never had, and to this day
                    the religious parties have never received, more than five or ten percent of the
                    vote, and all of that in the cities. But what they have is the power to bring
                    down governments by mounting street demonstrations in the cities their negative
                    power grew as Bhutto became both more oppressive and increasingly was seen as
                    selling out the country to these Arab sheikhs.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Hmm. Good question. From the Karachi perspective, the answer depended on
                    whom you talked to. If you talked to a People's Party man, fine; if you talked
                    to an opposition person, obviously the feeling was that we should be more
                    even-handed. There was also a fascinating little tribal insurgency in
                    Baluchistan, precisely in that '74 to '76 period. Bhutto tried, initially, to
                    bring civilization to Baluchistan, which meant there would be some clinics and
                    schools. Some of the tribal chiefs realized that this was a very bad idea from
                    their perspective. They teamed up with the Daud Khan, who was in power in Kabul.
                    He had laid claim to this greater Pashtunistan, which basically was about a
                    third of Pakistan including all of Baluchistan. There were ongoing skirmishes in
                    the hills in Baluchistan, and one Pakistani general who had earlier been known
                    as the Butcher of Bangladesh became known as the Butcher of Baluchistan. His
                    name escapes me now. He was Governor of Punjab at one point in Pakistan.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find from Karachi that there was a much more... It
                        was a port and traditionally had been one of the major entrees into the
                        Middle East. Was there sort of a different attitude of openness towards the
                        world? Was it different than you had seen in New Delhi and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well I think so. Very sharp contrasts, in fact. Feeling of
                    self-sufficiency in India, feeling of ours is one of the three or four great
                    civilizations. As Mrs. Gandhi said more than once, other countries have no
                    lessons to teach us. Karachi was in those days, uniquely in Pakistan as well, a
                    very cosmopolitan area. The majority was Muhaji, as I said, lower class, what
                    have you, but the upper class Muhajirs were socially very much on the scene. And
                    then you had Bohras and other commercially-minded Muslim groups, there were
                    several very, very sophisticated Parsi families, and there was a sufficient
                    number of Catholics. Our local Archbishop was also a Cardinal. So there was
                    certainly a level of sophistication and knowledge of the outside world, which
                    wasn't there in much of the rest of Pakistan or in most of India.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Oh, very easy. Really, very easy. This was still, remember, within a
                    generation of the British having been there. Women were quite willing to appear
                    in public unveiled. I was quite struck in fact that the Sindh Club continued to
                    serve lunch throughout Ramadan, which they would not do now, and haven't done
                    for many years. In those days, no one seemed to find anything at all odd about
                    that. There was a great deal of reverence for Jinnah, in part because he was the
                    father of the country, but in part because he was seen as a man who, while a
                    devout Muslim, did not allow its precepts to control his life. He was never seen
                    as somebody who was trying to force Islam down anybody else's throat.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: You have to remember always that the military is overwhelmingly Punjabi. I
                    found at the time there were almost, there were essentially no Baluch and no
                    Sindhis in the Pakistan Army and very, very few Muhajirs. Musharraf, who's in
                    power now, is of course a Muhajir, but quite the exception that proves the rule.
                    So in Karachi basically no contact with the military.</p>

                <p>MCKEE: Gordon Tiger, bless his heart, when he came to DACOR Bacon House for the
                    Spring Reception mentioned that I had done a very impressive piece of analytical
                    reporting when I was there. Ah, but that was on the educational system. The
                    report I thought he was going to talk about was a piece I did on migration of
                    labor, because '74 to '76 was the period when the really big oil money began to
                    flow into the Gulf - Dubai and Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, what have you. And all
                    of a sudden it was hard to find a good air-conditioning repairman, it was harder
                    to find a good auto mechanic, hard to find a lot of skilled laborers you sort of
                    depended on. They had gone to the Gulf. So I went to the State Labor Office and
                    talked to them, and I talked to some labor contractors and whatever, and I put
                    together a piece of which I'm still rather proud. There was both the economics
                    and the sociology of it. I calculated that certainly at least one Pakistani in
                    ten was directly dependent on remittances from a relative in the Gulf for
                    sustaining daily life. I tried to get into some of the sociology of the
                    migration phenomenon, because, especially the skilled laborers, then were
                    essentially lower-middle class people - in any society, often socially, the most
                    conservative. And yet here the breadwinner, the male breadwinner was gone. And
                    so the woman, the head of the household, but one who traditionally never
                    ventured beyond that household, suddenly had to do so - not only go to the
                    market and buy the food, but also to put the kids in school, and she had just
                    all kinds of contact with the outside world that hadn't been there before. And
                    yet when the husband came back he wanted everything to be as it had been before.
                    There were an awful lot of social strains involved in this. So anyway I was
                    proud of it, part of my portfolio in Karachi in addition to the provincial
                    politics in the southern half of Pakistan was that I was a labor reporting
                    officer for all of Pakistan. So I got to fool around with that stuff.</p>
                <p>

                        system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well I did. The piece that Gordon so gently, kindly remembered after all
                    these years was a piece I did about education. Essentially I wrote that the
                    nationalization oeducation which had taken place under Bhutto had had the effect
                    of destroying the private schools - the only halfway decent schools in Pakistan
                    anyway, and so everything was going to hell in a bucket. It seemed to me that
                    religious schools were taking up the slack left by the failure of the public
                    schools. Gordon very kindly called that an impressive report.</p>

                <p>MCKEE: Ship breaking was an important industry. And it was done by people with
                    their bare hands. There was a beach outside of Karachi, technically in fact in
                    Baluchistan, where these old ships would be pulled up and then people would
                    swarm aboard them and take them apart. Certainly there were a lot of poor people
                    in Karachi. Karachi was a tremendous magnet. For example, the docks were almost
                    controlled by people from the Northwest Frontier Province. They pushed, they
                    pushed the others out. Politics was intensely ethnic and linguistic, as well as
                    religious.</p>

                    inter- war period, 1920-1940, Karachi had been relatively prosperous, and so you
                    had lots of Persian carpets there, made by Persians who at that point were poor.
                    By the mid-'70s Persians had become rich. Persians came back to Karachi to buy
                    back semi-antique carpets which had in fact originated in Persia. One saw them
                    around.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As far as being Muslim, how about the Sunni-Shia split?
                        How did this play out in Pakistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well, it played out, but not so much in Karachi. Nobody knows how many
                    Shia there are, it's somewhere between fifteen and twenty-five percent of
                    Pakistan's population. There certainly were sectarian disturbances in Karachi.
                    There were Shia neighborhoods and also, up the river, a place called Khairpur.
                    Khairpur was one of the few princely states to survive in British Sindh, and its
                    nawab had been a Shia Muslim, so it was a sort of a focal point for Shias.
                    Sectarian tensions came to the fore always during Moharram. There's a point at
                    which the Shia, to mourn the death of Imam Hussein at Karbala, take these
                    tazias, these huge papier mache mockups of Hussein's tomb at Karbala, in Iraq,
                    and march them through the streets. Now as they marched them through the
                    streets, they did two things really. One of them is that they flagellate
                    themselves, “ya Hussein, ya Hassan, ya Ali, ya Hussein, ya Hassan, ya Ali,” and
                    they put knives through their cheeks and bleed all over the place. They also
                    curse the first four Caliphs, the Sunni Caliphs, Omar and Abu Bakr and the other
                    two. And this of course for Sunni Muslims is just intolerable, so the Pakistani
                    authorities had to put a policeman practically every two feet apart all the way
                    of the march from the Imam Bara to, down to the river, where these things were
                    then dunked into the river, seen no more. But always, certainly everyone feared
                    great sectarian outbursts on occasion.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Peace Corps and AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Gone, gone, gone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They'd gone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Bhutto threw out the Peace Corps. He had thrown the Peace Corps out much
                    earlier in fact, I think when he was Foreign Minister under Ayub Khan. And AID
                    mission, the extent of it, it was up in Islamabad, almost nothing in
                    Karachi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was Bhutto taking that stand, as we saw it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: He threw out the Peace Corps when he was Foreign Minister. He was trying
                    to build up his leftist image to draw distinction between him and Ayub Khan.
                    Ayub was seen as very much on the right and close to the Americans, so the only
                    place that Bhutto could go really to build up popular support and build up an
                    image was to go to the left, and pose as the champion of the poor. It wasn't
                    called the Pakistan People's Party for nothing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it Bhutto was seen by your and your colleagues at
                        the consulate maybe up in Islamabad as being an opportunistic leader as
                        opposed to one of very strong beliefs.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>MCKEE: I think that's fair. Certainly what I reported from Karachi was what I saw
                    as this steady shift from the left to the right by Prime Minister Bhutto. You
                    know it's hard to conceive now, but when he first came to power his was a really
                    pretty good intellect. He was educated in London, educated at the University of
                    Southern California. A guy who had somehow seen a way to bring out the poor
                    masses. He wanted things like barefoot doctors who basically knew only about
                    three or four things, but those were the three or four diseases from which
                    eighty percent of the people suffered. There was a guy named Kamal Asfar who
                    wrote a whole book, it's basically sort of a Communist Chinese inspiration for
                    providing health care and education to the poor of Pakistan. One of his great
                    ideas was to liberate women from the drudgery of making chapattis every day. Men
                    demanded that the chapattis be made hot and on the spot and all, very labor
                    intensive. So he set up these chapatti bakeries that were gonna turn out this
                    pukka pakai roti, which was, you know, already made-up bread. It was a big
                    failure, but the thinking behind it was interesting. Over time, I don't know,
                    it's funny, the occasional conversation that really sticks with you. I got to
                    know a bookseller in the bazaar in Karachi. I got him to the house one time, he
                    drank only tea, and was very nervous. He had been a very strong supporter of
                    Bhutto in the beginning, in the '60s under Ayub and then later, and was very
                    much on the left, and therefore was very nervous about being in this big house
                    with this American diplomat. He said to me, 'My friend, we have all been frozen
                    out now. We once had a role to play in the party and it's gone.' The one or two
                    politicians who had been close to Bhutto in his early leftist phase were beaten
                    up, physically. Pakistan in many ways is not a subtle country at all. I mean
                    they were physically beaten by these Federal Security Force people. And I knew
                    one of the ones that had been beaten. You know these conversations leave an
                    impact on you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh God, yes. Well, how about relations between our
                        consulate general in Karachi and the Embassy in Islamabad. Sometimes these
                        are not the greatest, and other times they are.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well, it was a very useful experience to be the political officer in
                    Karachi, because the political counselor in Islamabad was Howie Schaffer, whom I
                    had known already for some years. And my consul general thought that I was his
                    political officer, and Howie Schaffer thought that I was his political officer.
                    I remember once Howie came down, and we took the long drive up through the Bolan
                    Pass, two day trip to Quetta, to do some provincial reporting. I took advantage
                    of that long time in the carry-all to try to point out to Howie, you know,
                    “Look, Howie, I'm here to report on whatever you want reported on or analyze
                    whatever you want analyzed, but you really need to get on the horn with my boss
                    and chat him up, and construct it in such a way that he agrees that it would be
                    a good idea if Richard were to focus on X for awhile. If you call me up and tell
                    me to do something, you put me immediately in a bind.” Howie took the advice
                    very well. I remember we're sitting at one point beside a canal in Quetta and
                    chatting. He did that, and things worked fine thereafter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you left there in what, '76?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>MCKEE: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: I went out to Washington. I put in a year, a fairly unhappy year, I'm just
                    not a good bureaucrat - as a Desk Officer, Senior Desk Officer for Pakistan. I
                    was also working with a wacky guy that didn't make life any better. My Officer
                    Director was a bit of a nutcase.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: State.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Yes, State. And NEA PAB, and I was really not happy. I had always wanted
                    to study Arabic, and when the chance came to do it I leaped at it. I got out of
                    there after a year and did a year's worth of Arabic in Washington and then a
                    year's worth in Tunisia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time you were in the Desk, did you feel that
                        you just weren't a Desk Officer type, or was it the personnel, the people,
                        or issues or something that made you uncomfortable?MCKEE: One of the
                        problems was simply information retrieval. When you're a desk officer, you
                        don't ask the questions, you're the one who has to answer them. You get
                        these requests for various kinds of information. The office wasn't very well
                        organized. So information retrieval, in a pre-computer age, was often quite
                        time consuming and quite frustrating. Anyway, I certainly knew I was looking
                        for a way out. In a funny way, as had been the case earlier in getting out
                        of Latin America, studying a hard language was the way out.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the year you were on the Pakistan desk, did you
                        catch tension between the Indian desk? Was that going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: U. S. relations with both countries were pretty low, so the really sharp
                    divisions that had been there earlier I think were a lot less sharp. Now what
                    was fascinating was that Bhutto was going down the tubes during that year, and
                    the question was really, what would we do about it? How would we handle
                    that?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we, did we feel particularly committed towards
                        Bhutto?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: I think not. He was more or less democratically elected, that was
                    obviously a plus. Our relations with India were very bad. That was during the
                    period of Indira's emergency, so the Indians couldn't play their trump card as
                    the world's largest democracy. But I don't think we felt any tremendous
                    commitment to Bhutto, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Benazir and his daughter at all a figure at that time?
                        Did you ever meet her?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: I met her first at Simla, in 1972, when Bhutto took her along for the
                    negotiations with Mrs. Gandhi that resolved the issues remaining from the 1971
                    war. But she had not yet emerged into her own, into the limelight at that
                    point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did, while you were on the desk, were there any within
                        congress or other places, partisans of one side of the Indian or the

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Yes, yes, I don't remember the details now. A few Democrats liked
                    Pakistan, certainly Steve Solarz was a great fan of I think both Bhutto, and
                    later certainly Benazir. Republicans tended to see Pakistan in a more favorable
                    light, because it was anti-communist and anti-Soviet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, India was trying to get a hold of us, wasn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Sure, sure. It was a big economy, but yet not a great big market for U.S.
                    trade or investment, and the rhetoric into the late '70s was still essentially
                    state socialism, not free market.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well also too there seems to be a perennial problem that
                        Americans and Indians tend to preach at each other.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Absolutely.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: But one of the reasons I do think that the Pakistanis were popular was
                    that they didn't preach at Americans. In fact, indeed they often could play the
                    role of courtier very effectively. There's this marvelous story of Nixon, when
                    he was out of power, flying around the world. In India nobody came to the
                    airport to greet him, and it was just crap. His plane landed in Lahore. Field
                    Marshall Ayub Khan was there at the end of the red carpet, and put him up in
                    exactly the same house that he put him up when he had been vice president some
                    years earlier. These things have a psychological and political impact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. Well, there's Henry Kissinger. You hear these
                        stories about how Henry Kissinger would land in New Delhi on one of his
                        round-the-world flights or something, and he and Indira Gandhi would sort
                        of... They wouldn't even talk to each other. They'd just sort of sit there
                        for awhile. It was sort of like going for a root canal treatment or
                        something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well, there's a new, and it seems to me a very good biography called
                    “Indira,” by a woman named Katherine Frank. I'm just maybe a hundred-fifty pages
                    into it, but she's clearly done her homework, and she brings up, in the parts
                    I've read so far, what a very difficult and distracted and interrupted childhood
                    Indira had. She has already hinted at Indira's use of silence to intimidate
                    people - she simply wouldn't respond. And certainly for journalists who
                    interviewed Indira, it drove them nuts. She wouldn't open up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting how these things can have quite an
                        impact. Well in Arabic, was anybody saying 'hey, we invested in your Urdu
                        and all and your Hindi' or was that considered already paid off?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Hey, come on! Seven years in the Subcontinent. I had paid my debt to

                <p>MCKEE: '77 to '78 at FSI, and then '78 to '79 in Tunis.</p>

                    with the script, but it's an extremely difficult language. There's a piece in

                <p>MCKEE: And you know, cognates are almost nil. In the written script, long vowels
                    are indicated but short vowels are not. You basically have to know what they are
                    before you read the piece. And some of the sounds are quite different. It's a

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Pretty much, because the FSI school had been moved from Beirut when, in
                    '73 or something like that? So yes, we were in the old Italian cultural center
                    downtown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is Tunisia a good place to do this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Among Arabists there was this huge argument about the relocation of the
                    school. Ambassador Herman Eilts did not want the school in Cairo, because our
                    relations with Egypt were just getting re-established, and the Egyptians' big
                    complaint against the Russians in Cairo had been that there had been too damn
                    many of them. He was aware of that. There were also all kinds of questions as to
                    what is the best accent. A lot of people think that the East Bank Palestinian is
                    one of the clearest and best, but anyway, yes, there was an argument. Certainly
                    what we learned in Tunis was not Tunisian Arabic. It was what I called radio
                    Arabic or semi-classical Arabic, it was a sort of a denatured generic kind of
                    Arabic. The native Tunisian Arabic is pretty hard to understand. And in fact at

                <p>MCKEE: Ah, I didn't know, or didn't take a trip. Now why didn't I take a trip?
                    Maybe, I think family concerns and money concerns. You're right, there was a
                    trip that one could have taken, but I remember very distinctly that I did not
                    take a trip.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: I don't know, counting military guys and whatever I suppose it must have
                    been about twenty or something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feeling, was there sort of an attitude

                <p>MCKEE: From the Tunisians?Q: No, from within the group that was going, taking
                    Arabic.</p>
                <p>MCKEE: That's a tough question. I'm not in “The Arabists,” that famous book. I
                    think, almost willy-nilly, when you make the emotional investment and the
                    temporal investment involved in studying a hard language, you develop some
                    sympathy with the people for whom it's their native language. Yes, I think even
                    then there was a feeling that somehow the Israelis exercised undue influence
                    over United States policy to the detriment of good relations with the Arab
                    states.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder how they could have that impression. I'm
                        laughing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: I'm gonna review this book by Bernard Lewis, I've gotta buckle down and do
                    it. “What Went Wrong,” which is a brilliant treatise on exactly that. The
                    subtitle is “Western Impact and Middle East Response.” He didn't get into Israel
                    until the conclusion. He really is a very comprehensive historian. I strongly
                    think that, fighting terrorism is a very important thing to do. But you also
                    have to look at the root causes, and the fact of the matter is very few people
                    are willing to do that. Doing so leads directly to questioning the policies that
                    we have followed. Not that Clinton was much better in foreign policy, but,
                    President Bush has just, may have taken a huge step towards destroying the
                    international trade system by agreeing to huge tariffs on steel, just to pick up
                    a couple of electoral votes in Ohio and West Virginia and Pennsylvania. And you
                    know, Bush's indulgence of Israel is in no-one's long-term interests, this is
                    not in the long term interests of the United States, not in the long term
                    interests of the peace of the region, and it is not in the long-term interests
                    of Israel.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think one of the most disturbing things is how, if the
                        United States is trying to play a role in the Middle East, it should try to
                        play a positive role rather than one which is tied to American electoral
                        votes, which is how it is today. And it has been that way for a long, long
                        time.MCKEE: This is also true of our policy toward Cuba. Whatever vestiges
                        of impartiality remain, we already lost our standing as some kind of a
                        mediator between the Arabs and the Israelis. The Arab do not see us as
                        coming into the court with anything like clean hands. There are certainly
                        some very ugly anti-Semites crawling out from under the rock now, seeing
                        their opportunity, but I really believe that the course on which Israel has
                        embarked will lead to the destruction of Israel.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I feel that the associated Jewish influence on American
                        body politics regarding Israel in the long run will help destroy Israel,
                        because it's given this feeling of immunity, and so it can almost disregard
                        the rest of the world because the United States has supposed, and it's a
                        road to disaster.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: It is, it's a road to nowhere. Tony Judt wrote a very good piece in the
                    “New York review of books” about a month ago. He called it “the Road to
                    Nowhere.” And he started out by focusing on Raymond Aron and the question of
                    Algeria in the early '60s. Aron said, “Look, we cannot kill all the Algerians,
                    and so we have to leave.” And that's really what faces the Israelis on the West
                    Bank and in Gaza. I mean, how long will it be before the Israeli Arabs, who are
                    what, twenty percent of the population? How long before they, themselves, start
                    engaging in suicide tactics? Anyway, so yes, to answer your question, there
                    certainly was some, I think, deep concern about Israel's course. That would be
                    the nice way to put it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well also at that time it was more or less the career
                        pattern that you were not going to serve in Israel. Was that sort of,</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Yes, yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It made a difference rather than, as we try today to mix
                        it up more.</hi>

                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>MCKEE: Well, one of the students, and a close friend of mine to this day is Ed
                    Abington. He had served in Israel, and then was taking Arabic. There were
                    others, Ed Djerejian, for example, who were trying to see both sides of the
                    equation and try to work it through. Dick Murphy of course was the avatar of
                    this kind of sentiment. The elitist Arabist was going out of favor at that time.
                    There's also one other thing - the fact that Arabic is not only a very difficult
                    language but the fact is that the quality of intellectual discourse in the Arab
                    world is wretched. The great line about learning Arabic is that it's the golden
                    key that unlocks the door to an empty room. And there's a lot of truth to that.
                    I can understand the extreme irritation and frustration - I can't really - but I
                    at least empathize with it. Not only these Palestinian kids who have known
                    nothing but refugee their whole lives, their parents have, but also middle-class
                    Arabs. They look around, and they look at these Arab governments, middle-class
                    Arabs look around and say 'My God! How did we get stuck with this?' And to some
                    extent of course they say well, “it's because the Americans support this
                    wretched king who's oppressing us.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well also, a part of the people who are going, a third
                        generation taking Arabic, it was considered a good career move to learn a
                        hard language, but it meant that you had a whole series of capitals in which
                        you would serve.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Yes, I thought it was very much so. Why the hell take Burmese for Christ's
                    sake, Bulgarian, where would you go with that? Arabic is spoken in twenty-odd
                    capitals. In NEA as State, South Asia had always been sort of this funny kind of
                    suburb which eventually, you know got municipal status on its own. If you were
                    going to stay in NEA, you really had to have Arabic, or you weren't really fully
                    a member of the club. I think that was quite clear.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I think, you know, something that I'm not sure has
                        picked up by some people looking at this that, to be an Arabist, essentially
                        careerist, I mean this was a good career move, early Arabists were the sons
                        of missionaries who had served in Syria or some other place like that, but I
                        mean there were sort of hard-headed people said 'Hell, I want to go here,
                        not because they want the Arabs and hated the Jews or anything like that, it
                        was just, as you say, you learn the hard language, you become a member of an
                        organization which has got twenty places, and also, it was a sort of chance
                        to be an Ambassador or a DCM.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: At least in Mauritania or some place like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or something like that as opposed to, you know, if you
                        learn French or German, NATO affairs, you're never going to be an
                        Ambassador, because those are political appointments.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well if you had French you could then end up as Ambassador to Ouagadougou
                    or Lome or something.</p>

                <p>MCKEE: Well after the year in Tunis I got in a beat-up old Mercedes that I owned
                    and I drove across Algeria for about a week. I went to Rabat where I then spent
                    two fairly unhappy years. I loved Morocco, but the embassy was an unhappy place.
                    I had a big fight with the counselor for administration. I really wanted to get
                    the hell out of there.</p>

                        there for a year as political officer. Then Ambassador Murphy sent me to

                    because money was tight and I realized it was probably impossible for me to get
                    promoted into the Senior Service with a political counselor / human rights

                <p>MCKEE: It's an interesting story, it's a good Foreign Service story. The then
                    Permanent Representative was a political guy, a friend of President Reagan's. He
                    thought, in true businessman fashion maybe, that he could run the place without
                    a DCM, a political counselor, or a human rights officer. He was prevailed upon
                    eventually to accept a DCM; he had fired the previous one, and to combine the
                    political counselor and human rights job into one. And I got that position. So I
                    supervised three people, one of whom did only WHO, a civil servant, one of whom
                    did only ILO, Foreign Service Officer, and one of whom did several things,
                    economic commission for Europe and IPU groups of that nature. And then I did the
                    human rights stuff myself. I also was the Mission liaison with the International
                    Committee of the Red Cross.Q: Well now, there are a number of organizations in
                    Geneva, what was the title of yours?</p>

                <p>MCKEE: Oh, it was a whole range of them, World Health Organization was there,
                    International Labor Organization, the International Telecommunications
                    Union.</p>

                <p>MCKEE: He was a used car or used tire dealer, I was never sure, from New
                    Hampshire. In the 1980 Republican primary, there was a famous scene in which
                    Ronald Reagan commandeered the microphone in a panel discussion with other
                    candidates for the Republican nomination, saying, 'I paid for that microphone'.

                <p>MCKEE: Well it's sort of a diverse mission, in the sense that most of the

                    But various groups wanted to politicize them, and State did not want to seem
                    them politicized, and so, in a way I suppose you could say I was the
                    anti-political counselor, I was the one who was trying to get them to focus on
                    what the U.S. Government thought was the business at hand and not an extraneous
                    agenda that involved political grievances and various human rights things.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well, I was very lucky, because Gerry Carmen quite about six weeks after I
                    got there, and his successor was a very nice guy, Joe Petrone, whose wife
                    Augusta was also a very nice person. Two very good DCMs, Ron Flack my first year
                    and Bill Marsh my second year, so the Mission itself ran fairly smoothly after
                    Gerry left. I've gotta confess, I was not particularly attracted to UN work,
                    it's heavily, heavily influenced by precedent, every resolution and every
                    meeting, practically every resolution builds on the preceding resolution. And
                    every adverb and every semi-colon is argued about. Also, the UN organizations
                    ran on the same regional basis on which the UN political side in New York ran -
                    the African group, the Western European and Others Group, in those days,
                    essentially the Soviet Group, the Latino group and all of that. This left Israel
                    out in the cold. More to the point, in that setting there were an awful lot of
                    awfully boring planning meetings of the group before you sat in on a very boring
                    plenary of ITU or ILO or whatever it was.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well it was sort of, the same battles fought again and
                        again and again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Absolutely, absolutely. The same resolutions would be brought up year
                    after year and debated year after year, and slightly modified to reflect
                    changing political alliances and conditions, and then voted on. It was, frankly,
                    very hard to see the relevance of all of it. Now having said that, I did enjoy
                    the Human Rights Commission and the Human Rights Committee, which is an experts
                    group. I did come to see that they couldn't function without the NGOs. NGOs are
                    very important in the international human rights arena, as they are for example
                    in the international environmental arena.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly when the Reagan administration came in, it
                        was, if it didn't run on an anti-UN platform, it certainly, the United
                        Nations was not its favorite organization. Was this reflected in what you
                        all were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>MCKEE: Well, I think so, I think so. And that's actually one of the reasons I
                    curtailed, because I just couldn't see that the Reagan administration had any
                    real use for the UN. The great example of it is, for my money, the appointment
                    of Armando Valadares as our representative to the UN Human Rights Commission in
                    1988. He was Cuban, who after twenty-odd years in Castro's jails was freed and
                    went to live in Spain. He was a bit of a hero for right-wing Cubans in Florida
                    and elsewhere. He came out in '87 as an advisor to the U. S. delegation. Then,
                    as I think is often the case, he was named to lead it. The fact is that he got
                    his citizenship through some special legislation, only weeks, or at the most,
                    months before the Commission convened in the spring of 1988. He spoke rapid-fire
                    Cuban Spanish, and actually pretty good French, but almost no English. The point
                    here was that the only use that the Reagan administration had for the UN system
                    was to try to politicize it, and make it serve these objectives. In this case,
                    the goal was to get a human rights resolution targeting Cuba, which we did.
                    That's the reason I have that Superior Honor Award on the wall. The Reagan
                    administration was not interested in the programmatic aspects of the Human
                    Rights Commission, the special rapporteurs on torture, on non-judicial killing,
                    that kind of thing. And they were not interested very much in the ILO, for
                    example. So it was in a lot of ways not a very happy environment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how did you find dealing with your counterparts on
                        these various commissions? Were they more or less creatures in the UN, had
                        they acclimated themselves or it, or did you find otherwise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well I think in the Western European and Others Group, there were
                    thoughtful people with a lot of experience in multilateral diplomacy who did
                    really feel that the organization had something to contribute to making the
                    world better. I would argue that their situation was a little bit easier, in
                    that they almost all represented parliamentary democracies, whereas of course in
                    our system, you have to keep track of what the Executive wants, you have to keep
                    an eye on what Congress wants, and it's a much more diffuse kind of government.
                    The representatives of the other countries in most cases were either political
                    appointees or sort of careerists run rampant, not a very inspiring crowd.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you mentioned you got a Superior Honor Award, what
                        did you do to sort of merit this?</hi>

                <p>MCKEE: Mollify the members of the Western European and Others Group by, first of
                    all, persuading the Department and then Mr. Valadares to come two weeks earlier,
                    earlier than usually had been the case. I took him around to call on heads of
                    missions there, key missions there, so that they could see that he wasn't a
                    Johnny one-note. He actually was, and this was true, he was also interested in
                    other human rights issues such as Chile and South Africa, which were hot at that
                    time. But also just basically I made an effort to develop a rapport between him
                    and these other missions so that we could achieve our objective, which was this
                    resolution about Cuba. To that end, I mean the White House moved mountains,
                    President Reagan would call presidents of other countries to get them to vote in
                    favor of our resolution, or at least to abstain.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Soviets play any particular role in what you were
                        seeing there at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: They were not active in retrospect in the human rights commission or in
                    the ILO or the other organizations, WHO, ITU. The country was actually beginning
                    to fall apart a little bit. The most significant, I think, conversation I ever
                    had in the Foreign Service was that my Russian opposite number. One of my duties
                    was also to keep an eye on regional political issues. For example, while I was
                    there, there were proximity talks between the Afghanistan resistance and the
                    Soviets about the Soviets' leaving Afghanistan. And Cambodia was another
                    regional issue, I got to know, my Soviet opposite number a bit. He called me
                    once and asked me to come by for coffee in the Delegates' Lounge. It turned out
                    that he was really quite distraught. He had come from a family of old
                    Bolsheviks. His father had been a railroad engineer, what more Stalinoid
                    occupation could there have been? He was brought up believing all this stuff. Of
                    course the revelations of the '50s had some adverse impact. But what really hit
                    him was his brother is coming back from serving the military in Afghanistan as a
                    drug addict. He was just really concerned that the Soviet Union was falling
                    apart. He made the point that, what are now the Turkic Republics in Central
                    Asia, were all run by these family rival mafias that the USSR authorities were
                    afraid to confront. But anyway, overall the answer to your question, I don't
                    remember the Soviets being particularly active in these fora.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Oh, absolutely, this was one of the biggest thing that the political
                    counselor did. A whole bunch of pro-Arab resolutions would be introduced into
                    every forum, including when the ICRC had one of its once-every-five-year
                    meetings.</p>

                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>MCKEE: Yes, the Red Cross, yes. While I was there, in every forum the Arab group
                    would introduce resolutions. If it was in the ILO, it would be the Israeli
                    suppression of Palestinian trade unions; in the WHO, it would be Israeli health
                    practices that threaten the health of Palestinian children. And, mind you, there
                    was a lot of sentiment among the representatives of the developing countries and
                    also among the Europeans that this was true, that the Israelis did deserve to be
                    censured and criticized. Of course this was not the view in Washington.</p>

                <p>MCKEE: Well, that's not too far from the mark, although, we're not talking rocket
                    science. These resolutions are published and you know who's sponsoring them and
                    you know what they say.</p>

                    the Israelis' contempt for the UN matches the UN's contempt for Israel.</p>

                <p>MCKEE: Well it's very different from bilateral diplomacy. It combines the worse
                    aspects of a grade school classroom and an insane asylum. Others find it
                    challenging and rewarding, but I didn't. So an opportunity came up to go back to
                    Pakistan, to the Consulate General in Lahore, and so I put in for it. Thanks to
                    a couple patrons, Arnie Raphel, may he rest in peace, and Ed Abington,
                    particularly, Bob Peck, may he rest in peace. I was assigned as Consul General
                    in Lahore in 1988.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Three years, '88 to '91.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Pakistan and then Lahore in
                        '88?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well, first of all, we kept the Consulate in Lahore open primarily because
                    it's really the political capital of the country. The legal capital is Islamabad
                    and the economic capital is Karachi. The real political capital is Lahore,
                    because the Punjab, of which Lahore is the capital, is the biggest province,
                    about fifty percent of the people and about eighty percent of the army
                    personnel. We also did visas of course, and “visa” is a four- letter word.
                    Anyone who's dealt with them for any length of time knows what a frustrating,
                    irritating factor, visas can be. The situation in the country politically and
                    internationally, was that our relations were not really very good, the Pressler
                    Amendment had come in, and there wasn't much aid to Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Because of the Pakistanis' efforts to achieve a nuclear weapons
                    capability, the aid was cut off. So relations really weren't good. There was
                    sort of an effort to keep military aid going for awhile. The Congress got wise
                    and cut that off, too. Pakistan is a country with a permanent sense of grievance
                    and vulnerability. While China was more important to them than we were, we were
                    always pretty important to them as well. And a lot of Pakistanis genuinely like
                    Americans. One of the differences between my tour in Karachi, in '74 to '76 and
                    my later tour in Lahore from '88 to '91 was that by the time of the second tour
                    there was this large group of Pakistani professionals living and working in the
                    States, particularly doctors and vets. That made a real difference in the
                    bilateral relationship. In the country, the situation was that Benazir Bhutto,
                    whom I could really never stand, was Prime Minister. Her major opponent, Mian
                    Nawaz Sharif, was a rascal, but a lovable rascal. He was the chief minister of
                    my province, of the Punjab, and so therefore I had to be very careful in my
                    dealings with the provincial government. If the federal government complained to
                    the Ambassador, and the Ambassador, was Bob Oakley, he would come down on
                    me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard Benazir Bhutto has had sort of this, sort of a
                        star boding in the American media and all that, but people who vote with
                        her, in the government at that time don't give her the same quality, what
                        were, how did you see her?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>MCKEE: A very complex person. She had two brothers, both dead now, but her father
                    chose her, not one of them, to inherit the political mantle. I saw that for the
                    first time that Simla in the hills of India in 1972, when Mrs. Gandhi and Bhutto
                    negotiated the end of the Bangladesh war. It was clear the Bhutto had brought
                    her along to take away some of the limelight from Indira, and she did so. At
                    that point she was twenty years old, very attractive undergraduate at Cambridge.
                    But I just thought that she was, this tremendous elitist, really quite arrogant
                    in a lot of ways, as were the people around her, whereas Nawaz Sharif came
                    essentially from a Kashmiri background from an industrialist family, and was
                    much rougher around the edges. In fact, I thought he was much more in touch with
                    the average Pakistani. That said, he was initially a creation of the
                    intelligence service and the military. He only later acquired political
                    popularity of his own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, where did the Punjab sit in the Pakistan
                        equation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: All the Punjab, except economically perhaps, even there, really dominated
                    the whole country. I mean it was fifty - sixty percent of the population, it was
                    eighty percent of the Army, its landowner class was the dominant political
                    class, the Punjabis really just dominated, they dominated the civil bureaucracy.
                    The only competition they had once had was from the Muhajirs, immigrants from
                    India who settled in Karachi. By the time of my second tour, the Muhajirs,
                    politically were isolated in their own political party and really did not,
                    didn't have much impact except nuisance value nationally. The only other
                    challenge to the Punjabis was probably from the Pathans in the Northwest
                    Frontier Province who were pretty well represented in the Army. The Sindhi
                    landlords, Mrs. Bhutto being one of them, of course were a political class to be
                    conjured with.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: It was not very prominent, but it became more prominent after the Iraqi
                    invasion of Kuwait. There had been several Islamic political parties, and I made
                    an effort to cultivate their leaders in Lahore. Their following was almost
                    entirely middle-class urban people. They had no following in the countryside
                    because the landlords didn't permit them to develop a following in the
                    countryside. So there were occasional flare-ups and there were riots against
                    Christians and there were occasional demonstrations between various sects of
                    Muslims about who was either a better Muslim or not a Muslim at all. But the
                    sentiment only crystallized after Saddam invaded Kuwait, and then there were
                    lots of demonstrations. Now the irony here was that Saddam had been, up until
                    that point, a secularist. He became a Muslim only after he invaded Kuwait.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how did you find, was Saddam a popular, he invaded
                        Kuwait, did this push him into greater popularity?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>MCKEE: The Iraqi Embassy spread a lot of money around into lots of pockets in
                    Saddam's favor. Posters put up on walls and things like that. I think among the
                    lower classes in Pakistan, there was resentment of the United States, and he was
                    able to play on that. One of my favorite people in Pakistan, who was later
                    assassinated, was a man of Kashmiri descent who was the Chief Minister of the
                    Punjab attermian. Nawaz Sharif moved to Islamabad as Prime Minister. He got up
                    and said 'Any Pakistani who endorses the idea that a larger country can invade
                    and occupy a smaller neighboring country should have his head examined.' He was
                    absolutely right, but that didn't count for much with the demonstrators.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did, how did you find working there, I mean what was
                        it, were you sort of under- siege or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: No, no. After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, we slowly had to send people
                    home, so soon we were just a little group of brothers and sisters there at the
                    Consulate. Dependants and all had to be sent home. So we watched lots of videos.
                    We watched the whole series of “The Lonesome Dove” on the VCR. I had a
                    bodyguard, but I never cut down my public appearances. February of '91, I went
                    to, an annual kite-flying festival which was a very big thing in Lahore. I went
                    to one celebration on the roof of one of these hotels. The media were there, and
                    I had a lot of fun. The next day the media made a lot of the fact that despite
                    the tensions between the United States and Iraq, and the threats to the
                    Americans here, here's the Consul General out flying a kite. I was participating
                    in a local, cultural... popular cultural festival.</p>

                <p>MCKEE: Whoo! Traveled all the time, sure, I love to travel, all over the boonies.
                    By car down to Multan, over to Faisalabad. We scheduled regular trips. You know,
                    the usual routine, you let the government know what you're doing, and you work
                    together on setting up appointments, and you go see the Governor and the Chief
                    Minister and the various Ministers, the local newspaper guy and whatever, and

                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>MCKEE: Yes, the answer then has to be yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well the reason I asked this is it became sort of a
                        fascination almost around the world about, granted it was through a vaguely
                        distorted lens, but it looked like a very high-tech war and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: One of the most successful things I ever did was sort of by chance. The
                    U.S. Defense Representative, Pakistan, would have been in charge of our military
                    supply and training mission if we had had one. He was up in Islamabad and wanted
                    to come down to Lahore. I thought that was a good idea because Lahore is rife
                    with retired generals, not so much active duty generals, but lots and lots of
                    very impressive, retired generals. So he came down, and I organized a lunch for
                    him. There must have been twenty-five retired colonels and generals there. As it
                    turned out it was on the day, or the day after, General Schwarzkopf's brilliant
                    maneuvers that cut off the Iraqi Army and all that. This American brigadier
                    demonstrated his cleverness by being fully prepared with his easel and his maps
                    and his pointers to show exactly what Schwarzkopf had done. I want to tell you,
                    these generals enjoyed the show. In the '65 war with India, there occurred just
                    outside of Lahore the largest scale tank battles between the Second World War
                    and the Israeli-Arab war of '67, so a lot of these guys had a lot of experience
                    with tank maneuvers, and they were just fascinated. It was a lovely luncheon.
                    People talked about it for months afterward.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you concerned about all of a sudden a mob appearing
                        to burn down the consulate as happened to our embassy in Islamabad?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Oh, yes, that was a concern. It was interesting. They always targeted the
                    USIS office, which was near the university and separate from the Consulate. It
                    was more accessible to the students and easier to get up a mob there. Of course
                    USIS didn't issue visas. They were a little, I thought it was probably a little
                    bit careful about attacking the Consulate because they might be recognized and
                    not get a visa. Also the area where the Consulate was located was more difficult
                    to access. There was one time I remember when things were very bad, and there
                    were demonstrators going after the Consulate. My servant suggested that I put on
                    the Pakistani national dress, the shalwar kameez, a very flowing, loose kind of
                    thing, and slip out the back door of my residence. And I said 'Look, with my
                    eyes and complexion that's not gonna happen.' So they did in fact run past the
                    house and nothing happened. Now mind you I had at that point maybe a half dozen
                    policemen outside the house, and I made sure that they got tea and cookies on a
                    regular basis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any trouble talking to various people in your
                        area?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>MCKEE: Not really. I even reached out to the bearded ones, and organized for
                    example one of these interactive television things. I had an excellent female
                    public affairs officer. The bearded ones could talk to Muslim savants in the
                    United States about how Muslims were treated in the United States and all that.
                    These old boys were deeply but narrowly educated, loved the attention and they
                    just sort of bloomed this program was during Ramadan, so I invited them all back
                    to the house, sat 'em down on carpets, must have been twenty or twenty-five of
                    them. When the cannon boomed and it was the end of the day's fast, the servants
                    came around with milk and dates, you always break the fast in Pakistan with milk
                    and dates. And then we had a really nice dinner, I thought that was a good thing
                    to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Bhutto government, I understand it was
                        quite corrupt, I guess most of them are, but her governments are known for
                        being pretty corrupt. Were we reporting on this or were you feeling
                        constraints in the Embassy saying 'let's not push this too hard.'?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: You know, the kind of contracts where corruption might be involved were at
                    the federal level in Islamabad. Sitting in Lahore, I didn't hear about things
                    like that. It was always secondhand, it wasn't really my area of responsibility.
                    One thing that I regret in retrospect is that, a little bit distracted by Mian
                    Nawaz Sharif's roguishness, I didn't report on the extent of his corruption. He
                    and his family were also knee-deep in corruption, as later came out when he was
                    Prime Minister, or after he was Prime Minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did, what sort of staff did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: A great staff. And at one point we actually got up to about sixteen or
                    seventeen Americans because we had seabees to help to build the new Consulate
                    General building. The minute we did reach the magic number, which as I recall,
                    also involved a magic number of military people, we were able to get APO. That
                    was probably, in terms of the American staff, my greatest achievement in three
                    years there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: APO was military postal service.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>MCKEE: Exactly, and a vast improvement over the diplomatic pouch; for example
                    when ordering stuff from Sears. That number didn't last long, we sank down to
                    ten or twelve or something, more like ten. A consular section of three or four
                    officers, an admin guy who was very good. I depended on him very heavily. A
                    communicator, again, an excellent guy, one Branch Public Affairs officer, one
                    political officer, and then a whole pack of Pakistanis. There was one political
                    local employee. There were many in the consular section who were really under
                    immense pressure. There was a corrupt atmosphere surrounding the issuance of
                    visas. It was a great big problem. They were constantly both tempted with bribes
                    and subjected to threats from Pakistanis demanding visas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did, was there much political life in the Punjab of the
                        Bhutto government, I mean were you reporting how this, how their rule was
                        working and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Oh, yes, yes, certainly we reported on her popularity, on the
                    effectiveness of her political programs. I was in touch with the People's Party,
                    her party leaders in the Punjab, so, yes, that was a regular reporting
                    responsibility.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Contact with the military there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: It was really pretty limited. There were lots of retired generals. Some of
                    them became very close friends. Other than that, the only contact that I really
                    developed, which was a very nice general commanding the fourth corps, General
                    Mahsud. We got to the point where we exchanged social visits. He, of course,
                    never talked about military strategy, which I probably wouldn't have understood
                    anyway, or about the political attitudes of the generals, which I would have
                    understood very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any, during this time were you feeling the
                        threat at all from India?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: No. The only problem was that India had a nuclear capability, and the
                    Pakistanis seemed hell-bent to develop one. I would often ask 'When you have
                    this, what do you plan to do with it? If you drop it on Delhi or Agra, first off
                    all you'll kill a lot of Muslims, and secondly, if the wind's blowing the wrong
                    direction, it'll all come back and get you anyway.” These arguments didn't make
                    much headway with the Pakistanis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to, this nuclear development in your
                        consular district or?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>MCKEE: Not really, it was sort of a federal topic. One item, though, was just
                    beginning to come up when I was there. There are lots and lots of people in
                    Lahore who are of Kashmiri descent, Nawaz Sharif's family, for example. And
                    while I was there, in that period, the Indian government, if memory serves,
                    ousted an elected government in Indian-held Kashmir and instituted a real
                    crackdown involving lots of human rights abuses. For many people that I knew in
                    Lahore, the people that were being abused on the other side of the Line of
                    Control were close relatives, and I got an awful lot of 'Why can't the United
                    States come in and stop?'</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left, were there any major developments during the
                        time you were there other than obviously the Gulf War?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Other than the Gulf War, the only other one I would say would be the
                    election of 1990. I thought Benazir would win, but she lost. We didn't realize
                    the extent to which the Army intelligence people would fix the elections, quite
                    crudely sometimes. The Embassy insisted that we get a Superior Honor Award for
                    our reporting on the campaign and polling, but I always wondered why. We didn't
                    predict the elections right or how they would be held. There is one thing I'm
                    sort of proud of. There is a group of either apostates or unorthodox or heretics
                    or whatever called Ahmadis, who originated, a little over a century ago in
                    India. They were seen by a lot of orthodox Muslims as tools of the British and
                    then as non-Muslims, but they did well in Pakistan, rose up to high positions in
                    the bureaucracy, and to some extent in the military. After some riots in '51
                    they were declared non-Muslims, so they were sort of a persecuted group. Their
                    headquarters was in Rabwa, which was in my consular district. About two months
                    before I was to leave Pakistan, spring of '91, I went off on a tour, sort of a
                    farewell tour of the Punjab, and I stopped and called on their leader. They were
                    very cordial, they were certainly happy to see me. When I got back to Lahore the
                    fundamentalist press was all over me. How could I talk to them, insulting
                    behavior, how could I talk to the apostates and enemies of Islam and all that
                    was good. I hadn't told Bob Oakley, who was my Ambassador, that I was gonna do
                    it. I didn't tell him. Because I didn't want to put him in a difficult position,
                    either telling me I couldn't go, which he wouldn't want to do, or telling me I
                    could go, which would have gotten him into trouble with elements in Pakistan. So
                    when I came back, he was able to say 'Well, you know, I didn't know about this
                    in advance, and Mr. McKee's a Foreign Service Officer, and certainly he's
                    interested in Pakistan, he's got every right to go visit them.' Human rights, I
                    was very interested in human rights, it was the right thing to do.</p>

                    not report much on the activities of the Madrassas, which we could have done,
                    and I think I would have had the access to do so. That said, in my previous
                    posting I did in fact do a long report on public education, including the
                    Madrases, and I was quite surprised the other day that Gordon Tiger, my boss
                    when I was in Karachi and a grand old man, remembered that, reminded me that I
                    had written that report.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, in the Spring of '91, you left.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: I got a reassignment to go back to Washington, where I hadn't worked in
                    since 1977, to be the office director for the Arabian Peninsula. It was a
                    position that I wanted. I did it for two years. It was undoubtedly the most
                    difficult position I ever held in the Foreign Service. I'm not a particularly
                    good bureaucrat. I didn't like Washington. I did well enough at it that at the
                    end of it David Mack, my boss and good friend who saved my posterior on many
                    occasions, asked me if I wanted to do it for another year. I said no, I didn't
                    want to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does the Arabian Peninsula encompass?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well, that was one of the problems, in a way, with the desk, it's the
                    Saudis, but it's also, we used to call them Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs if
                    the Saudis were Snow White, then you've got the Seven Dwarfs - Kuwait, Qatar,
                    Bahrain, UAE, Oman, and then there were two Yemens, only one of which we
                    recognized. So you had out there six American Ambassadors all thinking they were
                    very important people and demanding service from the desk, and then there were
                    also six Arab Ambassadors in Washington. Now Bandar, the Saudi Ambassador,
                    didn't even operate at the State Department level, by the way. He operated at
                    the White House level. But the rest of these guys were fairly small fish. And
                    they often had difficulties seeing Assistant Secretaries or one of the deputies
                    for NEA, so they would come visit me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, wasn't there a carry over of globalism arms,
                        particularly after the Gulf War with Bahrain?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Oh, absolutely. Oh, yes. Relations were very, very good, particularly with
                    Kuwait, but also with the others. Other countries, except Yemen, the two halves
                    of which were united was, soon after I left as office director. Our relations
                    were very good, in that sense it was all very close.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Kuwait? What, this is sort of the aftermath of
                        the war.MCKEE: The flames were still burning when I became Office Director
                        so there was a whole series of efforts literally of putting out the flames.
                        The Kuwaiti Ambassador, Dr. Muhammed, was a nice guy. Skip Gnehm was the
                        Ambassador in Kuwait and he was, it's not the Islamic thing so say, but he
                        was a demigod there. So that relationship was really very good. But that
                        said, you know, we urged the Kuwaitis for example to hold elections and
                        liberalize their treatment of women, because we had to justify our
                        intervention on some basis in addition to defending sovereignty and keeping
                        Saddam from the oil wells.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that go in your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: I don't know. The Kuwaitis, as I recall, were members of Parliament, they
                    certainly did hold elections, there were women members of Parliament I think.
                    But they, you know, they said yes and did nothing. Americans, they have a very
                    short attention span, everyone knows.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Qatar and the UAE, did they...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well one of the interesting things I did was to take a trip out to the
                    region with Dick Clarke, who was then the head of the whole pol-mil bureau, who
                    was then looking for places where we could pre-position materiel, but not
                    soldiers, in the event of another crisis in the Gulf. I chuckle now, because we
                    persuaded the Qataris to accept a very austere kind of depot. Now, Qatar has
                    become kind of the spear of our efforts to move into Iraq.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Oman had, was also a place where we had a lot of
                        stuff in there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Yes, we had base rights that we could use on Masirah Island. The Omanis I
                    really liked, they were really quite different from the other Gulf Arabs. For
                    one thing they had had an empire of their own, including a port on the Baluchi
                    coast of Pakistan and Zanzibar. Also in terms of Islamic strictures, they were
                    different from the others. I liked the Omanis.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk about Saudi Arabia, or Yemen, before we get to talk-
                        (end of tape)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I think it was, when the Gulf War started, it was practically the only country
                    around that supported Saddam Hussein. What happened after the war?</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>MCKEE: Well, the Yemeni economy was in pretty rotten shape because the Saudis had
                    expelled hundreds of thousands of Yemeni workers and wouldn't let them back into
                    the country. Our relations were thin, but not sort of actively antagonistic. One
                    of the key points was that there had been since time immemorial a Jewish
                    presence in Yemen, and there were some very, informal is a nice way to put it,
                    arrangements whereby these folks could leave Yemen and end up in Israel. And
                    keeping that conduit open and out of newspapers took some doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Saudi Arabia, again, this would be the aftermath of the
                        war. What were our issues with them and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well there were some lingering disputes over who would pay how much for
                    the cost of the war. I didn't get directly involved in those battles, that was
                    mostly in the Pentagon. Other questions were things like maintaining the Patriot
                    missile presence in Saudi Arabia, and, for that matter, Kuwait and Bahrain. Now
                    it's all been largely discredited, but in the immediate wake of the liberation
                    of Kuwait, the Patriot missiles were seen as just crucially important to
                    maintaining the security and independence of the Gulf states. The Gulf states
                    were quite willing to pay for these crews. Reflecting the desire to have a good
                    political relationship, the State Department would endorse their requests that
                    these crews stay on, but the Pentagon was quite opposed. These unaccompanied
                    postings to the Gulf resulted in a lot of refusals to reenlist among these very
                    highly trained technicians, so that was of course a source of tension with the
                    Pentagon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we trusting the Saudis to do something about the role
                        of Yemen and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: No. I could elaborate, but the answer is really no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really no. Was there any effort on any part within our
                        government or outside forces to do something about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Not that I recall. You don't want to know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did, was anybody looking again at the religious teachings,
                        because this later became important ten years later. But what was going on
                        in Saudi schools and Saudi society?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>MCKEE: In that period, '91 to '93, by that time there were very few Saudis in
                    American universities. Twenty years earlier there had been as many as twelve
                    thousand. But the Saudis had built up these local universities, some departments
                    staffed by Western expatriates, but most departments staffed by Palestinians and
                    Egyptians and Sudanese and what have you. The curriculum and all was very
                    heavily Islamic, and Islamic precepts even influenced other areas, science for
                    example, English literature, if you were teaching that. We certainly had the
                    sense that these were lousy universities, really, but I don't think we had the
                    sense that they were schools for fundamentalism. I was conscious, that, in the
                    aftermath of the Gulf war, the social situation in Saudi Arabia was, incredibly
                    enough, even more restrictive than it had been when I lived there from '81 to
                    '86. The religious police paid for by the state were much more intrusive than
                    they had been earlier. We, of course, made sure that everybody understood that
                    the basis of the legitimacy of the Saudi princely family was the perception that
                    they were faithful guardians of the two holy shrines. But no, I really don't
                    recall concerns that either the Saudi government, directly or indirectly or
                    individual Saudis were funding what were seen to be fundamentalist groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mention that, you know, after your time there you
                        wanted to get out of the bureaucratic battles, ins and outs didn't suit you,
                        how did this manifest itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well I thought of the endless production of briefing memos. It was often
                    just regurgitating the same information. I found that frankly extremely
                    unsatisfactory. I thought - maybe this is a confession of my own relative
                    ineffectiveness or simple lack of interest - I don't know. But I found that,
                    like when I had been Pakistani desk officer fifteen years earlier, the really
                    sexy issues were taken up by somebody else, one of the functional bureaus or
                    somebody on the sixth floor. The desk officers and the desk were sort of left
                    with the routine, boring stuff, and you know that's not particularly good for
                    morale. It wasn't good for my morale, anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did, you were there until what, '90...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: I was there for the two longest years of my life, '91 to '93. And then I
                    was up for reassignment. It's a funny story. I tried for a couple of DCMships
                    and got shot down, so I put in for some counselorships. It got sort of narrowed
                    down to Bogota, which would have meant a return to Colombia, or Ankara. I was
                    sort of leaning toward Bogota. Then I got a call from a dear friend of mine,
                    Anne Woods Patterson, who had been the Economic Counselor in Riyadh, who was
                    then I think Deputy Assistant Secretary for Latin America. She asked me what in
                    the world I was doing, bidding on this job. She said 'It's only narcotics,
                    that's all it is, is narcotics, day and night. Week in and week out.' And so I
                    backed out of that one and pushed hard for the Ankara job, which I got. The
                    Ankara job was one of the best assignments certainly that I had in my
                    career.</p>

                    on.</p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well this is a story of Angie, Angier Biddle Duke, who was a marvelous
                    Ambassador in Morocco, as I think I mentioned earlier. He told the story more
                    than once on himself. After World War II, in the late '40s, when Dean Acheson
                    was Secretary of State, we upgraded any number of legations to embassies,
                    including the one in El Salvador. And Angier Biddle Duke, who was then in his
                    late 20s or early 30s, was named Ambassador to El Salvador by the Democrats, by
                    Truman. In his interview with the Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, Acheson
                    asked him, how does it feel to be our first “shambassador” to El Salvador. Angie
                    didn't say how he responded to that really rather insulting question. He did
                    have the charm and grace and wit to tell that story himself. So now I think we
                    want to move into the...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well first place, it was '93, '94 when you came to
                        Turkey.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that go, how did you find Turkish?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>MCKEE: Well, actually, this is the kind of the thing where I break my arm patting
                    myself on the back. After Arabic and Urdu, Turkish wasn't too tough. There's a
                    lot of Turkish in Urdu and there's a lot of Arabic in Turkish, so that wasn't so
                    difficult. And thanks to Ataturk, they use the Western alphabet, the Roman
                    alphabet with a few small changes, so that wasn't so hard. But also Turkish
                    itself is, among the world's major languages, the most regular. Linguists love
                    it, because even the most common - verbs, to have, to go, to do, to be - are
                    regular. The other thing I would say is that we started in out in '93, '94, in
                    the old rented quarters in Rosslyn, which of course were wretched, poor heating,
                    poor ventilation, not designed for language teaching, but in mid-course we moved
                    into the marvelous new FSI campus at Arlington Hall, in Arlington. It was
                    subsequently was dedicated to George Schultz, and absolutely right, because it
                    was George Schultz who kept the construction money in the budget year after
                    year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he, this was his, a real consternation is that
                        probably the only Secretary of State we've ever had that really understood
                        the importance of training, except perhaps the present Secretary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: I would include the present secretary, those two, and also of course
                    they're outstanding for two reasons. They both have military backgrounds, and
                    they both carried, as far as I can see, that military concern for subordinates
                    and for management and for organization and for process into their incumbencies
                    as secretaries of state. I applaud diplomatic readiness initiative of Secretary
                    Powell, which aims at strengthening the whole training function, recruiting a
                    sufficient number of people that training assignments aren't routinely
                    curtailed, which we all know has been the case forever, especially over the

                    who do well in the training. This all redounds very much to the credit of
                    Secretary Powell. As you say, you really have to go back to George Schultz to
                    find anyone who began to have that level of passion.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: I was in Ankara from the summer of '94 to the summer of '97. That means in
                    terms of the Embassy the last few months of Dick Barkley's incumbency and then
                    actually all of Marc Grossman's incumbency. It was a marvelous assignment, in
                    the sense that our relations with Turkey are complicated, Turkey itself is a
                    very complicated country, there was an immense amount of variety. With a few
                    exceptions, the Embassy staff was absolutely superb. Certainly such colleagues
                    as Bill Eaton on the admin side, he particularly comes to mind, there was a
                    wonderful working environment overall. Grossman is of course a superb, a very
                    thoughtful guy.</p>

                    Secretary of State for European Affairs and Director General of the Foreign
                    Service. Much of the groundwork, as I understand it, for this diplomatic
                    readiness initiative of Secretary Powell's is traceable to the work that Marc
                    did when he was Director General.</p>

                    that's given me employment, an avid reader of our monthly Bulletin. I know this
                    because he sent a message saying that he was very happy that we were working
                    with AFSA on the Elderhostel outreach program. He says that his own parents were
                    avid Elderhostel people, as indeed is my own mother, and that if we ever needed
                    him for an Elderhostel program, all we'd have to do was call. By the way, this
                    is also true of Marc, if we ever need him to speak, he tries to find time for
                    us. He has come to several of the receptions that we give for newly commissioned
                    officers and their families. He is really, as an example of an absolutely superb

                <p>MCKEE: I was Political Counselor. It is important to know that there was also a
                    Political Military Counselor. The Embassy in Ankara was one of the few that
                    still retained a separate political-military section. And that obviously speaks
                    to the importance of the military relationship, military element in the
                    bilateral relationship. In terms of our relations with Turkey, first of all, the
                    whole period that I was there was a period of essentially unstable coalition
                    governments. No party had a majority in Parliament, and this meant a lot of sort
                    of jerkiness in Turkish policy. It frankly facilitated corruption at various
                    levels. Inflation was steadily eating away at the economy during the entire
                    three years that I was there. Inflation is also, as we all know, a great
                    encourager of corruption. The weakness of the coalitions also provides the
                    military opportunities to meddle in domestic, Turkish domestic politics, which
                    is, for my money, not a good thing. Internally, at that time, Mrs. Ciller was
                    the Prime Minister. She was, in great favor with the Americans, because she was
                    young and female and quite attractive and very articulate in English. She had
                    spent a year in the United States. She also proved to be a notably corrupt, for
                    my money, Prime Minister, and one who even by Turkey's low standards for
                    civilian politicians, was quick to change the coloration of her policies to suit
                    the changing political climate. Her partner, Mesut Yilmaz, was frankly no
                    better. It was a time when human rights were a major concern in the bilateral
                    relationship. Restrictions on freedom of speech, particularly, and the subject
                    of torture, we worked very hard on that one. It was also a time when the
                    Islamist political forces were on the rise. They had won the municipal elections
                    of early 1994, including the mayoral offices in such big cities as Ankara and
                    Istanbul. And indeed, in the Christmas elections of 1995, they, just by a nose,
                    came in as the largest single party in Parliament. This meant that the Embassy,
                    which was very close to the secular elite in Turkey, had to scramble a bit to
                    reach out and make contact with these Islamist forces. This was not easy. They
                    had been ignored before and they were, many of them, very narrowly educated and
                    suspicious of the United States. But actually, in a way, and again I don't want
                    to break my arm patting myself on the back, I think it was fortuitous that I had
                    come from postings to several Muslim countries where I had been involved in
                    reporting on and analyzing domestic politics. I could bring a certain
                    familiarity and a certain vocabulary to that effort. As far as I know, I was the
                    first American diplomat to call on Abdullah Gul, who is now Prime Minister of
                    Turkey. Anyway, so that was a concern. Another big concern with Iraq. And one of
                    the things that I did in the Embassy was to persuade the Ambassador to convene
                    an all-day meeting of all of the elements of the U.S. Mission, the military, the
                    less public types, what have you, the information service, everybody. Just to
                    talk about who they were and what they did with regard to Iraq, because it was
                    quite clear that Iraqi was taking up staggering amounts of our time. Now what do
                    I mean by that? I mean a number of things, on the political-military side,
                    Operation Provide Comfort, the effort by, initially the United Kingdom and the
                    United States and France, France, remember this...</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mitterrand who was the driving force behind that.MCKEE:
                        She had a very soft spot in her heart for the Kurds, for reasons that
                        probably don't belong on this tape. But anyway, yes, and so that was a
                        complicated thing, because of course there was the whole military logistical
                        aspect to it, there was indeed also a very lively domestic and
                        foreign-political aspect to it, because of course this effort protected the
                        Kurds. And one element of the Kurds at that time was in full revolt against
                        the government of Turkey, the PKK-led combination insurgency/terrorist
                        effort. So that took up a lot of time. Operation Provide comfort took up
                        time on the economic side; there were NGOs, charitable groups in the States
                        and Europe who were doing all kinds of good things in northern Iraq in the
                        zone that was protected by Operation Provide Comfort. We were trying to get
                        the two Kurdish factions together, the Talibani faction and Barzani faction,
                        so that the government in the protected area of northern Iraq could be seen
                        as democratic, as not corrupt, as effective in terms of providing social
                        services. In other words, as a counter-point to the government in Baghdad,
                        which was of course none of those things. The Turks were very suspicious of
                        this effort. It looked to them like nation-building, and they weren't
                        interested in building up anything that would look like a Kurdish nation, so
                        we had lots of things to do. I should also point out that the PKK, and I
                        insist that theirs was an insurgency/terrorist effort, was obviously a very
                        complicating factor. We had been much more forthright perhaps than the
                        Europeans. We had condemned the PKK as a terrorist organization. The
                        Europeans did not do so. We do not have a large Kurdish population in our
                        country, the Germans particularly do have a large Kurdish population in
                        theirs. So there was, there was all of that. There were many other elements
                        including, for example, the Caucusus the whole question of the Turkish role
                        and the American role and the Russian role and others' roles in trying to
                        resolve the tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The other really big
                        thing during my tenure was the effort to get the Turks into a European
                        Customs Union. In other words, the European Union would sign a free trade
                        agreement with Turkey. We accomplished it at Christmastime of 1995, I think
                        I have the date right, anyway. That was a big plus for our relations. Not
                        full membership for Turkey in the EU, but customs arrangements. The customs
                        union would have been more beneficial had the Greeks not blocked the full
                        implementation of the incentives for Turkey. Cyprus was a continuing
                        concern, Greek-Turkish relations were a continuing concern, there was a
                        dustup over of an uninhabited island, Kardak, for, I think the Greeks'
                        Ikizley, which means 'twins' for the Turks, the only way that that one was
                        solved was by direct American intervention. All in all it was a very lively
                        time. I traveled a lot around Turkey and enjoyed traveling immensely.</hi>

                        wanting contact with them, or..?</hi>

                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>MCKEE: Well first of all, in terms of my own political section, there was no
                    problem. I had such brilliant officers as Janice Weiner, whose Turkish was so
                    good. She was the human rights officer. When she conducted interviews with human
                    rights abuse victims she needed no interpreter, which changed the whole context
                    of the interview. The problems in reaching out to the Islamists were, first of
                    all, to a little extent within the Embassy. Dick Barkley particularly, for whom
                    dealing with Islamists was just simply not in his background, was very cautious.
                    Certainly our secularist contacts among the Turks were very suspicious of our
                    reaching out to the Islamists, and there were people in the States who were very
                    suspicious of this effort as well, I must confess I was encouraged a bit by a
                    visit of Mrs. Albright. When she was Permanent Representative to the UN, she
                    came out to Turkey. She convened one of those, frankly for my money, rather
                    hokey town meeting kinds of things at the Embassy. One of the comments that she
                    made in speaking to the Embassy staff, including FSNs, was that she was happy
                    that the Embassy was reaching out to the opposition because during the Reagan
                    and Bush years, when she had been in the opposition in the United States, she
                    was flattered when diplomats came to call on her. So I thought that was very
                    nice. So the opposition was more on the side of, as I say, the secularists, to
                    cast broadly, than the Islamists. The Islamists were intrigued that the
                    Americans were interested in them, a little bit apprehensive, there were
                    certainly one or two who were deeply suspicious, but on the whole they were
                    flattered and intrigued.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously we had all been bitten by the Iranian bug and
                        Khomeini's taking over. And we had to be using that as a yardstick and
                        figuring out what Islam was becoming. Where did we figure that Turkish
                        Islamists were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well, it was a difficult time, because there were some Islamic terrorist
                    groups running around Turkey, and some of them had support in various ways from
                    the Iranian Embassy. Some of these groups had killed Americans, so that was
                    certainly a concern. My own view, which I think was the prevalent view in the
                    Embassy was, if I could be crude for a minute, reflected in old LBJ line about
                    the difference between a caucus and a cactus. You know, in a caucus, the pricks
                    are on the inside, and with a cactus the pricks are on the outside... anyway,
                    that's not a very good analogy, it probably should be dropped. The Islamist
                    party was participating in the democratic and parliamentary systems in Turkey
                    with all of their flaws. They were established by the Constitution of 1983. In
                    other words, it was better to have this Islamist sentiment channeled into this
                    peaceful electoral effort, rather than isolated, and therefore have it go
                    underground and perhaps erupt in very violent and bloody ways.</p>

                <p>MCKEE: It's important to understand that, in the Muslim world, how people dress
                    is tremendously important. How people dress can indicate such things as which
                    branch of Islam they belong to, whether or not people are descended from the
                    prophet, whether or not they have gone on Hajj to Makkah, and obviously the
                    status of women is very important. But it's more than that, I mean the fact is
                    that one of Ataturk's reforms was the shapka reform. “Shapka,” is a word meaning
                    cap. It comes actually from the Russian. He decreed that Turkish men would not
                    wear turbans anymore, that they would wear European style caps, and this meant
                    the abolition of the Ottoman fez. It is also illegal for members of the Turkish
                    armed forces or the civil bureaucracy to wear beards, and I think mustaches as
                    well. You must be clean shaven. So in other words it's not only women that are
                    involved in all of these dress restrictions, but also men. Certainly on the
                    secular side, on the military side, on the Turkish republican side, the rules
                    were very strict. Women could not cover their hair if they were to appear in
                    Parliament, if they were to appear in court, if they were to teach and study at
                    the state universities. If they were to enter any government building. This, for
                    my money, worked a tremendous hardship. I'm indebted to Murat Mercan, who is now
                    the Deputy Chairman of the ruling party, the Ak Party, now they call it the
                    Justice and Development Party. Murat got his doctorate in the States, I think in
                    Florida, taught here for some years. His wife was a delightful lady who has a
                    master's degree from the States. He has been sort of the number two to Abdullah
                    Gul for many years. He's now the number two man in the ruling party. Murat,
                    pointed out to me one day that if a devout Muslim woman who interprets the faith
                    as requiring that her hair be covered is the mother/sister/wife/daughter over
                    age twelve or fourteen or something, of a Turkish soldier who is wounded and is
                    in one of the military hospitals, major ones in Ankara, she cannot visit the
                    wounded soldier in the hospital unless she uncovers her hair. This rule places
                    her in an impossible position. It's that kind of thing I think that in a lot of
                    ways fuels the Islamist vote. The other thing that fuels the Islamist vote is
                    the corruption and unresponsiveness of the secular parties. So this is a big
                    thing, that a woman who actually turned out to be an American citizen was
                    elected to Parliament on the Islamist party ticket. And she wore her head scarf
                    into parliament, it created a huge uproar, and she was basically thrown out.
                    Merve, I can't remember her last name, Kavakci. So this was a tremendous
                    issue.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did we overtly, covertly, I think that's the wrong
                        term, I mean were we telling the Turkish government, you know, this doesn't
                        work very... or did we just stay out of it?MCKEE: As I say, it's
                        complicated. In the, as I mentioned, Christmas of '95 elections, the
                        Islamists came in first. After a lot of backing and filling trying to create
                        coalitions of one kind or another, a coalition did come to power in the
                        summer of '96, led by Mr. Erbakan, the leader of the Islamist party, with
                        Tansu Ciller as his deputy, the coalition between those two parties. Now
                        Erbakan was a veteran, old time Islamist. He did frankly a lot of symbolic
                        things which were silly and upset the military and upset the middle class
                        secularists and led to his demise after a year as a leader of the coalition.
                        He visited Libya, he visited Iran, he didn't really need to do those things.
                        He talked about building a mosque in Taksim Square, which is the great
                        republican square in Istanbul. In January of '97 the National Security
                        Council recommended a whole range of things for the government to do, the
                        implementation of which essentially would have meant that the Erbakan's
                        Islamist Refah Party would have had to betray its principles. The tension
                        between the National Security Council, essentially the military and his
                        government rose. His government fell in, I think, June of '97, just as I was
                        preparing to leave Turkey. The United States in all this was sort of on one
                        foot and on the other. We thought that parliamentary democracy was a good
                        thing, so therefore we were not happy with the efforts that were mounted by
                        the secularists to declare the Refah Party illegal, which efforts eventually
                        succeeded. We were given the things like saying we support democracy and
                        secularism. Well, that's wonderful, except in Turkey in '96, '97, and some
                        would argue to the present day, these two principles may be in conflict, and
                        then what do you do? I don't think we've sort of sorted that one out,
                        yet.</hi>

                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>MCKEE: Well, you didn't, but that was a major concern the entire time I was
                    there. The Turks tend to promise more than they can deliver on human rights.
                    It's certainly true of Tansu Ciller, and Mesut Yilmaz, who was her Deputy Prime
                    Minister. Complicated issue, various aspects to it. The Turkish constitution and
                    the Turkish legal structure reflecting fear of disturbances stirred up by
                    religion and by ethnic confrontations. They place very severe constraints on
                    freedom of speech. There was the particular problem of the Kurds. Turkey for a
                    long time denied that there were any Kurds, in the country; in fact there are
                    twelve to fifteen million of them. And then finally Turkish leaders said yes,
                    there are Kurds, they're not “mountain Turks,” but you know, they're all
                    assimilated. We've had presidents and generals and ministers who are Kurdish,
                    all of which is true. But at the same time the Kurdish language was forbidden to
                    be used, or was until very, very recently. Certainly during my term it was
                    forbidden in print, which I think is a violation of the Lausanne Treaty, which
                    essentially created modern Turkey in terms of international law. And the denial
                    of cultural rights to the Kurds was really in a lot of ways the proximate cause
                    of the PKK effort. On the other hand, the Kurds have been revolting off and on
                    for the last hundred and fifty years against Turkish rule. There was a somewhat
                    separate question of torture, police torture, torture in police cells. Torture
                    by the Jandarma, particularly the intelligence arm of the Jandarma. The Jandarma
                    are a semi-military rural police force. Their lower ranks are separate from the
                    Army, but their senior ranks are filled by officers on loan from the Army. And
                    certainly there was torture by the counterterrorist branch of the police, which
                    again was a separate elite group that really operated with impunity. It was an
                    area where we continued to press. Here I think again Marc Grossman gets full
                    marks. The Europeans would just say “we detest you, you're engaged in human
                    rights abuses, this has got to stop.” Ambassador Grossman scratched around and
                    came up with public and private money to help the police with things like
                    training and forensics. Their forensics capability was pathetic. He provided a
                    technological alternative to beating, so that the police don't have to beat
                    confessions out of people, as they had done for I guess centuries in Turkey. Now
                    this is not a full answer, you also need political will from the top and you
                    also need patience, because you're talking about very deep cultural behavior
                    patterns, but I thought that Ambassador Grossman deserved full marks for
                    essentially looking at alternatives and encouraging Turks to think in new ways
                    about getting rid of torture. He was also very straightforward in talking to all
                    Turks, including Turks in uniform, about the need for human rights reform. He
                    was also very blunt in saying 'Look, you Turks can make the sequential argument
                    that we cannot do anything about human rights until we defeat the PKK
                    terrorism,' then he said, 'It's not sequential, it's parallel, you've gotta do
                    both things at the same time, as hard as that is.' And I remember a Turkish
                    member of Parliament telling me that it was very difficult for him to advocate
                    human rights reforms, when he had to go back to his constituency and appear at
                    funerals of nineteen-year-old kids who had been killed fighting the PKK down in
                    southeastern Turkey. If you advocate human rights reforms in that environment,
                    the people assembled for the funeral simply see it as apologizing for
                    terrorism.</p>

                <p>MCKEE: Our Congress, and press, and the various people there, meaning
                    Armenian-Americans, would press the White House to issue a statement on the
                    Armenian massacres using the word 'genocide.' That's one of those words that
                    really sets off the Turks, and so we would have our annual confrontation about
                    that. As we had our annual confrontation on the human rights report. The Turkish
                    Government was very cooperative as we worked to put together the human rights
                    report. In some ways they got sandbagged, because we used their material, and
                    they didn't look good. The Turkish section of the annual human rights report was
                    longer than that on almost any other country. In a lot of ways it pays countries
                    where human rights are abused not to cooperate with the U.S. Government, because
                    basically the U.S. Government then sandbags them. On that particular question of
                    the Armenian massacre, the President did not ever during the years I was there
                    use the word 'genocide'. It's a very complicated question. For my money the
                    historical case is unproven one way or another. There's no question that
                    millions of Armenians died, there is no question that a lot of Turks died,
                    there's no question that there was a series of bad harvests, there's no question
                    that Turkey was at war with Russia, there's no question that some Armenians
                    collaborated with the Russians. The real question is whether the Ottoman
                    government, actually it was the “Young Turk” government, ordered the expulsion
                    and massacre of the Armenians. That's, for my money still not clear.</p>

                <p>MCKEE: There was a legitimate Kurdish party, and at one point in alliance with
                    other parties in the early '90s, it had representation in Parliament. Under the
                    Constitution it is illegal for any party to be based on religious or ethnic
                    origins. But everybody in this one party was, essentially Kurdish. The Supreme
                    Court just declared it illegal, and it reappeared in a new guise, as often
                    happened. This happened maybe half a dozen times in the '90s. Similarly there
                    was a newspaper which was published in Turkish, which was the pro-Kurdish
                    newspaper, and it would be closed down and then it would reappear with a new

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Oh, absolutely. My line about the Kurds is that whenever three Kurds get
                    together, two will plot against the third one, who will call in outside
                    assistance. It's something that you see in a lot of cultures where you have
                    essentially mountain tribal people. They're very shortsighted, they can't see
                    into the next valley, they certainly have a lot of trouble seeing any kind of
                    larger national cause, and this makes it extremely easy for outsiders to prey on
                    the divisions, exacerbate the divisions that are already there. That's certainly
                    true in the case of the Kurds in Iraq and of Turkey. I know much less about the
                    Kurds in Iran, Syria.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well, thank God the strictly military aspects of it were the concern of
                    the Political Military section of the Embassy. I didn't have to get into that,
                    but there were a number of elements there. The first one was the question of the
                    territorial seas in the Aegean. If you accept the Greek claim then in many ways
                    the Aegean was simply barred to Turkey. There was the question of undersea
                    rights. You have to remember that some of these islands are visible from the
                    Turkish shore. They're very close together. But there's that question of
                    overflights. There was the huge question of Cyprus, and the fact that you had
                    the government of Cyprus recognized internationally, including by us, and then
                    you had the area in the north that was recognized only by Turkey. You had a very
                    high level of armaments on both sides. You had a U.N. mission which had really
                    gone nowhere since 1974. This also flowed into the whole question of EU entry
                    for Turkey, because Cyprus was also a candidate for EU membership and the Turks
                    were very sensitive about this. It's often complicated. It took up a fair amount
                    of time, not as much time as Iraq, but yes, trying to keep Turkish-Greek
                    relations on some kind of an even keel, took up a fair amount of time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Well, I think you're actually right. The Europeans tried to speak with one
                    voice on a whole range of foreign policy issues and rarely succeeded in doing
                    so. We engaged in major efforts, successful, to have the Turks and the European
                    Union conclude a customs agreement. The Europeans in their dealings with Turkey,
                    first of all, had to think of the fact that there is a large and essentially
                    unassimilated Turkish minority in a number of countries, primarily Germany. They
                    had to deal with the fact that there's a lot of history there. The “terrible
                    Turk” is a phrase that goes back to the Bulgarian massacres in the 1870s, when
                    the liberal prime minister in Britain was horrified by that. For some people it
                    goes back to the siege of Vienna, the two sieges of Vienna, actually, it must
                    have been 1683. There are certainly Europeans who think of Europe as a Christian
                    continent, and the European Union is in many ways a Christian organization. The
                    Turks know this, and they resent it. I must say there are also a lot of
                    Europeans who see very solid economic and even political reasons to bring Turkey
                    into the European Union. Anyway, the Europeans resented our pressure to them on
                    behalf of the Turks. On the other hand, I've gotta confess that over the years
                    I've become less enamored of the Europeans. I gave dinner parties at which
                    European diplomats seated at the table with Turkish diplomats talked about
                    Turkey and about Turks as if the Turkish diplomats were simply not in the room.
                    Now Lord knows the United States has had its racial and ethnic problems over the
                    years, but there's a level of racial arrogance in Europe which far, far exceeds
                    that which foreigners are likely to experience in the U.S. When we were putting
                    this European Union customs agreement together, the Spanish were the presidents
                    of the EU for the crucial six months. We worked together very carefully,
                    closely, properly and successfully with them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did corruption affect, from our perspective, how did
                        the corruption, and what form was it taking and how did it affect the
                        effectiveness of the Turkish government?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>MCKEE: Well, regarding the effectiveness of the Turkish government, I think the
                    problem there with corruption was that really many, many, many Turks were simply
                    alienated from their own government. This corruption was just sort of additional
                    proof that this government was really not legitimate. The '83 constitution was
                    adopted under pretty dubious circumstances, so that just really made things
                    worse. Corruption affected the bilateral relationship in that U.S. investment in
                    Turkey was surprisingly small given the size of the Turkish economy. American
                    investors just didn't want to go to a place that was rife with inflation and had
                    corruption problems on top of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see the government while you were there being able
                        to deal with this, was there any interest here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: You have to say that the government didn't really care very much. I
                    certainly don't remember any common bureaucrats or what have you being hauled up
                    on corruption charges. As an example of this, one of the conditions under which
                    the coalition government, led by Erbalcan and supported by Tansu Ciller came
                    into power in summer '96 was simply that her parliamentarians would vote to
                    absolve the Islamist party of pending corruption charges, and the Islamist
                    deputies agreed to vote to absolve Tansu Ciller and her party of pending
                    corruption charges. Any government created under these circumstances cannot
                    inspire confidence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with Turkish officials?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Wonderful. I respected the Turkish officials I dealt with, primarily the
                    Foreign Ministry, but also the President's office, which is staffed to some
                    extent by Turkish Foreign Service people. Straightforward, professional,
                    unemotional, in comparison with frankly, the Arabs. I think really a lot of them
                    were very sympathetic to the United States. There were some attitudinal problems
                    - they tended to try to play us off against the Europeans, which wasn't really a
                    very profitable game for Turkey. They certainly contested the legitimacy of
                    human rights as a subject for discussions between diplomats Janice Wiener, our
                    Human Rights Officer suffered for that. But I was quite happy to defend her, and
                    I did. And I defended the legitimacy of what we were doing. But overall the
                    Turks are very good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we sort of carrying the Turkish water, trying to get
                        them more integrated into the European Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>MCKEE: Oh, yes, absolutely. No question about it, we thought that it would be a
                    good thing for Turkey and a good thing for Europe if Turkey would join the
                    European Union. There were a lot of reasons for this. Oddly enough, a lot of
                    economists said at the time about the customs agreement that it really wasn't a
                    good thing for U.S. trade and investment. It would make European goods and
                    companies more competitive in Turkey at the expense of U.S. trade and
                    investment. But I think we look at it very broadly Turkey is very important
                    Muslim majority country to the west. I noticed that some European diplomats,
                    particularly from the Mediterranean countries, Italy and Spain and maybe even
                    Greece, some of them, think that it would be a very good thing essentially if
                    the European Union had a Muslim interlocutor with the Muslim states. They of
                    course are all across the southern border, on the other side of the
                    Mediterranean from Europe. So, yes, we certainly did carry a lot of water for
                    the Turks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else we should discuss, do you think,
                        during the time you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: I think we've pretty well covered the waterfront.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well one other question, there was a political military
                        officer, but if you're dealing with political affairs, you have to keep an
                        eye on the Turkish military. They're a 300 pound gorilla. How did you work
                        this? Was your political military counselor, was he looking at the political
                        aspects, did you get together, how did you deal with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: There were three political military counselors during the three years I
                    was there. It's unfortunate, most of them were just getting started really when
                    their tours ended. Bruce Thomas, the last one, was particularly talented, but
                    they were all good officers. In the Defense Attach�'s office there was and as
                    far as I know is a guy named Bob Pistana. He is a retired Lieutenant Colonel
                    from the U.S. Army who has spent most of his adult life in Turkey. He's a
                    graduate of the Harp Akademesi - the Military Academy - and he speaks Turkish.
                    He has lots and lots of contacts among the Turkish military. I relied very
                    heavily on Bob for the political aspects of what military officers were
                    thinking. But also, you know, the Foreign Service training dies hard. I looked
                    around in the Turkish Parliament, and found one or two retired generals who'd
                    gone into politics and were members of Parliament. I went to call on them and
                    some of them gave me some very valuable insight into how senior military
                    officers looked at Turkish politics, the United States, what have you.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we concerned that at some point, given the corruption
                        problem and all, Turkish military might step in again?MCKEE: I think that we
                        were concerned during the Erbakan government, which as I said blundered from
                        one symbolic gesture to another, all of which frosted the military. We
                        worried that the military might conceivably step in again, and frankly that
                        would have had an unimaginably bad impact on Turkish relations with us and
                        Turkish relations with the Europeans. Certainly, in the spring of 1997,
                        there were concerns that that could happen.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: I did indeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where'd you go then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: I had bid for two positions, because I knew I had only a year left in the
                    Service, either the Inspection Corps, or the Examiners, Board of Examiners. The
                    Board of Examiners called half an hour before the Inspectors called, each
                    offering a job, and because the Examiners called first I was an examiner for a
                    year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: It was a lot of fun. It was a wonderful way for somebody who's spent most
                    of his adult life overseas to reconnect with all the stresses and strains and
                    glories and agonies of the U.S. society. All the tensions, for example, about
                    affirmative action came to rest very directly in the Board of Examiners. During
                    the year that I did it, '97 to '98, it was not heavy lifting. There were,
                    frankly, very few candidates running around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But this is, this is a period of posterity as regards

                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Whatever, they hadn't given the written exam. I remember particularly the
                    last several months of it - there was almost nothing to do. I enjoyed it very
                    much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of how they handled the diversity
                        issue there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>MCKEE: There certainly were no specific check-offs or quotas or anything like
                    that which are quite illegal. We were happy that the recruitment side of the
                    house which was co-located with us in Rosslyn, was making this real effort to
                    reach out to historically black colleges and otherwise to make the recruitment
                    process as open as possible. I suspect that in conducting what was called the
                    oral assessment, the oral exam. No-one's free of prejudice, and I suspect that I
                    leaned a little bit in favor of minority candidates. One thing I did notice, and
                    it's something that's been bothering me ever since, is this. Despite the best
                    efforts of all concerned in the oral assessment process despite the examiners'
                    trying to approach everything afresh, candidates who have had an internship at
                    the State Department or at an Embassy overseas, frankly have a hell of an
                    advantage over people who have not had that opportunity. We have to be clear
                    here. The ability of a student or graduate student to take a summer, or my God,
                    even six months off and take an unpaid internship is directly related to the
                    economic situation in which those persons find themselves. And I know the
                    examiners, my colleagues, did try, in the part of the exam where the candidate
                    is just supposed to think quickly on his or her feet about how he or she would
                    handle a consular or cultural or administrative problem tried not to think about
                    their own experiences in judging the candidates' responses. But nonetheless, the
                    kids that had actually been in an embassy just simply had a huge advantage.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, in '98 you retired?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCKEE: Why don't you use the English language correctly? I was retired, I was
                    selected out, I had not been promoted. Fairly early on in my career I decided
                    that I would do what I really like to do, and what I thought I was good at,
                    which was learning languages, getting into societies overseas, figuring out how
                    they worked, relating their domestic politics to U.S. foreign policy concerns,
                    Talking to people, reading, analyzing, writing and reporting. I was not a very
                    good bureaucrat in Washington, and indeed spent as little time as possible in
                    Washington. If I'd structured my career differently to the extent that any
                    officer can structure his or her career differently, perhaps I would have done
                    better. On the other hand, the Foreign Service gave me thirty-four
                    well-remunerated years, I had enough money to raise my kids and educate them
                    nicely, I had a lot of fun, and I really left with almost no regrets. I did go
                    back after six months. They asked me to go back and analyze terrorism as a
                    civilian, as a civil servant in INR, I did that very happily, but that was a
                    coda to my Foreign Service career. It enabled me to work in INR. which I had
                    never done as a Foreign Service Officer. I got to know something about areas
                    about which I knew almost nothing, like Russia and Eastern Europe, and I
                    collected from the CIA an exceptional performance award for something I had
                    written on the Caucusus, and unlike State, the CIA gave me five hundred bucks,
                    too. And on that note...</p>
