                <p>AMBASSADOR ANGIER BIDDLE DUKE</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: John McKesson </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: April 4, 1989</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Angie, do you think you might tell us something about your
                        childhood and background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUKE: I was born in 1915 in New York City. My father died when I was seven years
                    old; my mother remarried and we moved to Long Island where I went to school and
                    grew up. And at the age of twelve prior to my 13th birthday I went off to St.
                    Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire where I stayed for six years. I then
                    went to Yale University. During the summers we would visit my mother's brother,
                    Anthony J. Drexel Biddle, who was Minister to Norway and subsequently Ambassador
                    to Poland. (He was later our wartime Ambassador to the governments-in-exile in
                    London. He died in 1962 when serving as Ambassador to Spain.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell us a little about your education?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUKE: I regret to say I left Yale in my Junior year, always intending to come
                    back, but the war intervened and one thing led to another, and I never did
                    graduate. I did go to service schools and graduated from Officer Candidate
                    School at Camp Lee, Virginia, and I feel that life has given me a pretty good
                    education. Although I regret not getting my degree, I take inordinate pride in
                    the honorary degrees that have been given me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I gather that what attracted you to the foreign affairs
                        field was the contact you had with your early mentors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUKE: Yes, it was the inspiration and examples of my uncle who was serving in the
                    embassies in Europe; my education in “pre-diplomatic studies” at Yale, my
                    world-wide travels, and of course my own experience during the war in North
                    Africa, England, France and Germany. All that gave me a great feeling for
                    service abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell us a bit about your career in the way of a
                        brief overall summary?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>DUKE: I was appointed a Foreign Service Reserve Officer, Class Four in 1949 and
                    served with that rank as a secretary and consul in the embassies in Buenos Aires
                    and Madrid. My career was changed through an extraordinary circumstance when the
                    Senate Foreign Relations Committee came to Spain in 1952 to negotiate the base
                    agreement. I was made the control officer. The Senators maintained that they
                    were so satisfied by the work that I was doing for them that I was offered the
                    post of Ambassador to El Salvador; so I left the FSR ranks and became a
                    political appointee of Harry Truman for about 13 months. And during the
                    Eisenhower administration I was the president of the International Rescue
                    Committee, the largest non-sectarian refugee organization in the world. In 1960
                    I joined JFK's campaign and was appointed Chief of Protocol when he became
                    President. I stayed on for a year under LBJ who sent me to Spain in 1965 where I
                    remained for three years. He recalled me to be Chief of Protocol again for six
                    months and then appointed me to Denmark. My candidate, Hubert Humphrey, lost the
                    election so I was out the following June, 1969. President Carter appointed me as
                    Ambassador to Morocco in 1979 where I served until early 1981.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Perhaps you would like to begin by giving something about
                        your experiences in your first two posts, in Argentina and Spain?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUKE: I would like to emphasize, John, that I had close working experience with
                    all sections of the embassy in Buenos Aires. I was named staff aide to
                    Ambassador Griffis in Argentina and Special Assistant to the Ambassador while in
                    Spain. I interacted with USIA, the Political Section, the CIA, and all elements
                    from the top to bottom which gave me a really significant opportunity to be
                    substantively involved in the work of the Foreign Service and with the officers
                    of the Foreign Service. This gave me a point of view of the Service that I think
                    is somewhat unique, and certainly stood me in tremendously good stead when I had
                    the opportunity to have missions of my own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We might perhaps at this point move on to your period as
                        Ambassador to El Salvador; could you describe the political and economic
                        conditions in the country when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>DUKE: I had already had the experience of working at top levels in two large and
                    active posts “and I hit the ground running.” The president of Salvador at that
                    time was General Osorio who was the undisputed leader of the military, which
                    maintained an uneasy but working alliance with the so- called oligarchy, the
                    land-owning, coffee-growing class. This kept the country on, let us say, a
                    politically peaceful and economically productive course but one that was
                    stratified dangerously in terms of class structure. There was very little
                    opportunity for social mobility or economic flexibility. Therefore our Point
                    Four program was important. It was oriented towards widening credit for small
                    business and to purchase family plots for farmers and coffee growers. And I
                    think we were beginning to be successful. Salvador had a one crop economy,
                    coffee; and they began to expand from the export of raw bulk to process coffee
                    and to the building of a decaffeinated coffee plant and the packaging of coffee
                    products. I think that if that AID policy had been continued and if it had been
                    combined with social reform, I think Salvador would have developed more
                    peacefully, social progress could have been instituted and the events of 1980-81
                    could have been avoided or at least moderated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you attribute the fact that the social reforms
                        were not implemented?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUKE: It was a wretched structuring of society, the alliance between the
                    landowners and the army. Higher education fell into the hands of the University
                    of El Salvador which in time became radicalized and the students' Marxist ideas
                    became infectious. The increasingly detached policy of the Catholic Church and
                    liberation theology also began to take hold and I think that the growing
                    political agitation and mounting interest in social change and Marxist promises
                    did build on the evident injustices of society. In those eight years after Harry
                    Truman I believe that the seeds of discontent were successfully sown making
                    inevitable the reform and revolutionary movement that started in 1980.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you assess President Osorio as a man and as a
                        leader?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUKE: Osorio was not a charismatic leader; he was a shrewd, smart career army
                    officer who knew how to get along. He was an amiable man, and although not a
                    brilliant leader, he conveyed a sense that sound change was desirable and
                    eventually inevitable. Progress was being made during his presidency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any possibility for you to be in touch with any
                        opposition elements?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>DUKE: The opposition was not particularly in evidence. While there may have been
                    conspiratorial opposition, I really cannot recall any overt surfacing. There
                    were liberal elements in the country. You may recall that this was the time
                    Arbenz was coming into the fore and becoming a leader in Guatemala. The social
                    democratic ideas of Arbenz were spilling across the borders and inciting hopes
                    for change in the rest of Central America. Salvador was not immune to that, and
                    there were some particularly bright and intelligent leaders on the moderate
                    left, some of whom occupied cabinet positions under Osorio, who tried to
                    accommodate to this movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that US policy during the years you were
                        there was basically sound or would you have felt that changes would have
                        been preferable?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUKE: I thought that our AID program was pushing the country along and that the
                    country was evolving and there were changes taking place. But when the
                    administration changed, John Foster Dulles obviously had much more interest in
                    the East-West relationship than he did in Latin America. I don't think our
                    policy was changed; it simply fell into total neglect and the AID programs dried
                    up. This made inevitable some policy change and that change took the form of
                    maintaining the status quo in Latin America while the administration settled in
                    to structuring the policies of the Cold War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other significant events and developments
                        during your tenure as Ambassador that you feel noteworthy and could comment
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUKE: The most noteworthy was when President Osorio met with President Arbenz at
                    the Salvadoran border. He took me along with him for that meeting, and the
                    President of Guatemala was accompanied by the US Ambassador accredited to him,
                    Ambassador Schoenfeld. Nothing particularly important transpired; I think that
                    Osorio wanted to come to an understanding with his colleague across the border
                    and work out a relationship that would be acceptable to the United States,
                    Arbenz was deposed not long after I left El Salvador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving on to your responsibilities as Chief of Protocol.
                        How would you describe the overall responsibilities and duties of a Chief of
                        Protocol?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>DUKE: The Chief of Protocol is stage manager for the conduct of foreign
                    relations, it is a very fascinating and time and energy consuming position. A
                    great deal depends on the individual in charge as to just how important it is.
                    JFK was really very interested in the potential of the post. First of all he
                    felt that as President he should project the image of authority and maturity; he
                    was very sensitive about his youthfulness and his age. He wished me to project
                    the dignity and gravity of ceremonial occasions. Thus he was very interested in
                    the forms of international relations. He once asked me to devise a means of his
                    meeting the democratic leaders of the hemisphere in a way that would
                    differentiate them from dictators, those who were not elected. I came up with
                    the idea that in Washington every Chief of State or Head of Government should be
                    treated exactly the same for obvious official and state reasons. However, after
                    the visit was officially over, the President would fly democratically elected
                    leaders to his father's home in Palm Beach and spend an evening with them in an
                    informal atmosphere and thus give a special mark of recognition and an added
                    measure of personal hospitality to his democratic colleagues. He liked the idea
                    and asked me to put my proposal on paper and send it over to the Department,
                    which I did. My friend Tom Mann shot it down, saying it would endanger relations
                    with the other leaders in the hemisphere and I must say he made a persuasive
                    case. I tell that story to let you know how much importance Kennedy put on form
                    and ceremony.</p>
                <p>I was particularly interested in personalities and so was he. He asked me to send
                    him a memo on anything out of the ordinary or any observations I could make
                    after I had traveled with the Chiefs of State, the Heads of Government, after a
                    state or official visit.</p>
                <p>I must add that this was an extraordinary time in world history. The colonial
                    world was exploding into independence and we had 33 new Heads of State and Heads
                    of Government visit him in 1962. All the brand new African states were demanding
                    recognition and there were remarkable pressures on Protocol and the State
                    Department and our government to accommodate a great flood of ceremonial
                    visitors. Very few of them had had any substantive relationships with us. It was
                    an extraordinary experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must indeed have had occasion to deal with numerous
                        heads of state and government during your tour as Chief of Protocol. I
                        assume in some cases you probably noticed the reaction of the leaders to our
                        own President and our President's attitude, are there any cases that you
                        would care to comment on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>DUKE: Yes, I would like to say something about the chemistry between leaders.
                    President Johnson was always drawn and attracted to those who had been elected.
                    I remember his great affection and interest in Prime Minister Harold Wilson of
                    the United Kingdom and his stiffness and lack of communication with those who
                    inherited power, such as the Shah. Yes, the role of personality and the role of
                    chemistry in human relations is evident at the highest level. I can recall the
                    rather disappointing meeting between Prime Minister Nehru and President Kennedy.
                    JFK was a great admirer of Nehru but Nehru in turn did not reciprocate warmly.
                    He had sort of an arrogant, Oxford Blue, anti-colonialist attitude of an Indian
                    intellectual towards a young country and its leader. And he acted rather bored
                    during the whole interview with President Kennedy which seemed to put our
                    President off. It was quite noticeable. Then I can recall another time the Prime
                    Minister of Canada came to visit JFK, this was the first visitor from across a
                    border, in March of 1961, and I could feel the coldness between the two of
                    them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was John Diefenbaker?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUKE: John Diefenbaker. He had been a great friend of Eisenhower's. When I picked
                    him up at the Canadian embassy he questioned me quite closely during the drive
                    to the White House as to what kind of a person President Kennedy was. He
                    suggested that, “He will hold it against me that Ike and I were great golfing
                    buddies.” I of course replied, “Not at all,” but when we got into the Oval
                    Office the conversation was difficult; and to break the ice, the President said,
                    “Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to show you something.” He led him over to the
                    french window looking out on the rose garden and pointed to marks in the parquet
                    floor saying, “those are the holes that Ike made when he wore his golf shoes
                    into the office so that in between appointments he could pitch balls on the
                    south lawn.” It was a nice story, but instead of putting Diefenbaker at ease, it
                    made him more nervous. He was even sweating, uncomfortable with the thrust of
                    that story which brought in his friendship with President Eisenhower. Those are
                    illustrations of what I call the chemistry between leaders.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the Shah a minute ago. Would you care to
                        comment further on the reactions that you saw during any visits that the
                        Shah may have made?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>DUKE: Yes, the Shah's relationship with the President and Mrs. Kennedy was very
                    cordial and very agreeable. I can't say that there were any real problems on any
                    of the Shah's visits, other than those caused by Iranian student protestors. Let
                    me take this opportunity to differentiate between those leaders who inherit
                    their position and those people who shoot their way to power and those who are
                    elected to office. In the case of Marshal Tito, for example, who fought his way
                    to his country's leadership, he conducted himself very differently from royalty,
                    who are inclined to be deferential and somewhat uncertain of themselves in
                    dealing with true leaders. I always found elected leaders far more sure of
                    themselves than the other two. Those who arrived by force of arms were always
                    looking for legitimacy and for respect. This applied to Marshal Tito and in a
                    certain measure to the Shah. I would put the Shah somewhere in between those who
                    inherited political power and those who fought their way to it. But I do feel
                    there are different vibes between the three types.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before moving on to your tour of duty in Spain, are there
                        any final comments you would care to make about your responsibilities in
                        Protocol and what could be made of that job if a person made the most out of
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUKE: I emphasize again that Protocol is what you can make of it. I think the
                    position is a tremendous opportunity for Foreign Service Officers. I also think
                    a good spot for a Foreign Service Officer is to be Deputy Chief of Protocol. The
                    opportunity to assist the geographic bureaus and the desks when one of the
                    leaders in their area is a White House guest is really most valuable. A Foreign
                    Service Officer in Protocol could assess the leadership capabilities first hand
                    and be in a position to report on much of the substance exchanged. JFK always
                    asked me to write him a memo on what my impressions were of these leaders. On
                    occasion I did so, but I didn't have time to in many cases and I now regret that
                    very much. I think that my service in Protocol in many ways was the most
                    interesting period of my own life. Although I enjoyed being Chief of Mission in
                    four important embassies, I think that the experience of being at the center of
                    the interaction of power between the White House, the State Department and
                    Congress was heady stuff. I was able to take part in the interplay of national
                    and world personalities and forces at first hand, and in retrospect, this was
                    more absorbing than any other experience that I have had.</p>

                        State and George Ball and Averell Harriman were at the State Department.
                        They must all have participated in many of the White House functions. Do you
                        have any particular recollection of any differences or ways in which these
                        American leaders of ours in the State Department functioned, or dealt with
                        foreign leaders?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>DUKE: Dean Rusk was deeply interested in the personalities of foreign leaders in
                    a very serious, profound way. The White House staff was always denigrating Dean
                    Rusk and that didn't make his job easier; but he had an unflappable, olympian
                    nature and he would take all these slings and arrows in stride. To me he was a
                    marvelous, great statesman and superb in that respect. I will say that George
                    Ball, the Under Secretary of State, also played a tremendous role. For example,
                    when Dean Rusk was flying to Japan, and President Kennedy was assassinated, Ball
                    as Acting Secretary of State gave immediate direction to orchestrating and
                    managing the international repercussions, and I conferred with him well into the
                    night on developing policies regarding bringing delegations of world leaders to
                    the funeral.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: General De Gaulle, of course, came to that funeral, do you
                        recall any particular reactions between Johnson and De Gaulle?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUKE: Johnson, of course, was very sensitive and susceptible to the aura of power
                    and prestige surrounding the presence of General De Gaulle. The French President
                    sought him out at the reception at the State Department after Mrs. Kennedy's
                    reception at the White House and the two of them embraced each other. During the
                    day of the President's funeral there had been several rumors of assassination
                    attempts on De Gaulle's life. I was in the East Room in the White House before
                    the funeral cortege went to St. Matthew's Cathedral. A security man came up to
                    me and said there might be an assassination attempt on De Gaulle as we walked
                    the streets of Washington. I took the message to Mac Bundy, who had a good
                    relationship with De Gaulle, and I asked Mac if he would pass the word on to the
                    French President and invite him to ride to the Cathedral in an official car.
                    President De Gaulle replied by asking, “Where is Mrs. Kennedy going to be in the
                    procession?” Bundy had to say that she would be on foot at the head, and the
                    President terminated the conversation by insisting on taking his place and
                    walking as planned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was working as an assistant to Dean Rusk at the time and
                        at the reception I noticed that General De Gaulle spoke for a few minutes
                        alone with Johnson. I presume that they must have used English as Johnson
                        certainly did not speak French?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUKE: I never heard De Gaulle speak English, and I never heard Johnson attempt
                    French—I think that what happened was that De Gaulle understood English, and
                    that they made themselves understand each other. Ambassador Herve Alphand was
                    also present and it seems to me he assisted them in communicating. I did happen
                    to notice that the Kings of Norway, Sweden and Denmark were standing nearby and
                    did not participate in their conversation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I noted that just after De Gaulle came in, Johnson stepped
                        away from the receiving line and stood with General De Gaulle for at least
                        two minutes in which they were obviously talking.Moving on to your tour in
                        Spain, you indicated your two main problems that you dealt with were the
                        succession problem and US military presence. Would you care to comment on
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUKE: Yes, the item that was uppermost in everyone's mind was how Generalissimo
                    Franco was going to arrange his succession. It was important that the embassy
                    should be in contact with those who would inherit power and also those who would
                    lead the opposition. I made it my policy to try to meet as many elements on the
                    political scene as possible. This caused some problems. My old friend Antonio
                    Garrigues came around one morning informally for coffee and to let me know that
                    in his opinion I should not prejudice my otherwise good relations with the
                    Franco government by fraternizing with opposition leaders. I thanked him for his
                    interest and concern, and assured him I would, of course, accede to his
                    government's request in that regard. However, I never heard anything further
                    from official sources. That made me understand how unhappy the government was
                    with my opposition contacts but was not willing to prohibit them. So I went on
                    doing it. I would have lunch with opposition figures at their residence or Bill
                    Walker, my DCM, would give a luncheon at his house and I would attend. We would
                    thus have an opportunity to exchange ideas about the future of Spain. In brief,
                    we kept in touch with the opposition, and I also kept in touch with the members
                    of the royal family such as Don Juan. He was living in exile in Portugal and on
                    visits to our embassy in Lisbon I periodically sought him out to get his ideas
                    on how the monarchy would play its role in the post-Franco period. And then
                    whenever the young Juan Carlos, who had been named by the Generalissimo as the
                    Prince of Spain, came to be generally accepted as the successor to Franco, I
                    would call on him every month or two. So in that way it was quite possible to be
                    on top of the situation. It was, I think, ill fortune for me that Franco didn't
                    die when I was serving there. I would have loved to handle the succession for
                    the American government; but that was not to be.</p>
                <p>My other preoccupation was the American military presence. The bases agreement
                    was scheduled to be renegotiated in 1965. I was very disheartened when late in
                    January of that year President Johnson called me to come back “to be at his
                    side” (as he put it) when he ran for reelection. His telephone call from the
                    White House came during a dinner for American newspaper correspondents who were
                    stationed in Madrid. I was totally surprised by his words but there was nothing
                    I could say in reply other than: “Mr. President, I am in the middle of preparing
                    for the base negotiations and I need time to disengage myself from the process,”
                    and he said, “How much time do you need?” I said, “Give me until April 1st,” to
                    which he replied, “I'll see you on April 1st.”</p>
                <p>I came home just before April 1st, on the last day of March and my wife and I
                    were looking at the 8 o'clock broadcast speech of the President when he stated
                    that he was not going to run.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>I was very disappointed to be pulled out of the embassy in Spain before we got
                    into the heart of the military negotiations. The base agreements were the most
                    pressing problem we had in Spain. The opposition felt that the US military
                    presence was an index of our support for Franco. The one serious mistake that
                    had been made when we negotiated our agreement in 1952 was to place our major
                    air base at Torrejon. To have such a large American presence so near to the
                    Spanish capital was bound to make trouble and I am surprised in retrospect that
                    it remained as a US base as long as it did. My job, of course, was to make it as
                    palatable as possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Angie, you had occasion to deal with General Franco; would
                        you care to give us an assessment of the man and the leader as you saw
                        him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUKE: Franco was a very surprising personality. He stands in sharp contrast to
                    other more charismatic Mediterranean dictators. He was short, fat, bald and
                    unprepossessing in appearance. He was very formal, official, even cold in
                    manner. When I went to say goodbye on my farewell call he did not permit me to
                    bring an interpreter or note-taker. We spent a whole half hour alone together
                    and we discussed in detail and at some length the problems in relations between
                    our two countries. He was a career officer, a functionary and bureaucrat, and
                    obviously had great intelligence and shrewdness, but certainly he was not
                    electrifying to be with. When I told him my views on the US presence in Torrejon
                    he wouldn't reply to me. I have read the account of his meeting with Hitler at
                    the Pyrenees and how Hitler was exasperated with his uncommunicative manner.
                    Well I had been there a few years and was used to his manner but wish to
                    emphasize that I found him a most difficult personality.</p>
                <p>

                        American relations to be?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>DUKE: There is no doubt but that Americans are held in warm regard. For one thing
                    we are far away from the old, historic rivalries and conflicts that have marred
                    Spain's relationships with England and France. We come into the orbit of the
                    Spanish with an almost unmarked slate. Strangely they feel closer to Germany
                    more than to any other European power. The German Federal Republic today and
                    Spain are very close to each other. We are, because of our distance, and because
                    we admire them as a people, our relations with Spaniards are quite good.
                    However, the memories of the Spanish-American War are much more vivid to the
                    Spanish people than they are to us. The fact that Puerto Rico, Cuba and the
                    Philippines are gone due to our intervention has lived on in many peoples'
                    minds. The identification of the American government with the Franco government
                    is also a source of friction. But this is counterbalanced by the admiration for
                    our form of government and ideals; and on the whole our relations were good.
                    They admired John F. Kennedy, for example. I learned this first-hand on an
                    official visit to the ancient University of Salamanca. This was one of the very
                    few times that I had a disagreeable reception during my entire time of service
                    in Spain. When I was introduced, the students banged their desks and shuffled
                    their feet and made it impossible for me to speak. Mind you, this was in a
                    so-called police state. I waited for quite a long time, and the way I handled it
                    was to bellow at the top of my voice, “John F. Kennedy, John F. Kennedy,” and at
                    that the audience of several hundred young people fell silent.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DUKE: When you asked me to speak about Franco I haven't been very complimentary.
                    That does not mean that I did not respect the Generalissimo; I respected him
                    very much, and I respected the nature of his power and the importance he had for
                    US-Spanish relations; and I made it my policy to get along with him. But I had a
                    very different, very warm relationship with Don Juan Carlos of Spain. I would
                    call on him at the Zarzuela Palace and we would have coffee alone, the two of
                    us. He would talk to me very frankly about the relationship between himself and
                    Franco and the relationship between himself and his father Don Juan. He would
                    sometimes touch on his own vision of the future. He could be quite amusing and
                    personal. Franco treated him like a school boy and often put him to various
                    tests. One morning, on one of our regular visits, he told me he had just been
                    through quite an experience. It was a Friday and the day on which he was
                    scheduled for his weekly meeting with the Chief of State. On this occasion (just
                    a few hours previous) he was met by an El Pardo palace functionary who escorted
                    him to an unfamiliar reception room. As two huge doors were thrown open, the
                    Prince was told, “His Excellency the Generalissimo has requested that you
                    preside in his place at the cabinet meeting today.” Juan Carlos told me he took
                    his seat and asked for the agenda. It went off quite well, but it was the type
                    of thing that Franco would pull on him, testing him for his ability to handle
                    himself.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving on to your tour in Copenhagen, I assume that the
                        role of Denmark in NATO was central to US concerns at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUKE: Yes. It was an interesting contrast to come from an isolated state to one
                    that belonged to the European Community and the Western Alliance. Denmark was a
                    member of the Common Market and of NATO and therefore I found myself in the
                    mainstream of life in Europe. For me there were few problems about Denmark and
                    the Common Market; and the Danish role in NATO was always a very minimal,
                    marginal, one. While I was there I tried to have the Danes play a larger role in
                    the common defense of Europe. For example, I tried to get the Danish fighter
                    pilots to adapt their planes to carry marine mines. The geopolitical position of
                    Denmark is such that in an emergency those mines could be dropped in the
                    Skagerrak between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea which would effectively
                    bottle up at least 40% of the Soviet fleet for up to several weeks. This was a
                    brilliant idea and could put Denmark in a very important strategic position; but
                    the Foreign Minister sat on it almost at once, saying it was unthinkable to so
                    provoke the Soviet Union. I was respectful of their stand but critical of their
                    unwillingness to live up to the implications of their alliance. That was what I
                    was trying to do and I must report failure.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DUKE: I presented my credentials to King Christian, who was a ceremonial figure
                    with whom I did not otherwise connect much. I should emphasize that Americans
                    were not very popular at the time because of the war in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>The point of my story is that we had demonstrations against us, particularly when
                    Vice President Humphrey was visiting me. I also had problems in meeting students
                    at the universities in Copenhagen and Odense; they were hostile.</p>

                <p>DUKE: To go back a bit, John, from 1969 to 1979 I was out of government, working
                    in the private sector in England and then as New York City Commissioner of
                    Public Events (Chief of Protocol) in Mayor Beame's administration. In 1979, as
                    President of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, a
                    non-governmental agency, I was in my office at the Waldorf-Astoria when Cy Vance
                    called me from the State Department to say that there was a problem with King
                    Hassan II and would I accept an appointment to be Ambassador to Morocco. It
                    seems there had been a difficulty between the King and Ambassador Parker; Hassan
                    would not receive him. They knew that I had had a good relationship with King
                    Hassan dating back to my Protocol days and that I had kept up that relationship.
                    I was really thrilled to be asked to come back into the State Department and,
                    after consulting with my wife, said “Yes.” The problem with my predecessor,
                    Richard Parker, I soon found, was that he was an Arabist, spoke perfect Arabic,
                    but he had also been stationed in Rabat some years before when a coup against
                    the King had taken place. There were vague rumors circulating that the American
                    Embassy, when Parker was then DCM, was in some way aware of the coup plot
                    beforehand. It was also held against him that he had been Ambassador to Algiers
                    previously and thus came from the “enemy camp”. Just because of the eccentricity
                    of the Chief of State this very able Foreign Service Officer had to leave. Due
                    to that I was called into the breach and I resumed my relationship with Hassan
                    to get things going again.</p>
                <p>Immediately after arrival in December 1979 I was plunged into the arms sale issue
                    and the related question of Morocco's war against the Polisarios in the western
                    Sahara. I got into the first series of conversations with the King when I
                    presented my credentials and I told him quite frankly that the conditions under
                    which Congress would release arms for sale to the Moroccan military were tied to
                    Moroccan willingness to negotiate with the Polisarios. As these monthly and
                    sometimes weekly conversations with the King wore on, he began to take the
                    position that indeed de facto negotiations were going on. In January 1980 he
                    told me categorically that one of his most trusted and closest councilors was at
                    that very moment meeting with high leadership elements of the rebel forces in
                    Geneva. My cabled account of this assertion prompted my recall to Washington for
                    consultation. I met with Secretary Vance, Walter Stoessel, the Under Secretary
                    for Political Affairs and the relevant Assistant Secretary and Bureau Chief.
                    They encouraged me to confer with key members of Congress, who turned out to be
                    Senators Javits and Stone, and Congressman Solarz, among others. The upshot of
                    all this was to take the King at his word and in return relax the arms sale ban.
                    When General Haig succeeded Cy Vance in January 1981, I requested permission to
                    stay on until the first arms delivery was made; and I was asked to do so.
                    Accordingly I did not resign and leave my post until the first fighter plane was
                    delivered in late March. Subsequently the new administration completely
                    abolished the condition on arms sales.</p>
                <p>When I retired from Morocco in 1981 I organized the Moroccan American Foundation,
                    went on the board of The American Legation Museum in Tangier and have returned
                    for royal weddings and the King's birthday ceremonies.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Since 1981 I have been active as Chairman of the United States-Japan Foundation
                    (until 1986) and as Chancellor of Long Island University at Southampton, N.Y. I
                    helped organize and am currently the Vice Chairman of the Council of American
                    Ambassadors. I have served as an Official US Government Observer of the
                    elections in El Salvador. As a member of the Foreign Service Association I
                    maintain an active interest in and support for the Foreign Service of the United
                    States.</p>
