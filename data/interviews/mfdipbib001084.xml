                <p>Interviewed by: Ed Findlay </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: November 16, 1994</p>

                <p>Morton Smith Sums Up His Feelings About His Total Career and His Preference for
                    Specialization in Single Area as Opposed to Multiple Areas of Assignment</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mort, tell me in a few words what you think about your
                        USIA career in general, good or bad, before we get into the chronology.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Sure. This is Morton Smith. I joined the Agency in 1955, and retired in
                    October 1994. I had a long and, I can only describe it as a wonderful career. It
                    has been exciting, far exceeding my expectations in terms of stimulation. And
                    occasionally, but fortunately only very, very brief periods of time, there have
                    been some less than enjoyable periods. But they were very, very brief and I
                    think in this respect I am probably luckier than most people in the Agency. I
                    ended up as a Career Minister; I worked seven years at State, two different
                    assignments at State on loan, and the rest of the time with USIS. So it was a
                    winner. But as you will hear subsequently, I have some rather well-defined views
                    about the future of the Agency, the future of what we call “public diplomacy”
                    and particularly the future of the organization that carries out those
                    functions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you expand a little bit on why you said that it was a
                        winner as a career? Highlights?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>SMITH: There were a number of highlights; one obviously, the opportunity to work
                    overseas, or in Washington, on the “Far East”. The system encourages interchange
                    among the areas of concentration. In fact there were times in the Agency's
                    history when you had to sign a contract with the Agency, which in effect, said
                    that you would go with a major in one area and a minor in another area. That
                    was, I think, obviously absurd. If you know and understand and appreciate the
                    problems working in one part of the world—certainly a part of the world as
                    complex as the Far East—it makes no sense to send me to Latin America, which the
                    Agency tried to do. There's enough difference, country by country in East Asia,
                    and certainly enough difference between Northeast Asia and southeast Asia to
                    warrant a career. And I can proudly say that I beat the system. Every one of my
                    overseas assignments was in the Far East. Virtually, every one of my Washington
                    assignments dealt with the Far East. But I attribute that to my stubbornness,
                    and not to the wisdom of the system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And so you don't have a problem with the general idea of
                        diversification—getting out of one area and into somewhere else? You already
                        said that, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yeah, different strokes for different folks. I mean, some people do well
                    and would welcome diversity. And I think it's fine. I'm not at all saying that
                    everyone should be a narrow specialist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about this idea of “clientitis”...the belief that
                        after so many years in a country or an area, you tend to speak for them, not
                        for Uncle Sam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, I don't know about other people, but anybody who knows Mort Smith
                    knows that by the end of his tour he's the most rabid critic of the country he's
                    working in!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But do you think that going for a year to Florence or some
                        place and then back would give you a fresh outlook and you wouldn't be
                        completely dominated by the thoughts that you had made on the spot? In other
                        words, going in and looking freshly at a problem rather than looking at it
                        from all the baggage you've accumulated locally?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>SMITH: Yeah, sure. Change is always good but my central point is that the Far
                    East was and is so different that even though I could say I spent almost all my
                    career in the Far East, the fact is that I was dealing with Burma, whose
                    problems are different than Korea's, whose problems are different than
                    Singapore's, whose problems are different than then those of the Philippines,
                    and at different times in my career, even though I might have been dealing
                    heavily with Korea, the issues were quite different. But the final experience
                    that one accumulates is really, really necessary to understand what's going on.
                    The old concept of the generalist foreign service officer who could after two or
                    three years in Timbuktu become knowledgeable enough to get a job done reasonably
                    well and then go to Paris and do the same thing in Paris, is absurd. The world
                    is too complicated. And while there are commonalities, they certainly don't
                    override the differences. In the Far East you're dealing with roughly fifteen
                    countries and each one is really different. So after eight years in Korea, I
                    can't say I understand Koreans. I'm smart enough to know I'm just beginning to
                    understand the dimensions of the problems in Korea after eight years. How can
                    anybody hope to accomplish anything worthwhile in two or three years?</p>
                <p>Smith Discusses Value of Good Management Which Usually Originates at Field Level.
                    Asserts USIA Headquarters is Usually Inept and Irrelevant</p>
                <p>SMITH: How does one avoid clientitis? Well, that's a product of management,
                    intelligent management. You have to have leaders who understand the working
                    environment overseas, who understand the kinds of people they have brought in to
                    get the job done, and are smart enough to manage them. I can honestly say that
                    most management in this Agency over the years has been abysmally ignorant. It
                    has not equaled the level of competence of its officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Management on the spot, on the local level or from
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: From Washington. Because over the years, and this is not just nostalgia,
                    when I came into the Agency, I was the youngest in my class and as I rose
                    through the ranks, I rose very quickly. I was always the first in my pay grade.
                    I was a PAO in Korea before I was forty...I'm an old guy now, so I can speak,
                    not just from nostalgia. Over the years, I've seen the increasing irrelevance of
                    Washington to our work overseas. This is important; this is vital. It's vital in
                    my view of where the Agency is going or not going in the future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If Washington is irrelevant, where do you get your program
                        guidance? Do you just make it up out of your own head?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, mostly, mostly. What I need from Washington, and I'm not saying it's
                    a bad thing, is money and people. And quantities and qualities of them that suit
                    my needs. I spent my last assignment in Manila, an assignment that I didn't
                    particularly like, but I had to go, so I went. And I did some very, very
                    interesting things there. The best thing I did had absolutely no input from the
                    Agency, except the critical money. And when I had to get more money than the
                    Agency would have normally given me for the special project, I was fortunate in
                    knowing the bureaucracy well enough to know which Washington pocket to pick. But
                    in terms of substance, the Agency had no input into this at all and didn't have
                    to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They supported your idea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: They knew a good idea and in that sense, it was intelligent
                    management.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they reacted to the project, whatever it was, rather
                        than provide the initiative?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Right, right. I generated a major conference that was sponsored by the
                    Council on Foreign Relations in New York on the future of U.S. - Philippines
                    relations. I got the Agency to give us money for nine additional IVS
                    (International Visitor) which paid the way for these nine very prominent
                    Filipinos to attend. And then I got the Council on Foreign Relations to take
                    care of the American participants on the American side. The ideas were all ours;
                    we generated the concept. The Ambassador was an enthusiastic supporter. All the
                    rest was internal. The Agency was just there saying, “Yes,” great idea, saluting
                    and giving us the money. I had to fight to get it, because it was well beyond
                    our budget. But they were smart enough to see it was a really good idea. So, on
                    the one hand, I see that the Agency is becoming increasingly irrelevant. That is
                    both a criticism but it can be an asset too. You don't want them in your hair
                    every day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You don't want them looking over your shoulder.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Exactly. And the fact is that there is increasingly little that the Agency
                    can do to help you. You're really on your own, which is fine. But that has
                    implications for the organization in Washington, and for management, and for
                    this thing we call the Agency.</p>
                <p>Agency Policy Office Especially of Little Use. State Department Also a
                    Hindrance</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find guidance from the U.S. government lacking,
                        meaningless—from “the Agency”? Who provided the input, project by project,
                        objective oriented?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>SMITH: I'm afraid, I don't like to say this because I came in as an enthusiastic
                    USIS officer, and most of my career I was an enthusiastic USIS officer fighting
                    the enemy, which was State. Even though I had worked for them for a while and
                    knew them well enough to know what they were about, I say this very reluctantly.
                    But here, also, in the real world of working in an embassy overseas trying to
                    get a program done, the real policy guidance came from the ambassador, if
                    anybody gave you guidance at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Office of Policy was not helpful?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yeah, the policy shop, which even in its truncated present form, is
                    totally irrelevant. It had nothing to offer on what I was doing out there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is it that it's irrelevant as an office, or only the way
                        it functioned in your particular experience? I mean if you had better
                        people, better machinery for the transmission of policy guidance, would not
                        the idea of “guidance from the top” be both useful and relevant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No longer is it relevant. We don't have vehicles any more. I mean, to me,
                    the policy office would be relevant if the Agency was producing products.
                    Magazines, other printed products, if the Voice was reflecting policy in any
                    meaningful way. If the Agency's media in some way had to reflect policy. So you
                    need a policy officer, somebody who interprets what is going on from a policy
                    position. The Agency doesn't do that any more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They don't produce the products?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: They don't product the products. So whom are we making policy for? Whom
                    are we proclaiming policy for?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Presumably, if you had a chat with somebody—a journalist,
                        university professor, a politician—the substance of your conversation is the
                        “product,” instead of a magazine or a radio tape. It's your little hour-chat
                        over a beer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Sure. But I get the substance of my chat out of the wireless file, out of
                    my reading of the telegrams, classified and otherwise, texts that come through
                    the file. So the extent that those reflect the work of the policy shop, I have
                    no quarrel with them. But the policy shop has almost no meaning for me as
                    practitioner in the field directly. Its major function should be to influence
                    the Agency's media. Now, if the Agency's media aren't doing anything...</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...then its function is also to influence the Agency's
                        operators overseas in the use of media products and whatever other use
                        they're up to eight hours a day, whatever they do. Presumably, somebody back
                        home, somewhere, White House, State Department, USIA Headquarters, somebody
                        tells people in the field, “Here is our overall objective, this is what we
                        want to do.” In Laos, e.g., our policy basically was “to support the King as
                        a means of non-support for the Communist, Pathet Lao, so that his political
                        party will prevail, i.e., anti-Communism will prevail. That's our position;
                        now you promote it.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: You're right. But I don't need a policy person in Washington to tell me
                    that. I read the telegrams. I understand what the telegrams are saying, I see
                    the ambassador constantly, and other people in the mission. I am a very
                    politicized, a very politically oriented officer. To me, a good USIS officer is
                    the best single, internal political asset that an embassy has. However, he has
                    to perceive himself that way. I can't say there are lots of them, but there have
                    been PAOs and other USIS officers who think they are ivory tower intellectuals.
                    Don't dirty your hands with politics; don't propagandize, and all this other
                    stuff. They are welcome to their views. To me, we're propagandists. I'm not
                    ashamed of the term; we're involved in political warfare of one sort or another.
                    That's the essence of our business and if we can't accept that, we should go to
                    work for some foundation or other. I'm saying that if the leadership of the
                    Agency can't accept it, they should have the honesty to put the Agency out of
                    business and join the Ford Foundation or whatever.</p>

                        direction from Washington. Probably it works fine if the man on the spot is
                        fine and has got everything just right. Isn't the danger that the guy on the
                        spot, who is an activist, can activate the wrong things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Absolutely. Mistakes can be made. No question about it. And that's what
                    management is for. I'm not saying that all management should disappear. Make
                    sure the guy is doing it right. We have two managers: we have the local manager,
                    the ambassador, and we have the other manager at the area office, and between
                    the two of them there is enough opportunity for management, they have to be
                    smart enough to do the job, which is not always the case.</p>

                <p>SMITH: Okay. I always had interest in the Far East. I was born and raised in
                    Brooklyn. The usual question is, “Gee, how does someone who grew up in Brooklyn
                    develop an interest in the Far East?” And my wise-guy answer is, if you grew up
                    the way I did in Brooklyn, you'd want to get out of there any way you could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But only to the then so-called “Far East”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The Far East was far away enough, and I've always had an interest in the
                    Far East. I went to City College; I majored in history. We only had one course
                    in the Far East; I took it. I went to Yale Graduate School, Southeast Asian
                    Studies. I completed the two-year program in one year because I couldn't afford
                    to stay two years, and I had no clear-cut goals except that of wanting to work
                    in the Far East. While in Graduate School at Yale, I met a Professor of
                    Vietnamese Affairs (this was in 1952-53). He was a great figure in French
                    studies of the history of Vietnam, and taught at Yale for half a year and the
                    other half in Switzerland. I took two courses with Paul Mus and in the class was
                    John ________. I wasn't sure whether he was working for USIA—which had just been
                    formed at that time—or knew of it, I can't recall exactly. But he mentioned
                    USIA. And so it stuck on the back of my mind. I didn't do anything about it.
                    After graduate school, I was drafted. I knew I was going to be drafted, so I
                    asked to get it over with. I thought I was going to the Far East but ended up at
                    Fort Lewis in Washington State, where I stayed for twenty-one months. But one
                    day—this is literally the role of happenstance in one's life—I heard on
                    somebody's radio that the recruiter from the U.S. Information Agency was going
                    to be in Seattle. So, I got in touch with him. That was in early 1955. The
                    Agency sent me a plane ticket and asked me to come for an interview in
                    Washington. I was still in the Army. I took leave and flew to the East Coast.
                    There was no examination, no written examination.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was early 1955?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That was early 1955. My interview was fascinating. I was a G.I. and the
                    panel comprised of L.K. Little, who was the first Director of Personnel for the
                    Agency, and who had been in the Old China Customs Service. The second person, I
                    don't remember. The third person whom I do remember, however, was George
                    Hellyer. George was the East Asia Area Director at that time and had earlier
                    been a tea planter in Taiwan. Three substantive people.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I know Russ; he was in Personnel.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was one of my interviewers for Personnel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: And he may have been on my panel also. Anyhow, the interesting thing about
                    the panel was that there was no written examination. George Hellyer came into
                    the interview with some charts. Large cardboard charts. Chatting while asking me
                    about my background and the rest of it, he showed me a chart and said, “Look at
                    these charts for a while.” He had just come from the Hill, where he gave a
                    briefing for the House Subcommittee on the history of Ho Chi Minh's intellectual
                    development. He obviously had noticed I had taken some courses in Vietnamese
                    history in 1953. He asked me to talk about the relationship of Communism to
                    Nationalism. So I talked. I don't know how long, maybe a couple of hours, and
                    they asked other questions about East Asia. Then he said, “You will be hearing
                    from us.” On the way out (I insist on telling this anecdote), the Personnel
                    Officer who was in charge of me (his name is Marshall Berry), was my case
                    officer so to speak. We were in the elevator together and I said, “Well, how did
                    I do?” He said (Marshall Berry was from Kentucky or Tennessee and had a very
                    strong accent), “Well son, I don't think you did so well.” He said, “You have a
                    terrible accent. You should get some elocution lessons.” For years after, I
                    would see Marshall Berry in the halls of the Agency and we'd laughed about
                    it.</p>

                <p>First Overseas Assignment, Korea, First as JOT.Then, Branch Public Affairs
                    Officer at Kwangju</p>
                <p>SMITH: This really happened. Anyhow, eventually in the fall of 1955, the Agency
                    said I could become a USIS officer and I came to Washington for three months of
                    training. It was interesting; I had never been in that environment. They asked
                    me where I wanted to go and I said, “Well, at Yale I had courses in Vietnamese
                    history. I also had to take a language and I studied Burmese, so I thought I
                    could speak Burmese; in addition, I had other courses in Burmese history.” They
                    were going to send me to Burma but the PAO said no. He was Paul Nielsen, who
                    objected, not because of me, but because it was a sensitive period in U.S. -
                    Burmese relations, and he didn't want another person on the staff whose
                    functions would be somewhat undefined. They assigned me to Korea. I think one of
                    the secrets of a successful career is picking your boss, picking a good boss. Of
                    course, you don't pick them but anyhow in Korea (when later I did go there) as a
                    JOT, my boss was PAO John McKnight. John had been an AP correspondent in Rome
                    and elsewhere. A Southerner of the old school who loved language, he was a
                    brilliant writer who wrote a wonderful book on the Vatican and insisted on good
                    writing. I spent not quite a year in Seoul as a JOT and then was assigned to a
                    branch post (Kwangju).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Korea?</hi>

                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>SMITH: In Korea, but it could possibly have been anywhere in the world. At that
                    time, they didn't feel that JOTs fresh out of their year's training were
                    qualified as BPAO. Now, of course, they think just the opposite. But, they said,
                    “Well, Okay, we'll try it.” So I was the first JOT to be a BPAO.</p>
                <p>After Korea, Burma. With A Short Digression On What Motivated Entrance Into
                    Foreign Service And USIA</p>
                <p>SMITH: After my BPAO assignment in Kwangju, I was sent to Burma in 1958. I was
                    very fortunate to have incredibly wonderful bosses. Art Hummel was the PAO in
                    Burma; he later became the Ambassador there, and of course, still later, in
                    China. In Burma, I was an assistant CAO, in charge of exhibits, book programs,
                    and visiting performers. I was only twenty-seven years old. During my second two
                    years there, Art asked me if I would be the press attach�. At that time, there
                    was a significant press. We had a very big program, with a staff of fifteen
                    Americans at that time in USIS. The press activity was very active and
                    important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me interrupt here and get back a minute to your
                        entering the Agency—your recruitment into the Agency. Can you pinpoint a
                        little more specifically your motivation? Did you, for example, want a free
                        trip to the Far East; did you want to “do good” in the promotion of U.S.
                        policy? Was your motivation the urging by others or was your motivation
                        selfish, that “This would be a pleasant thing for me to do to make me feel
                        good?” How would you describe your motive for joining USIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The easiest way to do this would be to say all of the above. These were
                    all factors, except nobody was urging me to do it but, as I said, I always had
                    an interest in working in the Far East, and being relatively conservative in
                    politics—I believe that government is not a bad thing and that we should support
                    it. But I certainly don't have a missionary approach to the job. I have met
                    people who in our missions were sort of on a semi-religious calling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Crusading?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: There were people like that. I didn't see it that way. To me, somebody has
                    to do the government's PR work. There wasn't any one thing. I needed a job, no
                    question about that. I actually turned down two jobs with the CIA at the same
                    time. They got into my background. I don't know why I picked the Agency but it
                    had appeal in being brand new.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With people your age, if the idea of Foreign Service
                        entered your head, wouldn't you think of State first rather than CIA or
                        USIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>SMITH: I never thought of State, I can honestly say that. I never wanted to be
                    ambassador but I'll have some comments on that later on because I was a DCM. But
                    I always said to myself, if I wanted to be ambassador, I'd have joined State.
                    But I wanted to get into a business that was intellectually and professionally
                    rewarding. Where could you, while still in your twenties, have the
                    responsibilities such as those of a branch PAO?</p>

                <p>SMITH: I had over thirty local employees in Korea when I was twenty-six years
                    old.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did status have anything to do with your joining the

                <p>SMITH: Absolutely not.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It's never been a factor in my life. I spent a total of six years in Burma
                    on two different assignments. Then, when I returned home, first I was desk
                    officer, and then Policy Officer for East Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me interrupt you again and ask you a question about
                        your Burma days. Can you relate your experience in Burma to U.S. government
                        objectives? Not only what you did but why you did it and what you
                        accomplished in terms of U.S. government objectives? What were you trying to
                        achieve in Burma? To separate the Burmese from the Chinese, the Russians,
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It was a highly politicized situation, particularly in the press job. I
                    was at war with the Russians and the Chinese, and a very large significant group
                    of Burmese communists. I got to know some of these people very well.</p>

                <p>SMITH: No question about it. In those days we used to measure our effect. And in
                    Burmese, I supplied them with the wherewithal. It's a long story, and I don't
                    know all the ins and outs. Some of it was attributable to plain old choosing the
                    right guys. I had an effectiveness in the precision of my choices, and the size
                    of our press clippings reflect how much we were getting placed. Lots of papers
                    were using our stuff.</p>

                        And I could think of USIA on Pennsylvania Avenue with that little sign out
                        front, “Telling America's Story to the World”. That's what I'm supposed to
                        be doing. What the hell does that have to do with Communism vs. Democracy or
                        Democracy vs. Communism? That's what it turned into, of course, but nobody
                        ever told us this was our job, the ideological warrior.</hi>

                <p>SMITH: I might say in Burma that's where the political role of the USIS officer
                    was very significant and very clear. We were out there, lots of people talking,
                    lots of people every day. What about??? I sat down and had a meeting with this
                    guy I selected, and he told me such and such, whether it was important or not.
                    Before I knew it, I was a political operator as a by-product, a natural
                    by-product. I didn't have to go out and seek out information.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Sure. I tended to bully people myself. First, with a Burmese language
                    background. Second, with a degree in Southeast Asian studies... If you're going
                    to argue with me... Same thing was true with Korea; I had a Korean language
                    background and if you want to argue with me, fine. That's fine. But you'd better

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find people in important positions who simply
                        belittled the whole role of USIS as useless? “What are you doing fighting an

                        feel good.” Did you ever encounter that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes I did, sure. The fact that I was as politically knowledgeable as just
                    about anybody in the embassy I worked in, helped ameliorate that. Maybe I was
                    the personal exception. That could very well be, but they couldn't tell me that
                    they knew more about the political situation in any country in which I worked

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The business has changed. First, the change in numbers were staggering. In
                    the good old days of the cold War, in Burma, we had 15-16 Americans and budgets
                    of real significance. But no more. That's not to say that we should bring back
                    the Cold War to make us feel good. Obviously not. But, as I say, the nature of
                    the business has changed. We can get the job done with fewer people than before
                    at many posts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If the nature of the business has changed, maybe the
                        nature of kids has also changed. The old, one-on-one, free-wheeling style
                        that you describe would be foreign to a nineteen year old today and he would
                        somehow prefer to fit into a currently existing situation in a different
                        way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Could be. One of the things that I found so good about the Agency, and
                    some of what I've said has been negative, one of the things I found so good
                    about the Agency in its earlier days, is that we were not a homogenized group of
                    people. We were an incredibly diverse bunch that came in during the “fifties and
                    early sixties”; everything from guys just out of graduate school to guys who had
                    spent twenty years in the movie business, to a guy who had been working for the
                    Washington Post or the Star—a wide range of experiences came together under this
                    Agency and for a young guy like me, with no experience except for school and the
                    Army, it was incredibly exciting.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Now, what do we have? Now we have guys that take the same exam as the
                    State Department people do. And while they may have different backgrounds,
                    they're all sort of the same type. We have too many Ph.D.s in English and Drama.
                    I haven't done a study, but there seems to be lots of them. People's work
                    background isn't what it used to be. The work itself has changed. Yeah, it works
                    both ways—the nature of the job has changed and the kinds of people have
                    changed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you wouldn't think that your hypothetical son would

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: One of them actually tried. He came close. He passed the written and the
                    oral. But when you bring in fifty people per year instead of three
                    hundred—chances diminish. I think the Agency's future is in jeopardy.</p>

                        the future Agency. I note what kind of guidance you got and how useful was
                        it? You've already told me it wasn't worth a damn.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Except for the most part, right from the beginning, I was an enormous user
                    of the wireless file. I used to take wire stories and rewrite them and use them
                    as editorials for the leading papers. What more can you want?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure, that's useful. And you found in your work a general
                        satisfaction, did you? You felt that you were doing something
                        worthwhile?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I'm not sure you're going to find many young officers today feeling that
                    way. I could be misreading, but I don't get that feeling at all. They don't feel
                    they have an obligation to spend a lot of time working all those hours. I'm
                    sorry. You don't get the wives role. That's where the whole aspect of the
                    business has changed enormously. Wives were part of the team. The Japanese do it
                    differently. Japanese Foreign Service wives get paid for their hostess
                    activities. My wife, for thirty years, was doing this and she was getting
                    nothing but an occasional thank you from me, if that.</p>

                    that, to the extent possible, I was going to make my own assignments through the
                    personnel system because it couldn't possibly operate to my benefit. So I made
                    my own assignments after the initial two years.</p>

                    profile place</p>
                <p>—Korea—I finally ended up at ICS, with Hal Schneidman. But within a few months I

                    over. I said, “Yeah,” and I was there in two weeks. I have other examples. I

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I can honestly say that the answer is no. I think I understand myself
                    pretty well. People certainly furthered my career by calling me a hard-charger.
                    I was a hard-charger because I had a lot of energy and I worked hard and all the
                    rest of it—not because of reputation. That was never a factor. It was never a
                    factor, simply because that was the way I worked. I worked hard and fast. It was
                    not that I was seeking it. I can tell you honestly, if wanted to become
                    ambassador, I could have been ambassador later.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It really was very much like a PAO club, no question about it. Because I
                    had a lot of respect for the PAOs, or almost all of the PAOs, what they thought
                    of me was important. Good OERs (efficiency ratings) and a bunch of promotions to
                    me were secondary, but I'll never forget, one day, John McKnight spoke harshly
                    to me because I did something he didn't like, and I shaped up fast. But he was
                    smart and perceptive. He wrote in my OER in 1956: In about fifteen years, Smith
                    should be ready for a PAO position. I became PAO in Korea in 1971! It was the
                    views of the PAOs that mattered to me. I had John McKnight, Art Hummel, Jack
                    O'Brien.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Okay. I had roughly two years in Korea and almost six years in Burma. Came
                    back to the Agency for about four years in Washington, D.C. at the old East Asia
                    Office. Then in 1967, I went out to Korea again, for Language Study, and then as
                    Deputy PAO for two and a half years, then PAO for another two plus years. Then I
                    left Korea in 1973.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I gather that you found opportunity to move into positions
                        that you wanted. I mean you weren't blocked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No, I was always offered good jobs. I was young but I was lucky and had
                    good bosses and they gave me good assignments. As PAO in Korea, I noticed that a
                    lot of people were kind of surprised that anybody so young was going to be PAO
                    in a place as significant as Korea, but that worked out. When I came back from
                    Korea in 1973, as I said earlier, I worked for Hal Schneidman as one of the
                    deputies in the old ICS organization for about six months and then Art Hummel
                    called me on behalf of Phil Habib who was then the Assistant Secretary of State
                    for East Asia and who had been my ambassador in Korea. Their Public Affairs
                    Advisor slot was opening in the East Asia Bureau of State and they asked me to
                    come along and I didn't hesitate for a minute. I went over there for two-plus
                    years, absolutely wonderful years; also, terrible years because I started
                    working there on the January 15 and, of course, on April 25, 1975, Saigon fell.
                    I might say, I missed one thing. After Korea, I went to the Senior Seminar for a
                    year. I'm sorry I missed telling you that. It was a great year.</p>

                        so-called leadership factor, the ability to gather people around you and
                        lead them in certain directions. What were the technical specific qualities

                    In my case, I think I did succeed, but it was a product of—I wasn't a good
                    language student, but I made maximum used of my limited capabilities. I had
                    studied Burmese and Korean and I used what little I had reasonably well. And I
                    worked hard. I'm not the smartest guy in the world but nobody beats me for
                    diligence and energy. So I make up for it. I may not be a genius, but it's just
                    like on the tennis court, I would run my opponent ragged even though I didn't
                    have the best shots in the world. Leadership ability also is important, and it's

                    somebody I dealt with, so I felt that I should say good bye. He just knocked my

                    want you to know that if you ever want to get into politics, you let me know
                    where you're going to be, because I want to come and vote for you.” To me that
                    was a remarkable statement. Totally unexpected from a guy I barely knew but
                    there was something, and I don't say this for praise but to illustrate the
                    mysteriousness of this quality, that there was something out there and you may
                    not even know you have it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think he was right? Did you have some political
                        instincts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It's not the first time. I had forgotten but John Reinhardt once wrote in
                    an OER of mine (and John and I were good friends although I didn't really like
                    the way John ran the Agency) that I was the best politician in the Agency. I'm
                    not so sure he was praising me.</p>

                <p>SMITH: But when this guy told me that, I remembered, gee, this is not the first
                    time that this ever happened. So there's something there, but I don't know what
                    it is.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isn't it a little dangerous to be on your own for
                        guidance? To sort of think: Well, I've studied this, I've read that, I've
                        kept up with the literature and the current situation. I talk to people,
                        I've observed what's going on around me therefore I can make up my own
                        guidance, I can determine what I'm going to do in the interest of the U.S.
                        government. Isn't that a little risky?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Sure, if you're too full of yourself, if you're arrogant, if your
                    knowledge is superficial and if you ignore the guidance that is available, as
                    minimal as it might be. Now, I'm not a fool. I would read the programs, the
                    embassy traffic, the spook traffic, and get a sense of what is going on and then
                    it becomes a matter of who, in the absence of specific guidance, who says “You
                    should say such and such.” There are big, big wide areas for individual
                    variation.</p>

                    quite frankly, one of the reasons I felt it was time to retire was that I felt
                    that, hey wait a minute, I'm starting to get ambassadors out here who are not
                    only younger than I am but who know a whole lot less than I, as well as DCMs and
                    other people that I have to deal with. It's time to go.</p>

                    ambassadors (three in Manila), I felt it was enough.</p>

                <p>Processes of Formulation of Policy Guidance at Embassy Level.Dissemination to
                    Field Personnel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mort, you said earlier that, except for the Wireless File,
                        guidance from Washington to the field was not good. PAO's on the spot
                        explained U.S. government policy as best they could from the field. Now,
                        Mort, you're a pretty smart guy, widely experienced in the Agency. I'm sure
                        you wouldn't be discussing U.S. government policy unless you were totally
                        convinced you were expressing it correctly. But let's say you had a young
                        branch PAO who was new to the business and sometimes given to sounding off
                        without adequate consideration of the consequences. And suppose he was
                        planning a seminar that would get into American military commitment to
                        Korea, and that he had invited ranking military officers, both American and
                        Korean, as participants. But as branch PAO, he will be regarded as the
                        official spokesman on U.S. policy. How, in advance, do you, as PAO
                        communicate U.S. policy to him? Test him out? How do you prepare him for his
                        role? In fact, would you allow this young, inexperienced PAO to get himself
                        in the position of conducting such a seminar in the first place and to
                        invite such prominent people to participate? In any event, how do you assure
                        that American policy will be correctly and sympathetically stated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, I think every branch PAO as well as the PAO himself and other
                    members of the staff should look upon a discussion of U.S. foreign policy in any
                    particular country, or region of the world, as their bread and butter. That's
                    the essence of what we're about. So I would certainly encourage him to do so. If
                    he didn't do so, I'd kick his ass. It's necessary. At the same time, if he's
                    sitting down at a branch post two hundred and fifty miles south of Seoul, how do
                    you ensure he knows what he's talking about? Well, that's why there's a home
                    office; that's why there's a headquarters (at the embassy). You want him to make
                    sure he's getting the Wireless File and that his attention is called to the key
                    stories that may be relevant to whatever subject he's discussing. We sanitize
                    telegrams, State or other cables that we get that may be relevant. We make sure
                    he has copies of all the Ambassador's speeches and, in this case, the public
                    addresses of the Commander of CINC, and UN Commander, the U.S. military leaders,
                    that he has copies of all those. In fact, in our quarterly meetings, when I was
                    in Korea, when we took the branch PAO up to Seoul, at least every quarter, we'd
                    go through the key subjects, in terms of what our policies might be, in terms of
                    materials that may be available that he might not have ready access to that he
                    can refer to if he needs them. This is the essence of the business. We ensure
                    that there is a constant pipeline of material that is running from the
                    headquarters office to the branch PAO. And it's up to him to absorb it and to
                    meld it into a meaningful presentation. He may or may not necessarily be a
                    speaker; he could just be a facilitator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And would headquarters, USIS-Seoul, monitor the
                        program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>SMITH: Maybe, depends. If it were appropriate, if it were convenient, yes. In my
                    time in Seoul, we had a PAO, we had a Deputy, and we had a Field Programs
                    Officer who was basically the supervisor of the branches. If one or the other of
                    us was traveling at that time, in that case, we would. But I wouldn't
                    necessarily require that we monitor every program that we had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You just put your trust in your people that you have trust
                        in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And if the guy, in your view, didn't know what he was
                        talking about, you'd cut off the whole idea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I wouldn't send him to the post in the first place. If the guy is
                    incapable of managing, organizing and conducting a program like that, he
                    shouldn't be there. If I made a mistake by sending him down there, I'd know
                    about it pretty soon. And at the same time, being a branch PAO is a heavy
                    experience for a young officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sure is. They may be good in one thing—maybe they can
                        make a formal speech, write something, maybe they can deal with journalists,
                        but not do well with academic seminars.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Part of being the manager in the capital is knowing your people and
                    knowing what their capabilities are. I'm not going to send anybody down on an
                    off chance that they might be able to handle it. It's a big responsibility.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was thinking you might in your answers reflect on this
                        idea because I imagine it comes from your own experience. If you were not
                        100 percent certain about the knowledge and understanding of a branch PAO,
                        you might say, this is a situation where we want to be absolutely sure that
                        U.S. policy is correctly stated, and the policy will undoubtedly touch on
                        U.S. troop presence, U.S. troop withdrawal, U.S. troop cuts, etc. I would do
                        something like this: If the Political Officer in the embassy, “John Doe,” is
                        the number one expert on this subject, I'm going to call my BPAO in Pusan
                        and I'm going to say, “Put Doe on your panel.” Then I'd call “Doe” and say,
                        “I want you to take part.” Did that ever occur to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>SMITH: Oh, yeah, it happened all the time. If the question was how you organize
                    such a panel, sure that's an obvious answer. Get the DCM or the Political
                    Counselor or the PAO, or whoever is knowledgeable about the subject. That was
                    not the question that I was addressing. I was addressing how do I ensure that he
                    gets the guidance. Of course, one way to get the guidance is to call people at
                    headquarters. I'm talking about the guy who's there by himself and making sure
                    that he gets the materials and making sure that he comes to Seoul for quarterly
                    meetings, at which we always had briefings in the embassy. A full briefing, a
                    political briefing, he makes a round of all the guys four times a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, thank you. You'll find that in my questions I keep
                        coming back to policy guidance, and how you ensure that the people who speak
                        know what they're speaking about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Sure, that's absolutely necessary. I share your concern.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have a concern about the line of policy guidance. Does
                        it go from PAO to Ambassador, to DCM, to Political Counselor? Does it come
                        to the PAO from Washington? Does it originate from Washington before any
                        dissemination takes place in the field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It depends on what the issue is. If you're talking about big worldwide
                    issues, like population, environment in the global sense, drugs, narcotics in an
                    international sense, if you're talking about those kinds of issues, they are the
                    guidances that generally come out of Washington. The most useful guidance comes
                    out of Washington because they see the big picture. If you're talking about the
                    individual country, or the region, or the country's specific issues there, your
                    guidance and your line is within the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within the country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That's right. There may be an aspect of that that comes out of State, but
                    for the most part the Agency, except in extraordinary circumstances, is not in
                    the game of country specific policies. I would be hard pressed, quite frankly,
                    to think of a situation where the Agency can tell me in Manila, of a specific
                    line to take on a specific problem...</p>

                <p>SMITH: Working with the Ambassador, myself, the DCM and the Political Officer and

                <p>SMITH: Spends all his time worrying about the Fulbright program?</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Ship him out; send him home. He's not a PAO. To me, a PAO has to have his
                    fingers on every aspect of the program, has to be sensitive to every aspect of
                    the program. He may be culturally and informationally inclined himself, but he's
                    got to know what goes on in all program areas. For example, one of the first
                    things I did when I got to Manila, when I found out that the PAO was not on the
                    Fulbright Board, was to tell the Chairman, the CAO, “I'm not going to throw you
                    off the Board; you stay on the Board, but when your term is up you become an
                    ordinary member of the Board and I will be Chairman.” To me, that is a proper
                    role for the PAO and I did it.</p>

                        down to...we'll continue with Mort Smith's experiences in field posts, and
                        particularly, in his assignments in Singapore as DCM. Could we begin by your
                        telling us how your assignment came about—it's a bit unusual for a USIA
                        officer to be DCM. How did it come about in the first place? How did it work
                        out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yeah. It was certainly unusual. It was extraordinary. This would have been
                    in 1979. I was then Director of East Asia for USIA. I had been there two years
                    since I left State as Public Affairs Advisor in the East Asia Bureau of State.
                    My first boss there was Phil Habib, and my last boss was Dick Holbrooke, for
                    whom I worked for six or seven months. During that time, I traveled for him to
                    Hanoi and with him to Paris, so we developed a very good relationship. So, one
                    day, a few years later in 1979, Holbrooke calls me at USIA and asks if I'd like
                    to go to Singapore as DCM. I said, “What happened?” Well, the fellow that had
                    been there had apparently severely alienated the ambassador who was a political
                    appointee, a former Governor of South Dakota, so much so that they had to get
                    rid of him. They needed somebody in a hurry and somebody that Holbrooke felt
                    could not only do the DCM job himself, but also look after the care and feeding
                    of a highly political, highly inexperienced ambassador. At that point, after
                    working with John Reinhardt and Charlie Bray for two-plus years in Washington, I
                    was ready to go to Singapore. So I said, “Sure,” and that's how I got there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It worked out extraordinarily well. The ambassador had been for eight
                    years Governor of South Dakota—a very nice guy. His background is that his
                    family were very prominent business people in South Dakota; he wasn't the
                    smartest guy in the world, but he was a decent guy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Know anything about Singapore?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: He knew nothing about Singapore. Didn't even know where it was. He had a
                    charming wife and eight sons. He found himself in Singapore dealing with the
                    most demanding host government, intellectually. Unfortunately, the guy who was
                    the DCM, whom I knew from State, was a very able political officer but was
                    rather unfeeling and unsympathetic and insensitive to the ambassador's
                    shortcomings. He apparently made no secret of his views about the ambassador
                    through certain people in the community. Word apparently got back to the
                    ambassador who was insecure to begin with, and became even more so when he heard
                    of these things and eventually asked that the guy be removed. It was a matter of
                    personal relations. I mean the care and feeding of a sensitive individual. I
                    quickly established a good personal relationship with him. He realized that I
                    wasn't out to do anything except help him. I had nothing to gain by being
                    negative; I had everything to gain by being positive, helping him to do his job
                    and put the embassy back in shape, because it was in a managerial shambles. I
                    earned his confidence rather quickly, became his good friend and went with him
                    to every meeting as notetaker. I wrote every telegram he ever sent; even wrote
                    his resignation letter to the President!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you and he get some flack because of this from the
                        “traditional State types” in the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Initially, yes. There were people who were very sympathetic to the DCM and
                    some who weren't. And some generally felt that he had bad mouthed the ambassador
                    in public, but then again, I was a USIS person. I wasn't a State person, so I
                    didn't let that bother me. That wasn't a problem for me. I am who I am, and I've
                    got a job to do, an important job. It was a difficult time, the Cambodian
                    invasion had started. Singapore was the center of Asian interests in Cambodia
                    and we had a lot of work to do. And we did it and I think we did it rather well.
                    I stayed there four years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you gave the ambassador as much or more political
                        advice than the political counselor did?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>SMITH: More so. I was the chief political reporter. I handled the Cambodian
                    account which was a very sensitive one. I was the DCM in every sense of the
                    term. The manager, the manager of the embassy, and the not only political, but
                    economic measures.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think, although probably not much of a point going
                        into this since the question is speculative: Do you think this worked out as
                        well as it did partly because the ambassador was political and it might have
                        been more difficult had he been a traditional State guy who had come up the
                        ladder?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, we had a chance to answer that question because he stayed for two
                    years then resigned, and he was succeeded by a traditional, a very traditional
                    State Department officer, someone I had known when I was at State; also, it was
                    somebody with whom I had had a rather difficult time at a certain point in our
                    previous relationship. In fact, when I was told that he was coming out to
                    succeed the political ambassador, I thought, “forget it, I might as well leave
                    because it's not going to work.” I wanted to stay because of my kids' education,
                    and so I stayed and it worked out very well. We ended up being good friends
                    also.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The nature of the difficulty with this State guy—did it
                        have to do with differences of policy, or did it have largely to do with
                        positions? That he felt that a USIS officer, per se, not Mort Smith, but a
                        USIS officer, had no business being a DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No. My problems with Harry Thayer preceded Singapore. They came up when I
                    was the Area Director and he was the Director of China Affairs at State. I did
                    an end run around him bureaucratically. Dick Holbrooke was my champion. When
                    Holbrooke came out to Singapore to visit us and during the course of one visit
                    told us Thayer was coming out as ambassador, we both had a very good laugh.
                    Because we both had had the same experience. Now, the question was, “Was it
                    going to work or not?” It worked; it worked very well, and Thayer, to his
                    credit, I must say, was a real gentleman. I knew how he worked. He was a very
                    meticulous, diligent guy. And he had changed his style of work to accommodate my
                    own. And so I kept the Cambodian account. The important thing is that I was not
                    the PAO, and I think that's what is relevant for this exercise. You may come
                    from a PAO background, but I would bend over backwards to ensure that our PAOs
                    dealt directly with the ambassador. In other words, I'd want to know what was
                    going on, but they didn't have to go through me to see the ambassador. They had
                    to have direct contact. And they did. I had views on what they were doing, as
                    any DCM should.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that easier, when you had a political ambassador than
                        it was when you had a State guy? Easier for the USIS people to have direct
                        access?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>SMITH: I don't think it made much difference. The political guy did not know
                    enough of what was going on. I don't think it made much difference. I never
                    thought of it in those terms, as different. That's the important thing, and
                    clearly everybody else in my position would have done the same thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you continue on about Singapore?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I think the key was that the USIS operation had to be viewed by itself. It
                    had to operate independently even though there was a USIS officer as DCM. Now,
                    an interesting thing came up when Charlie Wick came to town on one of his
                    visits. I hadn't met him at that point. I was the Charg� during his visit. He
                    could never figure out why the Charg� was a USIS officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would the DCMship in Singapore have worked out with
                        another more traditional press-oriented USIS officer as DCM rather than
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, I was very press-oriented as a matter of fact, but I also went with
                    a cultural background. So I think more important than anything was personality.
                    Personal characteristics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The rapport between DCM and Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes.</p>
                <p>A PAO Is Better Equipped Than the Usual State Department Foreign Service Officer
                    to be a DCM. Reasons. Then Why So Few PAOs as DCMs?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Beginning with the thought that we've all heard expressed,
                        that in the case of the traditional people in State who become
                        ambassadors—that it wouldn't occur to them their number two could or should
                        be a USIS guy. They think of USIS as being off on the side somewhere. Did
                        your ambassador not think that way because he did not have a bureaucratic
                        background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The fact is, that anybody who has been a reasonably good, or good PAO, is
                    better equipped to be the DCM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'll have to ask you why?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>SMITH: Because he's had, unlike anybody else on the embassy staff, he's had
                    exposure to the widest range of activities to manage, as a PAO. He's had fiscal
                    responsibilities. He's had administrative responsibilities. He's had political
                    responsibilities. He has had programming; he has been involved in political and
                    economic programs and knows the USIS world obviously, the cultural and media
                    world. If you look at the DCM as sort of a chief executive officer under the
                    chairman of the board, the PAO is the guy who's by far the best qualified. I
                    mean the standard traditional political officer knows very little about anything
                    but political affairs. But what has he managed beyond that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, this being so, and assuming that there are others,
                        several others, many other USIS PAOs who have comparable abilities, why do
                        you think there aren't more USIS DCMs and ambassadors, while you're at
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, there are a lot of reasons. If you look at it in terms of blame, I
                    would lay the blame on two doorsteps, one is the State Department and one is
                    USIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, State would resist it but what does USIA do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: State resists it because those are the top jobs in the mission. The USIA
                    resists it as well. I know we got into this towards the end of our last tape. I
                    don't know how much was actually recorded, but the Agency has never been serious
                    as an institution about seeking DCMships or ambassadorships for people. The
                    Agency's general position, as seen by Personnel, has been, “Well, it's up to you
                    guys; you guys can work it out. We in the Agency won't stand in your way.” But
                    the burden has always been on the individual. If you know an Assistant
                    Secretary, or you know a Secretary of State or somebody high up enough to
                    influence personnel choices... The exception, of course, is minorities. If you
                    look at the list of Agency personnel who have made ambassador, you see a very
                    large list of women, which is great, but it's a separate issue. But my
                    hobbyhorse has long been that the Agency owes it to its people to make available
                    every opportunity to rise to the very top of our profession. If we define our
                    profession as the Foreign Service, as the Foreign Service Act of 1980 does, in
                    the widest sense, those from all Foreign Service agencies should be drawn upon
                    to fill the highest jobs. The Agency should do justice to its people by making
                    available Agency candidates for every DCMship and every ambassador's job for
                    which there are qualified Agency people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's like within the State Department hierarchy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>SMITH: That's right. The DCM and ambassador positions are not State Department
                    jobs. I'm sorry. The law of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 says they are not
                    State Department jobs, but Foreign Service jobs. Are we in the Foreign Service
                    or are we not in the Foreign Service? And I think that this is very important
                    because we are not giving our people a fair shake, the maximum opportunity to
                    rise to the top. They are highly qualified, they come in through the same
                    examination process as the State guys, they know that we have different career
                    paths which lead to the same goal. I'm not saying that there would be X number.
                    I'm not saying there should be quotas, but I'm saying that when you have
                    qualified USIS officers, they should be given every opportunity to be considered
                    with State Department candidates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I could expand your argument along these lines, and (maybe
                        I'll be wild enough to try and do it) that there shouldn't be any
                        distinction by agency. When you're in the Foreign Service, you're in the
                        Foreign Service. USIA officers can become political counselors and DCMs, and
                        a State guy can become PAO and that would be a good thing. Do you feel that
                        way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>USIA is Probably Destined to Disappear as an Agency and be Absorbed by State.
                    Since Agency is No Longer What It Was, Does It Make Any Difference?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, now you're touching on what I think is coming, namely, the
                    amalgamation of the Agency and State. I really feel that the Agency's days are
                    numbered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, so let's go into that: This idea that, there
                        shouldn't be any distinction between a USIA person and a State person, and
                        that, maybe, there should simply be, a Foreign Service with full
                        transferability and assignability back and forth, in which case, the idea of
                        having a separate USIA wouldn't make as much sense, but rather the idea that
                        you wouldn't see a State and USIA coming closer together, the ultimate
                        result being a large agency probably being called the U.S. Foreign Service.
                        As opposed to what, as a practical matter many people think would happen,
                        namely, USIA amalgamation into State with State remaining a distinct
                        organization.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>SMITH: Well, I think that the reality is that if there is any amalgamation, it's
                    going to be on State's terms. In other words, State will survive, but the
                    question is whether there is any need for the Agency as a separate entity. I
                    came to this conclusion very reluctantly. I really did. I remember arguing, when
                    I was at the Senior Seminar in 1974, with Art Hummel, who as a speaker at the
                    seminar, indicated his view that the Agency should merge into State. I always
                    had been vigorously against it, always a USIS chauvinist in a sense. I did, up
                    until very recently, believe that it should remain independent because we had
                    something separate and different to offer. But we are no longer offering that.
                    The budget, the kind of leadership we've had, all has conspired to make us less
                    different and less useful as a separate entity. All that separateness has done,
                    quite frankly, is create a much larger administrative managerial bureaucracy
                    that is non-productive. Absolutely. We are doing less and less for people in the
                    field. There are going to be fewer products. There's going to be less and less
                    material from Washington, so you have fewer goodies to play with. What do we
                    need all these people back here for? A big bureau, a monstrous M bureau.
                    Personnel duplication, triplication of personnel functions is shameful. Why do
                    we need so many personnel managers? I say this because over the years the size
                    of our overseas staffs have diminished. We don't have the mass of people we used
                    to have overseas, but we still have an enormous tail back here in Washington. We
                    don't need it. Also, amalgamation, of course, could put us into State with a
                    kind of interchange ability with State officers. It would be much easier once
                    you're in the system than if you're in a separate agency trying to get into the
                    top of the system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Somebody else might put it a different way. That, because
                        of the smaller size of USIA and its specific function, it would not be
                        joined with State but swallowed up by State, and State being the larger and
                        stronger agency, would keep for itself the responsible, prestigious, higher
                        paying positions and dole out to USIA the lousy jobs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I don't share that thought—for one, it seems to me that amalgamation
                    should not be the absorption of one agency by another, but rather, sort of a
                    merging of activities so the whole function becomes an integral part of State.
                    It is not a foreign body being absorbed by this big amoeba. But I must say that
                    a part of my thinking would mean that VOA and BIB, which have been joined, would
                    be hived off into a separate broadcasting entity, which is the way that it's
                    going anyhow, and let's get rid of this fiction that the Voice of America is
                    part of USIA. It's been a long time since the Voice has been part of USIA. In
                    fact, I've got lots of war stories about that. It just doesn't work that way. So
                    then, you've got the Voice separated, the broadcasting functions separated.
                    Then, I think one has to ask what is the educational function in the Agency? It
                    could very easily be part of a foundation or some other semi-academic, scholarly
                    kind of function. The Fulbright Foundation can become a separate entity.</p>

                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>SMITH: I think not. I think, obviously, that that was tried once, and I think
                    that the time has passed. CU was a bastard child—was always uncomfortable so
                    close to policy. I think that it would be a great mistake to try to put it back
                    that close to policy. But let's give the exchange people what they have always
                    wanted, namely, a certain measure of autonomy as with the broadcasters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or a certain measure of private sector.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yeah, privatization. Yes, that's right. And maybe as a place for the Arts
                    and Humanities endowments and other U.S. government funded arts and humanities
                    to be joined in some U.S. government foundation like a British Council or
                    whatever you want to call it. And so, what do you have left?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have the press information function.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Which has a natural connection to the policy apparatus in the State
                    Department. Because when you're functioning overseas, let's face it, if you're
                    in the press game, you're even going to be functioning, if you're doing your job
                    right, as the ambassador's spokesman. You have to be close to the ambassador and
                    so we've been operating schizophrenically quite frankly in a somewhat schizoid
                    manner. We haven't been intellectually honest with ourselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, of course, what you're saying is, you think it would
                        probably be a good idea for USIA to shunt VOA off on an independent side and
                        cultural affairs, educational affairs also off somewhere semi-independent
                        and the rest of the Agency function to be brought under State.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: With a glorious send off. I mean, we won, okay. We've won, we celebrate
                    our victory and we go out of business. Certain functions continue, and they do
                    so in different ways. That's the Stanton Commission Report twenty years
                    later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know this has been said many times, but the idea that
                        prevailed, it seems to me over these years, is that USIA could not have this
                        grand send off. Could not say, “We've won.” They would have to say, “We've
                        lost.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>SMITH: That's bureaucratic. I don't see it that way at all. I would have ten
                    years ago. I don't see it that way at all. The job at the Voice, there are some
                    very good jobs, namely, the country language services. One of my great
                    disappointments was that we couldn't attract more quality USIS Foreign Service
                    types to be language service chiefs. We couldn't even find one to be the number
                    two man at the Voice, the Deputy Director. My niche at the Voice was unique; was
                    Deputy Director for Modernization. I didn't want to be anything else. I was not
                    in on the normal chain of command except that we had so many changes of command
                    that I ended up running the place. But there was a Deputy Director's job and we
                    could not find a senior USIS officer to take it for a number of years. We ended
                    up first with Mel Levitsky, and later Bob Barry, both from State. And we
                    actively tried to get USIS senior guys but they didn't want it. To me, that was
                    a great mistake. A shortsightedness of my colleagues. One, they're good jobs;
                    they're very responsible jobs and there is a lot of work involved. Two,
                    institutionally it would've continued the relationship between the Agency and
                    the Voice. As fewer and fewer senior Agency people took the jobs in the Voice,
                    the two institutions got farther and farther a part.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Area directors. It depends on what level you're at. Middle grade
                    officer—policy officer in an area, desk officer; senior people—area directors,
                    or deputy associate directors, those are important jobs.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Getting back to your idea of questioning the existence of
                        the USIA as a separate agency. In order to make it, to amalgamate it, merge
                        it with State, how would you change the personnel system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, I would: One, eliminate about eighty-five to ninety percent of the
                    number of people required to service X number of people in the personnel system.
                    We don't need a separate managerial system. I'm talking about money; I'm talking
                    about the administrative services. What happens when you have a separate
                    organization is you create a separate support structure. This benefits very few
                    people except the GS-15 and SES of the Agency.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It could. It could become the public affairs/information bureau. Sure,
                    that would make a lot of sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would that mean the Agency work would just be one other
                        bureau among many, and therefore, lost, swallowed up, given a role of
                        unimportance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No. I think that depends on the leadership of the bureau, as it depends on
                    the leadership of USIA. I mean, let's face it, in the Washington scheme of
                    things, the Agency has had its ups and downs. In recent years, we haven't had
                    many ups in terms of prestige and power in Washington. We might be better off
                    having a good strong Assistant Secretary or Under Secretary for Information and
                    Public Affairs within State, and not having people who were not taken
                    seriously—even in a separate agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to the business of you looking at the Agency and its
                        Director, looking downward throughout the Agency. What about the business of
                        the Agency Director speaking for the Agency, looking upward in the
                        Washington hierarchy to the White House; the Agency's current work,
                        so-called public diplomacy, whatever you want to call it? Wouldn't it be
                        better promoted with a separate, strong head rather than with an Assistant
                        Secretary or with nobody in particular? With the function being absorbed by
                        State?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I think we've been independent since 1953 and we've had more misses in
                    terms of our failure to gain recognition than we've had successes. We have very
                    rarely been involved at the start of major issues. This has not helped us,
                    except when we've had powerful leadership like with Ed Murrow or Charlie Wick
                    for different reasons and in different ways. But the first two years of Charlie
                    were extraordinary in terms of the clout this Agency had. We've had other people
                    who had no clout and were not taken seriously and the Agency wasn't taken
                    seriously. I don't know if we're losing much. The function, the information, in
                    fact, is carried out from State in its own way. After all, their daily briefing
                    with the press is a significant public affairs/public diplomacy event to the
                    White House and the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To audiences abroad as well as to the White House.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Every day, it is a major event. They're in the public diplomacy business
                    and it's an artificial division. It really is. In the last years in the Bush
                    Administration, Baker was Secretary of State, they had the rule that nobody,
                    including ambassadors, could make a public statement that could be played back
                    to the American public, to the American media, without first having it cleared
                    at the State Department. That meant that everything, literally everything, the
                    ambassador said publicly had to be cleared. It was cumbersome and it was unreal
                    and never worked right, but it meant that every goddamned word had to go back to
                    the State Department. We were losing what autonomy we had. I spent a lot of my
                    time arguing with somebody at State who happened to be a USIS person I knew. But
                    still, she was working for State and she had her State bosses.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If USIA were to move back into State one way or another,
                        one can argue that USIS officers who moved into State would be termed
                        “crumbs” and put in unimportant positions. And one could also argue, and
                        this would be worse, perhaps, that the public affairs function would be
                        downgraded and made an unimportant part of State. What guarantee is there
                        for people who believe in the importance of the public affairs function that
                        it would survive in a merger?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The way I look at it is there are no guarantees in life. One way to do
                    this is, if you had to, you can write into whatever legislation and executive
                    order that creates this new organization, certain provisions that would provide
                    for the undiminished importance of our function in some specific ways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are you serious? Would you want to continue arguing that
                        in a merger of the traditional USIA and State functions, that they would
                        merge into a new organization rather than be swallowed up by an existing
                        Department of State? Is it realistic to think that that could ever
                        happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It's as realistic as the new organism created when CU and USIA merged.
                    Obviously, the stronger and the bigger organism is going to swallow, but it
                    could be affected by the tiny poisonous shrimp!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the larger organism is not going to change. It's just
                        going to have more people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It's going to have more people. Now the question is, how do you ensure
                    that those people are giving our people access to the opportunities in their
                    system? That's a product of management—that's a product of legislation,
                    executive orders, if you have to be that explicit. On the other hand, even with
                    the new Foreign Service Act of 1980, which says that senior people should be
                    drawn from the Foreign Service as a whole, we haven't had that happen, so that's
                    a tough nut to crack. But if you had an Under Secretary who was running the
                    thing and was committed to those goals, he'd have a better chance at getting it
                    done in State than he would outside.</p>

                        a separate identification for USIA continues? Bureaucratic inertia or

                <p>SMITH: That's part of it. I mean there's legislation that would set up a new U.S.
                    government broadcasting body. The Director of USIA is one man on the board. I
                    think we should not look upon it as a defeat or loss of prestige or anything
                    like that. It's a recognition of the new realities in the world. Our people
                    should be proud to join whatever organization has been provided, and the new
                    organization should give our people equal opportunity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you in your own career—you're a public affairs type,
                        if I may say so, and you moved up, and you spent your entire career in one
                        public affairs function or another. In a merged organization with State, the
                        new entrants who believe strongly in the importance of “public diplomacy”
                        enter the State Department, knowing that once they were accepted as a Junior
                        Trainee, they were going to be stamping visas and going to economic courses
                        and getting a branch PAO's job, then be assistant agriculture attach�, and
                        then be fifth political officer, and so on. The function and the attraction
                        of the public affairs function for such people would be lost in this big
                        three-ring circus.</hi>

                <p>SMITH: That's a serious consideration. I think it can be handled though. You'd
                    have cones. Everybody so inclined could develop his specialty. The visa line
                    thing is terrible. I don't know how you find your way around that one, but I
                    think it might be worth the price to pay, if at the other end of a career, you
                    had equal access to the top jobs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think area director jobs as they now exist in the
                        Agency would be abolished?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Probably, but not necessarily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, you couldn't have two area directors, one the
                        assistant secretary..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: But, you see, they used to have, for example, when CU was in State, you
                    would have area directors at CU. If you had a Public Affairs Bureau, you could
                    have individual directors, sure. What I'm trying to do is bring the function
                    closer geographically and conceptually to policy makers. Also, I'm trying to
                    ensure that public diplomacy practitioners are given equal opportunity to rise
                    to the top of the Foreign Service. I never thought I'd say this ten years ago,
                    but the Agency has changed so much. Everything has been cut, the staffs have
                    been cut, the kinds of things we used to send out have been reduced so much that
                    the Agency, to me, is increasingly irrelevant to our work overseas. Obviously,
                    I'm the oddball officer, but I operated for the most part without any reference
                    to the Agency except for them sending the budget. I needed the money, and people
                    I needed, but what else did the Agency ever do for me?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get books to present?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>SMITH: I could have gotten them through private sources, which is actually where
                    they came from. I don't know how many books we did get in the Philippines. We
                    drowned that country in books. They sunk beneath the sea; they lost some of
                    their seven thousand islands because of the weight of the books.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where's that, in the Philippines?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. Zillions of books over the years. Where are they? I saw some of them
                    in old warehouses out in small towns, boarded up, boxes and boxes of American
                    books.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is it fair to say that you view the political and policy
                        functions of the Agency and its people as vastly more important than the
                        cultural educational function?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I don't think I ever said that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talked about the primacy of the job, PAO and his
                        training instruction of his branch PAOs in political terms, policy terms,
                        not in ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: ... Because you premised the question on a policy seminar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. You're right, you were answering my question.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No, I see them more or less equal. You can't do one without the other. As
                    I said, I went out of my way to make sure that the PAO would take the
                    Chairmanship of the Fulbright Board because I think it was important that the
                    cultural activity not view itself as something separate from the rest of the
                    organization. In Manila, it was particularly difficult because they were
                    separated geographically. They had moved the whole cultural office out of the
                    embassy, so you had the geographic separation. But the PAO had to be part of the
                    cultural process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm running out of questions, but the microphone is yours.
                        You obviously have some strong thoughts. Any other revolutionary thoughts
                        like merging with State?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Mort Smith's Closing Observations</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>SMITH: I don't know if its that revolutionary any more. Quite frankly, I'm just
                    amazed that these people who talk about reorganizing the government haven't
                    focused on this more directly, and, maybe they have, and I may not be aware of
                    it. It's no great stroke of genius to see that as something that deserves more
                    serious consideration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think that they would have also to think more
                        about reorganizing the commercial functions, the economic functions into
                        State, more so than the information function, because they're bigger and
                        stated as being more important in the broad scheme of the bureaucracy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The Agency should not continue existence just because it exists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Bureaucrats particularly, managerial types, are very skillful in devising
                    rationales for their continued existence. I don't know what the numbers are, but
                    there are too many people managing too few people. If you talk about where does
                    the work get done, where does the actual work get done, you look at
                    administrative support and managerial support, and personnel support. You've got
                    the Agency structure, you've got the Voice structure, which is parallel. Well,
                    the Voice they say has certain special needs, and it does, but it doesn't need a
                    whole special function. In addition to that, now then, you've gotten into
                    engineering—what used to be—what is now engineering, is co-equal with VOA, that
                    used to be part of the VOA—they have their own administrative office too. And
                    then you get down here, this is the project division. They have their
                    mini-administrative office. It seems to me, administration is one of those
                    functions which can be and is, and can be more highly digitized, and probably
                    you can seriously reduce the number of people we are using—very highly paid
                    people around who do nothing, literally nothing. (That's neither here nor
                    there.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who are the people in the Agency who do the Agency's
                        work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That depends on how you define the Agency's work. It seems to me that, if
                    we're a foreign affairs agency, that's certainly a part of our work, but the
                    guys in the field are the guys that do the work and the people that most
                    directly relate to them, their desk officers, I was a desk officer, that was one
                    of the greatest jobs. You have a master out there had that to be served. You had
                    to do things for him, you had to find materials, you had to get people in
                    contact, and you had to meet people coming back on grants, and look after them.
                    I don't get the feeling that that's done as much as it used to.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, it isn't. Your concept of the desk officer is, if I
                        may say so, old fashioned. It's the old-fashioned desk officer of years ago.
                        And maybe the old fashioned field officer as well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: So, my point is that if it is pass� and no longer relevant to the needs of
                    today, that's fine. I'm not arguing that we should go back to the past. I'm
                    saying we should go forward.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, now as a technical, practical matter, how does the
                        government go about it? Does it organize its study team to repeat what Frank
                        Stanton did fifteen to twenty years ago?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: We can always form a committee. And that would take a look at the
                    information functions—sure, that's one way to do it—a blue ribbon
                    committee..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...to recommend the Agency go back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: A blue ribbon commission to study the international information activities
                    of the U.S. government and to decide how they should reflect current world
                    realities. People that feed off of it. I mean, we've got the Commission on
                    Public Diplomacy and they have a stake in the separateness. Although it
                    shouldn't be the separateness of the Agency, it should be that the Commission on
                    Public Diplomacy should have a function even if public diplomacy is totally in
                    the State Department—they should be looking at it functionally. I don't
                    necessarily equate the Agency with public diplomacy. That's the problem I have
                    with the Foundation for Public Diplomacy thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Public diplomacy is a lot of things that go on in a lot of
                        places.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: To me, it's common sense. The information age is upon us—we can't escape
                    it. What you do and say publicly has an impact on your policy, before, during
                    and after. You should take this into account as you develop policies. You can't
                    ignore it. What people think is important. You can't ignore it. All that is part
                    of having to do with USIA. In one sense, it has to be done, and we need
                    intelligent people to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It doesn't need an agency?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It doesn't need a separate agency to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, on that point, which obviously is the most important
                        and most interesting that we've discussed, I'll bring this to a close,
                        unless you have a final shot at this time.</hi>
