                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. This is a Foreign Affairs oral history interview
                        with Thomas Parker, Jr. It's the 6th of July, 2009, and this interview is
                        being conducted under the auspices of the Association for Diplomatic Studies
                        and Training, and my name is Raymond Ewing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Tom, it's really good to sit down and talk with you. I see that you have your
                    undergraduate degree from Davidson College; why don't you begin with a little
                    bit of background. Where did you grow up, how did you happen to go to Davidson
                    and then I'm also interested in what made you decide to take the Foreign Service
                    officer exam and enter the Foreign Service in 1967?</p>
                <p>PARKER: Okay, right. Well, happy to be here. I grew up in Greenville, South
                    Carolina. I lived there from age six, which would have been 1946, when my dad
                    was discharged from the U.S. Navy at the end of the Second World War and that
                    was my hometown for the rest of my childhood and teenage years, young adult
                    years.</p>
                <p>I attended Davidson, I learned of Davidson by happenstance, really. I took a trip
                    one summer with a group of boys who would hop into a school bus each summer,
                    different group every summer, hop into a school bus and travel north to Canada
                    for about 30 days and learn something about our northern neighbor, as well as
                    the northeastern United States, which was almost another country for somebody
                    from South Carolina in those days. But on our first night on the road from
                    Greenville north we stopped and slept in the gym at Davidson College, so that
                    was how I learned of Davidson College. Anyway, in due course I applied there and
                    was accepted and got a wonderful liberal arts education with a major in English
                    and American literature, minor in history. Had two or three jobs after that,
                    well, including two years in the U.S. Army. I finished college in 1961. The U.S.
                    Army was 1962 to 1964; as was very often the case in those days I took ROTC
                    (Reserve Officers' Training Corps) in college. The draft still existed so there
                    was a strong incentive to take ROTC and become an officer. The Army was after
                    Davidson and before the State Department, which I entered in the fall of
                    1967.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If I could just ask you, was your Army service all in the
                        United States or-?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>PARKER: Yes it was, which is somewhat ironic, as I will relate in a moment if I
                    may. But yes, as I recall I served at Fort Benning, Georgia, Fort Holabird,
                    Maryland, and Fort Douglas, Utah. My basic branch was artillery; my assigned
                    branch was the intelligence corps.</p>
                <p>Anyway, after Davidson I had a couple of jobs, neither one of which was fully
                    satisfactory; one with the old Southern Bell Telephone Company, one with Duke
                    Power Company, one much shorter term with one of the Atlanta banks, a law school
                    that I mentioned. I'm sorry, the Army, that I mentioned, and in the six year
                    period between Davidson and State Department I did have a year and a half at
                    Duke law school, which I dropped out of, having learned about the State
                    Department and having learned something about the Foreign Service and actually
                    having one classmate at Duke Law School who had taken the Foreign Service test
                    and passed it, although he didn't enter State. I decided to apply myself, not
                    having been, as I suggested, satisfied with my civilian employment. Didn't like
                    law school, didn't want to be a career Army person so that's how I came to apply
                    to State and passed the tests and joined up in the fall of '67.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well, I think that's not an unusual sequence and
                        pattern that- And you probably came into the State Department with not
                        necessarily a clear idea of what it entailed or not necessarily a career
                        commitment until- to see what it would be like. So you came to the Foreign
                        Service Institute, did the A-100 class. This was, of course, the Vietnam
                        period, 1967; is that where you were headed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: That was my first assignment and that actually raises a somewhat
                    sensitive point because it was only after my classmates and I showed up in
                    Washington for our training that we were told that, by the way, there's a war
                    on, the State Department is making a big contribution and all of you unmarried
                    young men can anticipate going to Vietnam, at least many of you can anticipate
                    going to Vietnam as your first assignment. Well I was more than willing to go,
                    there was no problem there, but I say it's a sensitive point because later on
                    something was developed called “the CORDS Option” which, as I understood it,
                    accepted people into the Foreign Service who otherwise would not have been
                    accepted but were accepted on the explicit condition they agreed to go to
                    Vietnam for their first assignment. So I don't know how my friends reacted but I
                    was always at pains to point out that I had not come in under the CORDS Option.
                    The irony that I referred to a minute ago, having to do with my Army service in
                    the United States, in the continental United States, was well, I joined the
                    State Department and where did they send me the first thing but off to
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Shall I continue?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Tell me what you- You did the A-100 class; what other
                        training did you do before you went to Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>PARKER: Another somewhat sore point; there were- it was about six weeks, as I
                    recall, between our graduation from A-100 and the beginning of Vietnamese
                    language training and a lot of my colleagues, not surprisingly, went directly to
                    the consular course and studied that discipline and acquired that body of
                    knowledge. I was assigned, with three or four colleagues — George Moose is the
                    only one I remember — to a project in the basement of the State Department
                    involving computerized analysis, which would be supplemented by human analysis.
                    Computerized analysis of remarks made or the written language of demarches,
                    every kind of communication from North Vietnamese sources to American diplomats
                    or through third country diplomats, coming ultimately to the United States
                    Government, having to do with the terms that might result in a ceasefire or a
                    truce or whatever the term of art was in those days, bombing cessation. So here
                    were all of these computer printouts, page after page, there'd be a dozen
                    sentences from separate conversations, each sentence addressing the same point
                    but one sentence was articulated by diplomat so-and-so at such and such a place
                    and so on and so forth, different sources, different places. And so they varied
                    slightly and the precise wording from sentence to sentence; we were poring over
                    these sentences looking for significant trends or deviations or exceptions or
                    something that might provide an opening. I don't know if you ever heard of that
                    particular project before but that's what I spent six weeks doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I've never heard of it before and it's interesting to
                        me that this was probably what, early '68?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So just before Tet, the Tet Offensive-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And here we were apparently sort of grasping for straws
                        and hoping that somehow we'd find interest in cessation of hostilities on
                        the one hand, on the other that this was very early use of computers for
                        much of anything.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. So that was interesting although I regretted for the rest of my
                    career that I had never had the consular training, just because you were so
                    frequently asked, at every cocktail party, under any circumstances, what about
                    this problem with my visa or how do I go about doing thus and so and I never had
                    the basic knowledge that I thought would have been helpful to me in those
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well it's interesting because just about all of us had
                        what was often called” Con Gen Roslyn” or the basic consular training for
                        three weeks, four weeks, whatever it was. So you missed that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: I missed that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then eventually you went into Vietnamese language
                        training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. It was a good program; it was run by Eleanor Jordan, who was a
                    distinguished linguist out in the world beyond the State Department but did a
                    very good job here at State, running both the Vietnamese and Japanese programs,
                    as I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think of her as particularly Japanese linguist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: I believe that's right, yes. So that was a very structured program, large
                    numbers of people going through the Vietnamese training. There was a new class
                    every few weeks at most, maybe more frequently, and they just came through one
                    after another. And you worked hard, it was highly structured. The model for that
                    particular course was very, very structured with lots of repetition of the
                    dialogues until we really had thoroughly memorized whatever the material was in
                    a given chapter and then on to the next chapter. The instructors were nice; we
                    made progress and actually learned to speak the language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember how long that course was or how long you
                        were in it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: I think it was 50 weeks; whether that included a week or two of various
                    studies at the beginning or that was exclusively language I don't recall but
                    either of those alternatives, it was just a little bit less than a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And do you remember what FSI (Foreign Service Institute)
                        score you got at the end of the time on the five point scale?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. Well it was probably a three, maybe a three plus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, because that was longer than- I mean, you had almost
                        a year or the equivalent of a year's training; that's longer than I think
                        quite a few people had in Vietnamese in that period, especially considering
                        that you were on language probation, you'd just come into the Foreign
                        Service. I assume you didn't have any other language?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>PARKER: Oh, I might have had a zero plus in Spanish from 10 years previously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. But that was the language on which you got off
                        probation, Vietnamese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's great. So you finally went to South Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, I went to South Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To Saigon or-?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: No, I was assigned to a province south of Saigon. I guess when we arrived
                    we were given a tour, a day or two tour of the country, flying here and there
                    and popping into places and popping out. In any event the dice were cast and I
                    was assigned to Go Cong Province which is, I believe, the second province due
                    south of Saigon. It was at the, I forget the corps designation; I think it was
                    at the top, the tiptop of the fourth corps, which was the southernmost corps
                    area in Vietnam. So I was at the province headquarters just for a few weeks or
                    so and then went out to one of the district towns, lived in a district
                    headquarters. I think the team leader, an Army major, Manuel Citroen, a nice
                    guy, a little reluctant to have me because his hooch was already crowded and he
                    didn't want to squeeze one more fellow in but I think he got used to me. There
                    was no problem getting along with all my Army buddies.</p>
                <p>It was a fascinating experience. I did have my own SUV before they were called
                    SUVs, an International Harvester Scout, and so typically on any given day I'd
                    check in with my counterpart, who was the deputy district chief, a nice young
                    man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Vietnamese.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>PARKER: Vietnamese. And chat for a bit and see what he was up to, see if he
                    wanted to go out and see anything using my transportation because he had no
                    transportation so many days we'd go out someplace together and if he didn't want
                    to go out then I'd probably go out someplace, basically observe what was going
                    on. I found pretty quickly that my effectiveness as an advisor was pretty
                    limited because all of the Vietnamese government officials I was dealing with
                    were educated and commissioned officers, competent and hard working and
                    patriotic and it was their country, after all, which they knew a lot better than
                    I did. They knew their local situation better than I did. So, I mean, maybe I
                    would be surprised to the extent that I had some influence but it wasn't as if I
                    was giving them the stone tablets from on high which they were gratefully
                    accepting and then immediately adapting their programs to my advice.</p>
                <p>So anyway, I traveled around my district and just to leap ahead to give you the
                    chronology, I ultimately was transferred to the second district and in the
                    second district I was district senior advisor, so that was nice, I suppose, in
                    terms of having a little more responsibility and looking a little better on some
                    r�sum�. One incident early in my career in the first district involved the HES;
                    are you familiar with that acronym? Hamlet Evaluation System, HES. For every
                    teeny tiny hamlet, a hamlet being the very smallest aggregation of dwelling
                    units and barnyards in the country, a system had been devised presumably
                    primarily by the Americans with perhaps some input from the Vietnamese; I don't
                    know the extent of the influence of the two parties. But it's a system for
                    rating every single hamlet and some of the questions were quite objective: Is
                    there a school in this hamlet, a primary school in this hamlet? Others were
                    somewhat subjective, what is the overall level of security? In any event I went
                    through my district's hamlets — there were, let's say twenty-five of them — just
                    as carefully as I could using the HES and in my opinion the typical hamlet was
                    overrated by at least one, maybe two letter grades; I think there were five
                    letter grades but in any event they were all overrated and I proposed to
                    downgrade them all and that proposal did not prosper. What I was told was that
                    with the passage of time, if I wanted to downgrade a hamlet or two now and then
                    that would be acceptable, we wanted accurate assessments of the situation but it
                    simply would not be acceptable to have this wholesale downgrading across the
                    district.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very interesting. But when you say “downgrade,” in
                        your judgment they should be downgraded, that meant that their security was
                        more- was less an issue or more an issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: It was probably more an issue and not just security but educational
                    level, the condition of the roads. I mean, I forget the various things that were
                    taken into account in the HES but some were, let's say, economic kinds of
                    indicators that would clearly affect the wellbeing and lifestyles of the
                    individuals or social indicators, the extent to which the government was
                    supportive and never showed its face in the hamlet.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So if the overall level of these 25 or so hamlets was
                        downgraded that would show a more difficult security situation, also that
                        other aspects of the various communities were not, perhaps as high as the
                        local officials were claiming they were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: I'm sorry; what was the last thing you said?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were claiming that they were higher than you thought
                        they actually were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, exactly. And I had no ax to grind; I was just going through this
                    list of factors for each hamlet as best I could, based on what I knew, and
                    trying to be factual and accurate and I came up with a different result. So
                    that- downgrading, the wholesale downgrading did not take place. But I always, I
                    did think and I still think that if I were President Johnson back in Washington
                    or General Westmoreland or the province senior advisor or anybody along the
                    spectrum with political or military leadership I would want my decisions to be
                    based on the best factual information that could be had coming out of, in this
                    case, Vietnam. And so I felt it was my duty to provide the best factual
                    information but at least in this instance that initiative did not advance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And was the resistance to that initiative more on the
                        Vietnamese side or the American side or-?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well I only heard of it from the American side but, I mean, the province
                    senior advisor made clear that that was just not acceptable, my downgrading of
                    twenty-three out of twenty-five hamlets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had to relate to and act as an advisor in the first
                        instance to the deputy district chief and also to the U.S. Army major; what
                        was his position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: District senior advisor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: District senior advisor, and then you were- so you were
                        sort of supervised by those two?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you, in the second instance you became the
                        district senior advisor in a different district yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. Excuse me, but let me back up. In the first case, where I was the
                    deputy district senior advisor, I advised the Vietnamese deputy district chief;
                    he did not supervise me if that's what you said.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: He did not supervise me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So who did supervise you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: The major who was the American district senior advisor. And similarly in
                    the second place, in the second district, where I was senior advisor and my
                    counterpart was a Vietnamese Army captain, who was the district chief, I advised
                    him for whatever it was worth; he did not supervise me in any way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: He accepted me graciously and I hope he took some of my advice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And who did supervise you in the second district?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: The province senior advisor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Who was an Army or diplomat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: He was a- I had two; the one rotated out and the new one rotated in. They
                    were both civilians; I think one of them was a retired military and the second
                    was maybe retired USAID (United States Agency for International Development).
                    They were both civilians. But obviously on the provincial team there'd be a lot
                    of military guys there with civilians as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And in a province typically there were three or four
                        districts or more?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well this was a small province so we had just four districts, probably
                    very small, so I can't state it as a fact but I would think that the typical
                    province had more districts.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. And as a, well in the first district or the second
                        district did you go to the provinces regularly or there was interchange with
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. Well, regularly is probably an acceptable word; that doesn't mean
                    that I went every day. I probably went at least weekly, sometimes on my own
                    initiative, sometimes there would be a meeting of all the American advisors.
                    Occasionally the province senior advisor and an entourage would come out to the
                    district for some purpose, generally not just only to meet with me but there'd
                    be a ceremony, a school to be opened or a road to be dedicated, something like
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And to what extent or to what degree did you have contact
                        relations with the embassy in Saigon or the military headquarters or
                        both?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well military headquarters not at all; with the- I mean, in the province
                    I certainly knew all the American military men on perfectly friendly terms but
                    didn't really interact professionally with them to any significant extent except
                    that I lived with them on the district teams. So far as the embassy went the
                    only interaction I had was with a woman whose name I now forget who had
                    something to do with travel and she'd made it kind of her mission in life to
                    make travel arrangements for all the FSOs (Foreign Service Officers) who were
                    serving in CORDS (Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support) out in
                    the districts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And while you were there they established the CORDS system
                        or-?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: It was there when I got there so-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were part of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: We knew we were going to CORDS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Which stood for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in South Vietnam in total then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>PARKER: Eighteen months; that was a standard tour after one year of language
                    training, which struck me as a rather short period of time but there was a war
                    going on and you know, I heard some bullets go by and mortar rounds exploding
                    very near by. But here's something that surprised me greatly, given the year of
                    language training, given the presumably successful 18 months in the country; as
                    my tour approached its end I anticipated that somebody would come up to me and
                    say “Parker, are you willing to extend?” No one ever did. I didn't volunteer so
                    I left after 18 months. But I was really very surprised by that; I'd think that
                    would be on somebody's checklist, for heaven's sake, to see if-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well they were bringing in all these new Foreign Service
                        officers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, that's true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The pipeline was being replenished, I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Would you talk a little bit more, Tom, about the security situation as you
                    experienced it? You mentioned you saw some- heard some bullets fly but you also
                    mentioned that you would have this vehicle that you would go out in. Did you
                    have a, you know, a security battalion that went along with you or how did all
                    that work? Did you go by helicopter sometimes?</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>PARKER: I probably flew in a helicopter once or twice. Well, in both districts I
                    lived in the little district compound which housed the Vietnamese district
                    government and also the American advisory team so we were all there in the
                    center of the district town, you know, a modest little town, and this compound
                    was surrounded by barbed wire and had lots of- I forget all the designations but
                    there was the regular Vietnamese army, the Army of Vietnam, there were the
                    regional forces, there were the popular forces—I'm very shaky here—and I think
                    there was yet a lower grade of militia so these people had various levels of
                    training and proficiency so the people providing our security worked in the
                    bottom couple of those four or five levels but I think they were adequate to the
                    purpose. So anyway, we slept and took most of our meals in this guarded,
                    fortified compound, notwithstanding which, in the first district, in particular,
                    we were periodically subject to mortar attacks. There was an area nearby called
                    the Coconut Grove, which is where the VC (Viet Cong) hung out, the Vietcong hung
                    out, so every so often- and this would vary so sometimes this would happen on
                    consecutive nights or several consecutive nights and other times there'd be
                    weeks between such an episode. But they'd fire a few mortar rounds; they didn't
                    have anything other than small mortars and so the rounds would come in and we'd
                    all run and hop into our two large bunkers. There was one occasion I remember
                    and cut me off if this is boring, but I was sitting back in the back of our
                    little team hooch, the rest of the team was watching some forgettable movie,
                    there were movies every night, so I was sitting back in the back reading Edwin
                    Reischauer's book, a small book about Japan because that's where I wanted to go
                    on my next assignment, and Mrs. Jordan, who we lovingly called “Ba” Jordan, “Ba”
                    is the Vietnamese term for “Mrs.”, Ba Jordan, in light of my performance in
                    Vietnamese had allowed as how I could probably study Japanese next if I really
                    wanted to, so I was reading up on Japan. And heard these mortar rounds go off.
                    The problem was that we also had the district's two or three, 105 millimeter
                    howitzers right there in the same compound that I described and they were always
                    firing out- they were firing outgoing, H&amp;A (harassment &amp; interdiction)
                    fire to harass and interdict the enemy during the night, keep them from getting
                    their sleep. And although you can distinguish incoming from outgoing, at least
                    in my case as a civilian who's reading a book, with a movie soundtrack going on,
                    I wasn't paying much attention but it did finally register on me that I heard
                    lots of chairs scraping and the running of feet and a bunch of the Vietnamese
                    kids had their faces glued to the window screen looking in so they could watch
                    the movie and they all disappeared. I kept hearing these bang bangs and finally
                    realized that it was incoming. So I ran out the back screen door, which was
                    latched, and maybe I didn't realize it, I just sort of broke it open, getting a
                    scratch in the process which sent forth a drop of blood and so I wondered if
                    maybe I might be eligible for a Purple Heart but I guess that was a military
                    decoration and I never pursued that. I went to the back bunker and it was so
                    absolutely, positively full of these Vietnamese children that I could not get
                    in, I couldn't get the slightest bit of shelter from that bunker so I turned
                    around and retraced my steps through the hooch to the front bunker, which was
                    occupied only by the Americans or maybe there were a few Vietnamese officers who
                    had been watching the movie with us so I was welcomed with open arms and relief
                    into that place. So that's an example of one security threat.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>On another occasion I was driving down this particular long, straight dirt road,
                    I think paved with this red crushed rock called laterite, it's all over Vietnam,
                    and without incident I got to the, probably, the village headquarters at the end
                    of this road and parked and went in. I had in my briefcase a 22 caliber
                    revolver, which was my personal security since I was a civilian. So I walked in
                    and was sitting there chatting with the village chief, and as I had been pulling
                    in a convoy of South Vietnamese army trucks was loading the troops who had been
                    out sweeping the area, had finished, were getting into the trucks, and they
                    piled into their trucks and left and there was a loud explosion and then this
                    enormous outburst of gunfire from the Vietnamese troops in the trucks towards
                    the tree line over yonder, a hundred yards or so. Well, there had been a
                    command-detonated mine in the road which they had detonated near one of the
                    trucks. They didn't do a very good job; a couple of Vietnamese soldiers had
                    light wounds but no serious harm was done. But the point is that I myself, in my
                    little International Harvester Scout had just driven over that very same piece
                    of roadway 15, 20 minutes, 30 minutes before and, thanks be to God, I guess the
                    guy with his finger on the plunger felt that an army truck full of troops was a
                    more valuable target than me. Maybe they didn't know my importance. In any
                    event, that was a sobering experience.</p>
                <p>And occasionally we'd be out doing something, maybe with my American district
                    senior advisor, maybe with my Vietnamese counterpart, maybe with two or three
                    people, looking at a school, looking at a road, talking to people, and there'd
                    be a sniper off somewhere and we'd hear the bullets go by. “Pssssss”. An
                    interesting noise, especially if it hasn't hit you. So that was about the extent
                    of the security threats that I faced; nothing dramatic. But of course, I knew
                    that I had to be careful so I was never driving my Jeep around after hours of
                    darkness and I never took a tour of the Coconut Grove that I mentioned; I knew
                    where I could go and where I could not go, where it would be ill advised to
                    go.</p>

                <p>PARKER: Yes, I would drive myself.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: -Vietnamese driver. Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>How- at the end of your time there, and looking back, knowing all that's happened
                    and happened in the next, say 10 years or even less than that, you know, did you
                    sort of see what was likely to happen or did you think that things were getting
                    better or, you know, you had one perspective from kind of the district
                    level.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>PARKER: I did not foresee what would happen. I didn't think that was likely to
                    happen. I saw progress; I saw the performance of the Vietnamese military on
                    various levels that I witnessed. I'm not even sure that I ever saw a regular
                    Vietnamese army unit; they were always provincial and local troops and militia.
                    But they were more effective in their operations; the hamlets even after my
                    initial mental downgrading were more secure. The roads were better; the schools
                    were functioning better with more teachers so things seemed to be moving in the
                    right direction. But as I explained it, I think that some visiting American
                    senior officer on one occasion, I guess he had a question. He didn't ask what I
                    foresaw but he said how are they doing, and I said something to the effect well,
                    they're not doing as good a job as we would do, you know, my hubris—I never used
                    that word before—they're not doing as good a job as we would like them to do but
                    they are doing a better job, they are doing a job and they are making progress.
                    So the general took note of that. So that was about the way I saw it.</p>
                <p>So I was there in 1969 and 1970 so obviously that was before- no, that was after
                    Nixon's first election in '68 and of course he had a “plan” to get us out and I
                    suppose our withdrawals had begun. I'm sure they had; at least during my tour
                    they had begun.</p>
                <p>I've lost my train of thought.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well besides the military advisor team that you were kind
                        of a part of as a civilian in the district, the two different districts, was
                        there much other American combat forces there or military presence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: No, there were no American combat forces. I don't think the American
                    forces ever came through my province. Now, they may have been in the big
                    province across the Mekong River but never in my province.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because it was relatively secure, compared with some

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Relatively. It was reported to be the birthplace of the Vietcong but it
                    was relatively secure. There were no B-52 strikes. There was one lone bomb
                    crater on the outskirts of the province capital, which I laid eyes on on one
                    occasion. Apparently an Australian bomber had come over one evening and read the
                    map wrong and was off 100,000 meters or 10,000 meters, you know, the units that
                    the maps use, and they put the bomb in the wrong place. I don't think were any
                    casualties but this unhappy episode was immediately followed by a cornucopia of
                    compensation and aid from the province headquarters, the American province
                    headquarters to assuage hurt feelings and repair damages. But no, there were no
                    American troops.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>I mean, we did have, as I said, the American military personnel on our provincial
                    advisory team so when the local Vietnamese forces went on operations there'd be
                    a few Americans tagging along with them, if it was a big operation, with the
                    headquarters. Down at the district level, for instance, Americans, two or three,
                    might go out with one of the local Vietnamese units that was conducting an
                    ambush that night or conducting an operation of some sort that night. But there
                    were no American units coming through the province.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was also a period in the United States where there
                        was a lot of anti-war feeling and to some extent that's still with us today.
                        How much of that did you think about, talk about, remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well I was certainly aware of the fact that it was going on; it was going
                    on before I joined the State Department, before I got to Vietnam. One thing
                    that- Here is something that did impress me, I must say. I don't want to
                    overstate this but there were certainly members of our entering Foreign Service
                    class, I hesitate to say so many years later if it was everybody but me or a
                    majority or what, but certainly some members were so strongly against the U.S.
                    Government position in Vietnam I just found myself wondering why on earth they
                    wanted to work for the State Department, why on earth does the State Department
                    want them working for it if they can't wholeheartedly in good faith support what
                    is the major foreign affairs undertaking of their government and their country
                    at this time. So that was certainly food for thought. I don't think I myself
                    found the ongoing demonstrations, you know, what I would read in “Time” magazine
                    or “Stars and Stripes” especially upsetting. Maybe one reason was that I thought
                    the demonstrators were wrong and I thought the U.S. Government was right. But I
                    was certainly aware of it, no question about that, and I think it worried, to a
                    certain extent, the Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>And I was going to say a minute ago, I'll say it now, but I knew American troops
                    were withdrawing because I was getting a haircut at some barbershop on one of
                    the American military bases that I found myself visiting on one occasion for
                    some reason, and some man was cutting my hair but there was a pretty girl around
                    the shop, I forget if she was a barber or what have you, but I was in the
                    barber's chair and she came over and sort of leaned over, both her hands here on
                    my upper leg, looking up at me, and asked in Vietnamese, which I understood
                    perfectly well, questions about whether the United States would “throw away,”
                    that was the translation I had been taught for the word she was using, whether
                    the United States was going to throw away Vietnam. I did my best to reassure her
                    that would not be the case.</p>

                        Congress or people from Washington or mostly from in-country, they would
                        come around the district occasionally?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>PARKER: Certainly not all the time. I don't remember ever seeing anybody from
                    Congress. I remember William Colby coming through on one occasion and I spent
                    several hours talking with him until he fell asleep sitting on the sofa in the
                    house that I was living in at the time. I was there with him and my province
                    senior advisor and we were going back and forth; they had questions and I tried
                    to answer them. I don't blame the guy for falling asleep with the load he had to
                    carry. It was 9:00, 9:30 p.m., something like that, so it wasn't that late, but
                    he was tired so he fell asleep.</p>
                <p>And then a four star general came through, and I can't remember his name, I'm
                    surprised to say. I think this was after Westmoreland left and Abrams became the
                    top guy, maybe the visiting general was Abrams's deputy; I don't know. But he
                    was a four star general and he was a very astute guy, very concerned and
                    sensitive to local concerns and I was very happy to be assigned as his
                    interpreter for the occasion so I accompanied him for, I don't know, a number of
                    hours I guess, interpreted for him with village chiefs and local people and he
                    asked caring questions and insightful questions so I hope I understood and
                    interpreted correctly.</p>

                <p>PARKER: I would think so. I forget what I was tested for when I came back.
                    Whatever the test results might have shown I certainly believe I improved.</p>

                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>PARKER: Well there was one really memorable experience which I think shows what
                    the people were experiencing. This was in my second district so I was out with
                    my then-counterpart, the military man, the Vietnamese district chief, an army
                    captain, and it was the rainy season and we found ourselves in a building, it
                    must have been a community structure of some sort; it had thatched walls and
                    screen netting above that and then a tin roof; it was pouring rain so you could
                    hear the racket on the roof, and a lot of people from the hamlet had jammed into
                    this building. I'm sure they were summoned, come hear the district chief, and
                    the district chief was giving them a pep talk about, you know, you've got to
                    support the government and your militia has to be alert at night and take its
                    duties seriously and that's to protect the people and you've got to do this and
                    you're going to do that and we are doing this and rah, rah. And there was a
                    young Vietnamese woman with a baby on her hip and she responded and again, what
                    a blessing to have studied the language because I understood her perfectly, she
                    said, in Vietnamese, “Captain, you come in here in the daytime and you tell us
                    what you've just told us. The Vietcong come in here at night and tell us just
                    the opposite and they kill us. And what are we supposed to do?” And tears are
                    streaming down her cheeks and everybody around her was agreeing with her. So
                    that was very moving and I think illustrated how the people suffered, caught in
                    the middle.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well we had two R&amp;Rs; I used my R&amp;R's to go first to Thailand and
                    second to Australia. I probably went to Saigon half a dozen times during my 18
                    months. I went once because I had a very bad sore throat and I went to an
                    American military hospital; this nice young doctor treated me. I felt so guilty
                    for even being there, knowing who all the other patients were, the wounded
                    soldiers. But I infrequently went to Saigon and I don't recall what took me
                    there except to transit there on my R&amp;Rs, perhaps. I had no reporting
                    requirement to the embassy and the embassy never checked on anyone because after
                    all I had been seconded first of all to USAID; USAID seconded me to the hybrid
                    organization CORDS, which was half USAID, half U.S. Army, if you don't recall.
                    So I was, it might have breached some written agreement for the embassy to talk
                    to me. I don't know. Anyway, no contact with the embassy.</p>

                        senior advisor and so on, did you write reports and if so, to whom?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>PARKER: I wrote a lot of reports to my Department of State- my Department of
                    State superior at the province level. He left maybe halfway through my
                    assignment and whether I kept doing it after he left I really don't recall. But
                    I just basically sat down at the end of the day and typed a page or two of an
                    account of what I had done during the day and send those on up to him and he
                    seemed to value them highly. What he did with them I have no earthly idea. I
                    think towards the end of my tour I was asked to write a report- there was an
                    initiative of some sort by the Americans, maybe a joint Vietnamese initiative, a
                    joint Vietnamese-American initiative, I don't know, but I was asked to assess my
                    district chief, this would be in the second district, for evidence of
                    corruption, both pro and con. So I came up with the best report I possibly could
                    and tried to be conscientious. I actually touched on a couple of things which,
                    you know, suggested maybe there was a little minor leakage here and there. I
                    don't even remember what it was; I mean, certainly nothing major. Well, I got,
                    just as I will get the transcript of this conversation in due course, I got to
                    look at my report in due course and even these mild references on the pro
                    corruption side had been taken out of the report. You know, they asked for both
                    sides and they asked for my report so I did the best I could but the negative
                    material came out. And I thought very highly of this young man, but nevertheless
                    the assignment was to assess everything; there were a couple of little things
                    which might have suggested something slightly out of order so I touched on
                    those, but that didn't survive.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: It was a lovely country. I was always fascinated by the sky, and the
                    clouds, especially during the rainy season. The colors in the rice paddies, the
                    different varieties of rice, different times of year, different stages of the
                    growth of the rice crop were just fascinating. I lugged a camera around with me
                    essentially every waking moment in Vietnam and came back with 4,000 color
                    slides, so I had fun taking pictures. And I guess that is illustrative of the
                    fact that I was very lucky to be serving as a civilian advisor in a relatively
                    peaceful province, so with just some care as to where I was and what I was doing
                    I had the luxury of being able to take a lot of pictures.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: I have the vague impression that occasionally agricultural attach�s or
                    experts from the embassy or from USAID would at least come through the province.
                    I'm not sure that I ever laid eyes on them but they were interested, certainly,
                    in the agricultural side of things. So far as the economy goes, I'm thinking
                    there was a report of some sort, which wasn't my responsibility but somebody was
                    working on it, probably at the province level and since I was at the district
                    level I wouldn't have been involved.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well I had what was ostensibly the full course although stretched out
                    over several years. I had six months in Washington at FSI, went out to the
                    embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Tokyo.</hi>

                <p>PARKER: In Tokyo, at the embassy. And then, after maybe two years of early
                    morning classes, after about two years at the embassy I was chosen to continue
                    Japanese language training so I went down to Yokohama, to the language school
                    there for one more year. So one and a half years full time and two years of
                    morning classes, at the end of which I got, I guess a three/three, maybe a three
                    plus/three plus. I could read the preeminent Japanese economic newspaper, which
                    is the way I started my day, every day, and could speak pretty well. I don't
                    think I spoke Japanese as well as I spoke Vietnamese. The spoken language was
                    tough; it's a lot more complicated than Vietnamese. Of course the written
                    language is-</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Different levels of scores.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, out in the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. So what was your job in the embassy in Tokyo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well when I first went out I was assigned to work for the little, the
                    small group of people working on the Okinawa reversion negotiations, so that was
                    fascinating, that was really exciting as a first embassy assignment because
                    those negotiations were in the last three or four or five months of what had
                    been a process of several years. The DCM (deputy chief of mission) was running
                    the negotiations at the embassy and that was Dick Snyder. The ambassador, Armin
                    Meyer, really held himself above that particular fray and would occasionally
                    weigh in but Snyder ran that enterprise. Chuck Schmitz was the top working level
                    guy, Charles Schmitz.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: And there was a second man, Dalton Killian, who unfortunately died a
                    number of years ago, and finally myself. Well I was the low man on the totem
                    pole so I did what I was told to do. But the- I always thought we had an
                    advantage over the Japanese in terms of physical stamina and mental alertness
                    because we would work hard with our Japanese counterparts, obviously on Tokyo
                    time, all day long, and come back to the embassy and send along whatever they
                    were called in those days; not e-mails but telegrams, back to Washington and
                    then we'd go home, go to a party, go to bed, awake refreshed and get to the
                    office, and new instructions would have come out overnight from Washington.
                    Well, during that same nighttime all of our Japanese counterparts would have
                    been working who knows how long into the night because they did not have the
                    luxury of a second team, you know, half a day and many time zones away.
                    Certainly towards the end I think it was evident just how tired they were, much
                    more so than we were.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>But the negotiations progressed. They were- you know, it's been a long time, I
                    don't even remember all the issues. Certainly the extent to which we could
                    maintain our military facilities on Okinawa, a major issue, and they wanted to
                    squeeze us out of as many facilities as they could, thinking there was probably
                    a lot of redundancy and duplication and just unnecessary cases of the American
                    armed forces occupying Japanese territory. I guess our starting position was
                    that every facility was absolutely indispensable. Anyway, that involved a lot of
                    negotiating, whittling down the number of facilities to remain and defending the
                    existence of those that were to remain. That's a big issue.</p>
                <p>The Voice of America had a transmitter on Okinawa which was aimed not at Japan
                    but at China probably, Southeast Asia, so it was very important to us to keep
                    that transmitter operating. The Japanese sort of thought that would be an
                    infringement on their sovereignty so that involved some hard negotiating but as
                    I recall we negotiated I think a five year extension with the possibility of
                    renewal but no guarantee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To what extent was the Defense Department or any other
                        agencies involved in these reversion- Okinawa reversion negotiations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Oh they were very much involved. I mean, I can't speak for the Washington
                    end of things but in the embassy we had a military office with, I believe, a
                    three star admiral heading it up and at least one lieutenant colonel from each
                    of the armed forces. So that was the embassy military presence just working on
                    the Okinawa negotiations; there were probably others dealing with the ongoing
                    status of forces concerns under the security treaty that we had with the
                    Japanese. So there was definitely a military presence that was very much
                    involved in the negotiations. I mean they of course would be concerned with
                    retaining their facilities on Okinawa; they'd be less concerned, I suppose, with
                    Voice of America.</p>
                <p>Another touchy issue involved the little American business community on Okinawa,
                    a small group of people whose job really was- whose livelihood was really
                    servicing the Americans on Okinawa and the Japanese felt that once reversion
                    took place then all the normal Japanese laws and regulations should apply and
                    the American fear was that this would put most of them out of business and so we
                    worked long and hard on behalf of a rather small American business community on
                    Okinawa; I think pretty good results which would basically grandfather the
                    people who were there and then over time Japanese law would become fully
                    effective but those people were protected for the short term.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Other impressions, I mean, impressions of a young Foreign Service officer,
                    certainly the night of the signing ceremony was memorable. This still was in the
                    early years of the computer era but one way or another we arranged to have
                    simultaneous ceremonies in Tokyo and Washington with some sort of electronic
                    hook up and big TV screens at both ends so both sides could speak and observe,
                    see what was going on, all highly scripted, of course. And this treaty, even
                    though Japan was getting Okinawa back, was not popular, at least among the left
                    part of the Japanese political spectrum so there were big protests in the
                    streets, there were rock throwings, and the Japanese had some pretty vigorous
                    demonstrations in the old days; I don't know if they still do this or not, they
                    certainly did then. And so the riot police were out in force and the streets had
                    been cleared and we all piled into our limos and went over to wherever we went,
                    some suitable building for the occasion, and I could smell the tear gas wafting
                    through the streets. But it was very impressive with every Japanese official
                    from the prime minister, the cabinet, lots of very senior Japanese officials as
                    well as the working level officials who had worked on the negotiations. And on
                    the American side everybody from the ambassador down to the lowliest second
                    secretary who I guess was me, so that was very nice, a very nice ceremony and
                    the Japanese were very appreciative, obviously, of what we were doing.</p>

                        great threat. It was really the mass of people and the noise and all of
                        that. You know, there would certainly be people on the fringes who would
                        cause trouble but generally probably the best organized and behaved

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: No. I guess I could have read them, probably did at some point but no, I
                    didn't do the checking. We had- If it was done in the embassy it would have been
                    done by James Wickel, who was our very best interpreter in those days who was an
                    older guy by a number of years ago but he did all the interpreting between
                    American presidents and Japanese prime ministers. He was old enough, I think, to
                    have gotten his start during the Second World War and just kept it up. Did you
                    know Wickel?</p>

                <p>PARKER: It rings a faint bell.</p>

                <p>Okay. So, this was the first what, six months or so that you were in the embassy
                    in Tokyo?</p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. I think the agreement was signed the 31st of May.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well during the negotiations no; he just headed up this little office of
                    Okinawa negotiations but then probably that summer, since the negotiations were
                    done, he became political-military counselor, replacing a man, another FSO named
                    Howard Meyers; I don't know if you knew Howard. So Howard left and Chuck became
                    political-military counselor.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what happened to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Oh, I was assigned to the economics section and did some follow up work
                    for Chuck Schmitz on Okinawa matters. So what did I do in the economics section?
                    I probably did have some commercial responsibilities; I think this was before
                    the FCS was formed.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well I had chosen economic cone as my cone, as we were given the choice
                    when we entered State, so I was economics. Yes, certainly early on just
                    reporting. Gosh, this is embarrassing. I mean, I do remember helping American
                    businessmen from time to time but there was one issue in which I was thought to
                    have gained a little expertise. The Japanese, perhaps you remember, were
                    notorious for their allegedly complex, impenetrable and expensive distribution
                    system. Remember that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>PARKER: So I had been assigned to write a report on that so I came up with
                    something which might have been some value and there were some useful Japanese
                    experts on the subject who obviously helped me tremendously. So that's one thing
                    I worked on and I do remember talking to some businessmen about that subject.
                    What it may have accomplished I don't know.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of the economic commercial section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well let's see; at the very first Les Edmond was economic minister and
                    Peter, I forget how you pronounce the name, Lande, was the counselor; Larry
                    Dutton was in the section at the time and presently Les Edmond left and Bill
                    Colbert came in as minister and Lande left and Mike Calingaert came in as
                    counselor. So those were the people I worked for.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Economic cone of the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Meyer left as ambassador then I believe Ambassador Hodgson, I forget his
                    first name, and not surprisingly influential in Republican circles. But he had
                    been a cabinet officer; he had been secretary of labor, I believe, came out as
                    ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Dick Snyder left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Dick Snyder left in due course and Tom Shoesmith took his place as DCM.
                    So the days before language school were really very fuzzy as far as what I did,
                    other than Okinawa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went to Yokohama for the, let's call it advanced
                        Japanese language training, did you move to Yokohama or did you commute from
                        Tokyo?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>PARKER: Not to Yokohama; we moved to the town of Kamakura, which is a little
                    further south of Yokohama. We, my wife and I, found a very nice house that
                    belonged to some Japanese diplomat who was out of the country. I mean, not
                    opulent by any means but it was nice, quite nice; convenient to the bus line
                    which took us to the subway station which is how we got back and forth to
                    language school. And during that year, I'm happy to say, we continued to be
                    invited to a modest number of embassy gatherings so- which was important to us
                    because there we were in the middle of the Japanese countryside, which presented
                    great opportunities to learn the language but still we missed our colleagues and
                    friends at the embassy so we'd go out to Tokyo maybe once a week some evening to
                    a party and ride the last train back to Kamakura late in the evening. That was
                    always an experience because all the Japanese salary-men had been drinking their
                    evenings away and poured onto these trains. Oh lord! The trains would just reek
                    of alcohol and sometimes vomit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The last three months or so of my assignment to Japan,
                        this would have been 1961, I was assigned to the consulate in Yokohama but I
                        continued to live in Tokyo and commuted back and forth each day. At the time
                        that you were in language school, which would have been 1972?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, I think probably summer of 1972 to summer of 1973.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there still a consulate in Yokohama or had that closed
                        by then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: I believe it was still there. I can't swear to it but I believe it was
                    still there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the language school was up on the hill-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: -overlooking the port?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: I don't think we overlooked the port any longer. I believe the language
                    school had moved a couple of times. When we first arrived it was in, I believe
                    the U.S. Army housing complex called Bayside Courts. Does that ring a bell? In
                    any event they did acquire a new, large home on top of a hill somewhere in
                    Yokohama so we moved to that facility pretty early during our year at the
                    language school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And about roughly how large was the language school; about
                        what, 15 or so students? Twenty maybe?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, I'd say 20, maybe. There were a few wives, including my own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your wife, her Japanese was at a certain level when
                        she started?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. I mean, she did not get the six months in Washington that I got. She
                    was actually an FSIO; we met in our A-100 course; that's how we met. So she was
                    in Yugoslavia when I was in Vietnam and we came back to Washington at about the
                    same time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And got married at that point or had been married?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: We got married about three weeks before going to Japan. So once we got to
                    Japan we both started morning language classes; we were not in the same class
                    because she was a beginner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And was- did she need to resign when you got married?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Oh, yes. Somebody needed to resign so of course it went without saying
                    who would.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But she was able to do the early morning beginning classes
                        in Tokyo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then was able to pick up at her level in
                        Yokohama?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. So that was good. So she became quite proficient. I mean, she really
                    had a different vocabulary, oriented towards her needs and her life than I did
                    but that's okay; we complimented each other. It worked out very well.</p>
                <p>But anyway, at FSI in Yokohama, the language school where we had advanced- thank
                    you for bringing that term back to mind- the advanced language training, in
                    addition to American wives there were some third country students. There was at
                    least one New Zealand couple and one Englishman and one Canadian; you know, at
                    least those that I happen to remember right this minute. So there were probably
                    20 students in all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any military? Or was it all civilian?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>PARKER: All civilian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that was a year or roughly a year, 10 months, nine
                        months; what happened after that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, home leave and then back to the economic section for sure. By this
                    time probably or at least some time during the three years after language school
                    that I was in Japan the embassy moved out of that beautiful old building into
                    its temporary structure. And by the way, did you get some language training
                    yourself?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Only part time early morning classes, yes, in the
                        embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well you probably remember one of the initial dialogues, maybe the
                    initial sentence to which students are exposed, “Kore wan an deska?”, you know,
                    “What is this?” This is a book. What is this? This is a post office. Anyway, I
                    remember on one occasion late Sunday evening for some reason my wife, probably
                    my wife and I, I don't remember, but I was standing in front of the old American
                    embassy and there were a couple of Japanese men there and I just heard one say
                    to the other, I'll tell you, he spoke in Japanese but I will tell you what he
                    said in English; he said “Oh, this is the American embassy, is it?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in fact it wasn't by then. Or-?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: I think we were still in it; just on the verge of moving out before it
                    was demolished.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And where- So that- the old building was demolished while
                        you were there, and where was the temporary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Sort of up the hill behind it and just a plain rectangular three story
                    building, very simple, very bare bone, small offices.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But on that compound or the ambassador's residence, the
                        old chancery?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Probably the far side of the ambassador's residence. As I recall we were
                    across the street if not from the Okura Hotel itself at least from that hotel's
                    compound. It had more property than the hotel itself occupied. So we were in the
                    immediate vicinity; I think we were on the far side uphill of the ambassador's
                    residence and were there for a couple of years while the embassy was built.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And were you still there when the new embassy was occupied
                        or used? Or had you gone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: No, I think we must have left before then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And in terms of your work in that period you were doing
                        sort of reporting, same kind of thing, or-?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, reporting, a little bit of negotiating. We had an agreement with
                    Japan stemming from the Second World War; what was this one called? An agreement
                    between Japan and the United States of America concerning the trust territories
                    of the Pacific islands, a lot of those islands that were fought over in the
                    Second World War, some, maybe all of which, I don't remember, had been given to
                    Japan as trusteeships after the First World War. Anyway, we took them in the
                    Second World War and we negotiated somehow with the Japanese an agreement under
                    which they were paying claims of civilians arising out of the occupation and the
                    fighting, something. So I was in charge of that little agreement which had a
                    very small amount of money, I think a few million dollars, and the way it worked
                    was this amount of money could be used for not to pay individual claims but for
                    procurement by the trust territory government of mutually agreed items. So I
                    did, I supervised that. But I don't know if I really did any negotiating or not;
                    I did a little representation to the foreign office regarding aid to Egypt
                    following the 1973 Arab-Israeli conflict. But basically it was mostly reporting,
                    I guess. I'm just drawing a blank right this minute but my area of
                    responsibility was Japan's economic relations with developing countries. So
                    that's pretty broad but- so we were interested in Egypt, for instance, or the
                    relations with the Middle East, economic relations, I'm sorry.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And in those days, the early 1970s, Japan was taking on an
                        increasing burden, responsibility in terms of an aid program for developing
                        countries-</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: -in Africa and elsewhere.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: So I paid attention to that. I mean, of course Africa, Southeast Asia, of
                    course, so I paid attention to that. Occasionally there would be issues and I
                    used to talk to them occasionally about aid to Cambodia. I mean, along with us
                    they were providing aid to the Cambodian government so I would discuss that with
                    them, information to be exchanged, questions posed and answered.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were your main interlocutors, the main people you had
                        contact with about these various issues the foreign ministry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. Not exclusively but primarily. I mean, I knew a few people in the
                    Ministry of International Trade and Industry, MITI, or their environmental- do
                    they call theirs the environmental protection agency? In any event there was
                    some issue involving maybe emissions standards and how to measure emissions,
                    pollutants, I discussed once or twice or half a dozen times. Again, you know,
                    not negotiations really, just discussions and exchanges of information.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me back up for a second; you at some point declared
                        your interest in being an economic cone Foreign Service officer. You,
                        college your major was English literature, minor in history. You'd worked
                        for a bank; what sort of economic training- you've had wonderful language
                        training in your, what, five year Foreign Service career at this point,
                        roughly; Vietnamese and Japanese. To what extent did you have economic
                        training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: I had nothing in college, absolutely nothing in college but my first job
                    out of college was with the telephone company in Charlotte, North Carolina, and
                    I used to walk around during my lunch hour, and as it happened there was a
                    branch of the Federal Reserve right down the street, and in those days they
                    actually had sitting out on the street, well the sidewalk, a tract rack full of
                    all these nice publications by the Fed about the economy and monetary affairs
                    and financial affairs, just free for the asking, so I started picking those
                    things up and reading those so that's how I began to learn something and began
                    to develop an interest and so that's why I expressed the interest in the
                    economic cone when I signed up. So other than on the job in Tokyo and of course
                    I could read, I could write, I could add, so those skills all served me in good
                    stead but at that point it was just paying attention to what I read and what I
                    heard and trying to be careful and accurate. So after Japan, which was the
                    summer of 1976, my next assignment was the FSI economics course so I did that
                    and then several years later I was assigned to, dare I say it, advanced economic
                    training. I don't know if that phrase is used or not.</p>

                <p>PARKER: University economic training; went up to the University of Michigan for a

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well you must have done well in the economic
                        commercial section in Tokyo but that's certainly, you know, in that period
                        or probably today as well that was one of the most important embassies in
                        that field in the world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, yes. I'm sure that was the case. Well trade and in particular
                    Japanese exports and our trade deficit and sensitive items in international
                    trade such as textiles from the southern United States, those were all big
                    issues and so a lot of attention was paid to quotas or threats of quotas or
                    voluntary restraints on Japanese exports to the United States. But that would
                    have been done by the minister and/or the counselor and not somebody at my
                    level. And also exchange rates were of great interest. I mean, in the beginning
                    we had the post-war 360 to one exchange rate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I well remember that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, yes, the good old days which finally gave way and the yen began to
                    float, I forget, 1973, 1974, 1975, something like that. So that was an intense
                    interest but Treasury had its attach� and an assistant attach� and occasionally
                    even higher level visitors would come through. Paul Volker came through; what
                    was he at the time? He was a senior Treasury guy at one point, wasn't he?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes. He was undersecretary for international policy or
                        something in the early '70s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Probably in that capacity he came through. So not only did I not work on
                    that issue but State Department people didn't work on that issue either. They
                    might have kibitzed a little bit around the edges but I'm sure Treasury guarded
                    its prerogatives very carefully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the period 1970, '71, maybe '72, I was in the embassy
                        in Rome working as a financial economist, reporting to the Treasury attach�,
                        part of the economic section. Was there a State Department counterpart in
                        Tokyo in those days in the Treasury attach�'s office, do you remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: I don't think so. I mean, maybe there was and I don't remember but I
                    don't think so. I mean, there was the attach� and his assistant, who was another
                    Treasury guy.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well in Rome we had- Treasury Department had a Treasury
                        attach� and assistant attach� also from the Treasury Department and I was
                        the third wheel, third officer in that office and did a lot of the
                        financial- the macroeconomic reporting under their direction,
                        supervision.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Who was the economic minister during this period? Was Bill Colbert still there or
                    most of the time?</p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, I think he was there until I came home. I think just Les Edmond to
                    begin with and Bill Colbert afterwards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then who did you say replaced Peter Lande?</hi>

                <p>PARKER: Mike Calingaert.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mike Calingaert, yes. Well, all very strong, as I said
                        before, economic officers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well one would hope that Tokyo would get that kind of person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. Although, you know, it sounded like, from my
                        understanding and recollection that you had by far the strongest language
                        skills in that section probably, Japanese language.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well none of the four people I've mentioned had language skills. I mean,
                    some of the other working level people had them. I mean, my contemporaries
                    included, for instance, Don Westmore, who was an excellent language officer;
                    Bill Breer, was a little ahead of me in Japan though we did overlap. We had some
                    time in Japan together and he was superb at Japanese. One of my contemporaries
                    was Ira Wolfe; I forget if he got he advanced training or not, perfectly
                    honestly.</p>
                <p>Could we take a five minute break?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure. Let's stop for five minutes or whatever.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Okay. Well, we're coming, I think Tom, to the end of our discussion of your time
                    in the embassy in Tokyo. Is there anything else you want to say about your- that
                    period of your career?</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>PARKER: Well I guess nothing immediately occur to me. I mean, obviously it was a
                    wonderful experience, both Vietnam, believe it or not, the war going on, and
                    Japan, wonderful experiences. Japan was different from the first perspective and
                    also because I was now married and since, as I said, we were married three weeks
                    before going out there, we always considered Japan to be our five year long
                    honeymoon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were there for about five years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, about five and a half, yes. But I did work hard, I stayed busy. I
                    don't know that I've described any traumatic happenings to you; survived an
                    earthquake or two, which always gets your attention. I think it was early in our
                    stay in Japan that we had the first oil crisis; that was late 1973, as I recall.
                    It wasn't that I was brand new in Japan when that happened, but the irony that I
                    recall was that just months before the first oil crisis the Japanese had closed
                    maybe their last coal mine, which is on an island way up north somewhere. It was
                    actually featured in a TV program within the last three or four months; I
                    happened to see it, which made it refresh my memory enough to remember it this
                    morning. But how ironic to have shut down their last coal mine just literally
                    months before the price of oil quadrupled or did whatever it did.</p>
                <p>Oh, one very pleasant thing I will say about Japan at about that time, after the
                    first oil crisis, was that the Japanese in very short order introduced car-free
                    Sundays so we could just walk around Tokyo to our heart's content and not
                    breathe the fumes or fear getting run over or be deafened by the noise. Those
                    were delightful; we kept waiting for the United States to introduce car-free
                    Sundays but we never did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You lived in the period after language training in
                        Yokohama; you lived in what, an apartment in the embassy housing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, after language training we came back to the embassy compound and I
                    think at the time there were three buildings, Perry House, Harris House and Grew
                    House and in their turn we lived in all three. Our first daughter was born in
                    Japan; that was exciting but not especially professionally relevant,
                    perhaps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is certainly important to you and your wife and to your
                        daughter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, indeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Did you travel around Japan a lot or not really all
                        that much?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>PARKER: Not as much as we should have and I regret that. We had what seemed like
                    a good excuse at the time. You also probably know the name John Emerson, a
                    distinguished American diplomat who finished his career as DCM in Tokyo. It was
                    felt that his career was stunted or retarded because he had been, I don't know,
                    peripherally connected with the China hands during the Second World War and
                    although I think he himself escaped any serious blame or accusations,
                    nevertheless a little something sort of rubbed off and it was thought that that
                    kept him from being ambassador or going further than he did. Nevertheless, the
                    point is he had a very nice rental house in Nikko. Did you ever visit this
                    place, Akamon in Nikko? Anyway, in our day there'd be a group of embassy people
                    who were in charge of the place, we paid the expenses nine months out of the
                    year and he and his wife would always come for late summer and fall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was retired at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: He was retired by that time. So since we had the use of this wonderful
                    house a couple of hours by train from Tokyo we spent many weekends up there and
                    loved every one of them, but that kept us from traveling elsewhere as much as we
                    otherwise might have so that was too bad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I remember Nikko very well but I don't remember that
                        house or that property.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: It's very close to the big temple complex and to the red Sacred Bridge
                    that crosses the river there, the Shinkyo, if you remember that, the
                    Shinkyo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I think with the consulates, I guess in those days,
                        in Sapporo and Kobe Osaka and Fukuoka.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't remember a lot of encouragement to embassy people
                        to travel, at least in my period officially. I mean, when we would- I was
                        single at the time and would go skiing and you know, do other travel but not
                        so much for professional reasons.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. Well I guess I'll have to say I never felt pushed to travel because
                    if I had felt pushed I probably would have done it. Took a couple of trips under
                    the auspices of the language school; they wanted us to do that as part of our
                    training. It was required to go off somewhere and speak the language for a week.
                    So I did that.</p>

                        course, which was, I believe perceived to be the equivalent of an
                        undergraduate major in economics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. That's what was said and I certainly believe it. There were a lot of
                    courses; I worked harder in that course than I had worked in college and I
                    thought Davidson was a pretty good and pretty demanding college so I don't think
                    people were loafing. And I felt that I learned a tremendous amount and a lot of
                    it stood me in good stead later on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go after that course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Let's see; right after that I stayed in Washington, went to the Economic
                    Bureau to the Office of Development Finance, ODF, which for the State Department
                    followed the Export/Import Bank and the World Bank and multilateral development
                    banks and there was a different office that followed the IMF (International
                    Monetary Fund). Very early in my service in that office I guess the Carter
                    Administration had come to power and he began the introduction of human rights
                    considerations into the loan processes of all the lending institutions. That was
                    not without controversy at the time but he was the president so he got his way,
                    of course. But several of my colleagues were very wrapped up in the human rights
                    business; I never was myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were involved with the World Bank and with
                        coordinating, I guess, with the geographic, the regional bureaus on issues
                        involving proposed loan programs to various countries.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, I did. Actually with the World Bank and that was certainly a big
                    part of the job, reading the loan documents every week and consulting with the
                    regional bureaus or country desks, coming to an agreed State Department
                    view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then how would the State- the agreed State Department
                        view be expressed? To the Treasury Department or-?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>PARKER: In the case of the- Well, there was always a process of interagency
                    discussion and consensus building going on and if there was something really
                    controversial about a particular project then you might have assistant
                    secretaries talking to each other, conceivably even more senior officials, but
                    most of the transactions were just addressed at the working level. Because our
                    general- State's general approach, which the Treasury generally consented to
                    maybe somewhat grudgingly, was to the effect that the loans provided by these
                    institutions — well, in the case of the Export/Import Bank in addition to being
                    good for American exporters — were good for the countries involved and therefore
                    they forwarded our foreign policy goals of development and therefore we ought to
                    be supportive, as a rule. And so certainly questions were raised from time to
                    time and as I said, there were controversies sometimes and occasionally we would
                    oppose a loan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say “we,” meaning the United States or we the
                        State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Okay, yes. It could be either or both. But if State objected this might
                    just be done in the interagency arena and we might get overruled or we might
                    prevail. In the case of the Export/Import Bank there was a weekly meeting at
                    Ex/Im and all the concerned agencies would show up, all the people that I
                    routinely interacted with during the week, so we pretty much knew each other's
                    positions ahead of time and actually, for every- at least for every
                    controversial loan, every agency representative would be polled, you know, I'm
                    in favor or I'm opposed, and I'm in favor because or I'm opposed because — so it
                    was that sort of dialogue that took place in these meetings. Now, if there was
                    great controversy the decision would probably be carried over until further, you
                    know, behind the scenes conversations and consensus building and coming to an
                    agreement. In the case of the World Bank, of course we had an executive director
                    who was responsible to Treasury so we would make our case in the interagency
                    context and Treasury would instruct the Executive Director. We in the Economic
                    Bureau rarely talked to the executive director.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Directly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Directly, yes, so we would make our case in the interagency context with
                    Treasury. So that seemed to work. So that was a big part of the job, the
                    individual loan transactions and then the other big part of the job in the case
                    of the World Bank was that every so often there would be a capital replenishment
                    either for the International Development Association or the IBRD proper,
                    International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, proper, and those took up
                    a lot of time and negotiations and consensus building and consulting with
                    Congress because Congress had to appropriate the money. That could take months
                    and Congress would want to attach conditions or wouldn't want to provide all the
                    money or provide it only in a niggardly way over several appropriations cycles.
                    But that was a big part of the job as well.</p>

                        Turkey, other countries but also various multilateral institutions. Is that

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well I tried to read the loan documents, which typically would have a lot
                    of information about the economic situation of the country. I myself, I don't

                    know; if I was writing a memo about some loan maybe there'd be a sentence or two
                    about the economy but no more than that.</p>

                    did the nuts and bolts with working with Congress on bank issues. I did write
                    testimony on several occasions; I wrote testimony for Richard Cooper, as I

                    he came back to EB as whatever he was at the time but he was certainly around. I

                </p>
                <p>Okay. This is an oral history interview with Thomas Parker, Jr., and it's the
                    13th of July, 2009. Tom, I'd like to ask you just a question about the hamlet
                    evaluation system when you were with CORDS in South Vietnam, 1969-1970. You
                    indicated, I believe, that the initial factors, initial determination that you
                    made of the hamlets, the villages in your district was judged to be a little too
                    strict, a little too- lower, perhaps had been expected or had been determined
                    before and you were asked or they were raised a bit. And I guess my question is,
                    was that, do you recall- I don't need to go into details but do you recall that
                    that reinterpretation or that was done sort of locally by your boss, your
                    supervisor or was it something in response to a directive from Saigon or
                    Washington? You know, this was pretty late in the Vietnam War that you were
                    there and presumably this kind of thing had been going on for some time.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>PARKER: Well, I'll be happy to talk a little bit more about that. I suppose we
                    had been introduced to the hamlet evaluation system in our training back in
                    Washington, D.C. I don't have a clear recollection on that point but it would
                    stand to reason that if we were having a rather focused, not even area studies
                    but let's say focused area studies concentrating on Vietnam, the soon-to-be
                    country of assignment it would certainly make sense to be introduced to the
                    system which we used to measure our progress in the countryside and the
                    classification effort. Be that as it may, whether I was introduced to it in
                    Washington or not or to what extent, once I got out to my district I knew that I
                    had a certain number of hamlets in this first district and they were all rated
                    according to the hamlet evaluation system and so it was important that I become
                    familiar with the system and so at least no later than that point in time took a
                    careful look and it wasn't an especially complicated system. I don't recall the
                    number of questions for each hamlet, probably no more than 20, maybe fewer, so
                    it was not overly burdensome or, you know, what's the word, gratuitously
                    detailed, wasn't so detailed that the questions were meaningless. The questions
                    were pretty good questions. But the point in my mind was that some of the
                    questions were based on absolutely objective facts; is there a road to the
                    village or not? I think that's objective. Maybe you could have argued whether
                    this was a road or was just a trail of some sort. But I think there were some
                    questions that were quite objective in that respect and others that were more
                    subjective and required more thought or analysis or coming to a conclusion. I
                    think a requirement came out from the province to review all of our assessments
                    and update them and send them, whether this was a quarterly exercise or
                    semi-annual, I don't really remember, but I think the requirement came from
                    province headquarters to review all the ratings and send them in.</p>
                <p>So I started looking at the questions and looking at the hamlets and by this
                    point in time I had a passing familiarity with the district and I think I had
                    been to all the hamlets and in some cases it was easy to look at the objective
                    questions and say yes, there is a road or no, there is not a road; yes, there is
                    a school, no, there is not; yes, there's a teacher or no, there's not. And in
                    others it was more difficult. And here my memory is somewhat failing me but I'm
                    sure there were questions having to do with security and maybe what's your, Mr.
                    Advisor, what's your assessment of the security in this hamlet based on does the
                    hamlet chief sleep there, things of that sort. So I just went through the
                    questions, being as objective and factual and accurate as I could; I wanted to
                    send in accurate information. But the result of this was that a good many of the
                    hamlets were downgraded, I'm not sure to- as I recall there was a letter grading
                    system from A to E, probably.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No Fs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: No Fs, although E was probably pretty bad. But, actually speaking of the
                    hamlet chief sleeping in the hamlet, if the hamlet chief didn't sleep in the
                    hamlet, and that was a fact that you could objectively determine by talking to
                    the hamlet chief, that told you something about the security situation in the
                    hamlet.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>In any event, I went through the questions and addressed each question as
                    carefully and objectively as I could and the results were lower grades for a lot
                    of the hamlets. Now, if a hamlet went from A to B, I mean B was still pretty
                    good in this system; even a C wasn't that bad. But anything less than an A was
                    not as good as an A and if 15 hamlets suddenly were downgraded a letter grade
                    that was cause for concern, all the more so because Go-Cong was looked at as one
                    of the most successful provinces in its pacification effort and there were all
                    these hamlets, all these wonderful ratings and good things were happening,
                    that's a fact. The fighting was very subdued by the time I was there.</p>
                <p>So far as I know the only reaction to this reevaluation that I sent in was from
                    the province level. And in retrospect it would have well behooved me, even
                    before I started assessing the hamlets, probably to have had a conversation or
                    two with somebody at the province, get a feel for the terrain and better
                    understanding the situation. Certainly it would have behooved me if I
                    tentatively came to the conclusion that a lot of the hamlets were overrated to
                    talk to somebody at the province level before sending in this report. So that
                    was, in retrospect, a deficiency in my performance.</p>
                <p>In any event the word came back that this just wasn't acceptable. Now, if time
                    goes by and month to month or quarter to quarter you want to downgrade one or
                    two hamlets, well that would be okay, but you just can't have this wholesale
                    reevaluation in a downward direction out of a clear blue sky, so to speak, let
                    alone this particular province with this sterling record of performance. So I
                    revised the report or maybe it was revised for me, I don't remember, but the
                    final product had the better grades than I had initially assigned. Well, so far
                    as I knew there were never any repercussions directed at me; I wasn't punished
                    or reassigned or otherwise disciplined but I did take note of that and I gave
                    you my feelings on that the other day, to the effect that, in retrospect it was
                    a little impolitic to propose this across the board downgrading but I still felt
                    that it was essential to provide the best information that I possibly could
                    because people further up the chain of command were relying on that to make
                    their decisions and plot their course and formulate policy. So I think the
                    underlying rationale was a good one but I probably wasn't as astute in the
                    implementation of my evaluations as I should have been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you one other question, which you may not be
                        able to answer. Do you have the sense that it was kind of your
                        interpretation, recognizing that this was largely subjective, at least the
                        part where you could, you know, you might have a different opinion than
                        whoever had done it before, or was it possibly that the situation had
                        changed since it had been done previously?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>PARKER: I don't think the situation had changed. I mean, Go Cong was relatively a
                    very peaceful province by 1969. I just think that one way or another— Well,
                    somebody was a lot more lenient than I was. I don't want to spite anyone else or
                    criticize, not knowing the previous person's rationale, but whether it was just
                    being sort of swept up in the good feelings about the province as a whole, the
                    absence of fighting on a significant basis, a large scale basis, that's
                    something that's kind of like it was just zapped. You know, for heaven's sakes,
                    well we've been warned of “irrational exuberance” in another context and you
                    know, the herd mentality develops and they want to go with the flow so these
                    things happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well why don't we leave it at that unless you have
                        anything else to say.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: No. If you would be interested I had two more anecdotes occur to me that
                    shed a little bit of light on my experience on a district team in South
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: The first had to do with food coming down the American supply chain from
                    what its original source may have been, I'm not sure, down to the province and
                    then out to the districts. By the time the supply chain reached the districts
                    the food coming out the end seemed to be fairly limited in quantity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Quantity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Quantity; never complained about the quality. But often our larder would
                    be bare, so to speak. I don't think we were at risk of starving to death; we'd
                    just walk into town and get a bowl of soup or something but nevertheless we took
                    note of the fact that there wasn't a lot of food coming through normal supply
                    channels. And I was chatting with a friend at the province level about this on
                    one occasion when that problem was confronting this particular district team and
                    he said “Gosh Tom, I don't know why you can have such a problem. I mean, there's
                    always plenty of food in the province level PX” — commissary, whatever it wa“so
                    far as I can see.” And this was a civilian advisor as I was and he lived in his
                    own house and apparently prepared a lot of his own meals. But the punch line is,
                    he said, “I went by the commissary and picked up a dozen steaks just the other
                    day.” Well, that was the problem; obviously, the people at the higher levels of
                    the supply chain were just getting everything they wanted and not leaving much
                    to dribble out at the bottom. So I think in due course I did have occasion to
                    report that to somebody else as well, probably at the very end of my tour. I
                    hope no heads rolled for it but I hope some improvements were made. So that was
                    just, hopefully, of some interest in this context.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>The other thing, although I was a civilian, as I told you I ended up as the
                    district senior advisor in my second district and we had a military advisory
                    team, MAT, MAT 29, as I recall, and they were very conscientious in training
                    local militia in military skills. But two of the guys, the lieutenant in charge
                    and one of his sergeants went out with a local unit one night to lay an ambush
                    using claymore mines, and they set up their mines very well and were lying in
                    wait and unfortunately they were attacked from a different direction, not from
                    their front but the side, the rear, and I think we found out later that they had
                    perhaps moved into their final position just a little bit early, it hadn't
                    gotten completely dark and so somebody saw them and tipped off the Vietcong, who
                    happened to be nearby that night. So anyway, these two guys were both killed,
                    unfortunately, so that was very traumatic. The first one died of a gunshot wound
                    to the chest so he couldn't leave and the lieutenant, his boss, stayed to defend
                    his comrade so he too was killed. The militia scattered to the winds but the
                    Americans held their ground. So I had the unpleasant duty the next day of going
                    out to look at the scene of the fight; a helicopter had come in the middle of
                    the night, taken away the bodies. And you could see, the good news was that the
                    claymore mines had done their job, they had detonated facing a Viet Cong line of
                    advance, and there were several large, separate blood stains on the ground from
                    VC soldiers killed by the mines, so we could see the claymore mines effective.
                    We could also see the blood and the brains of the American advisors. So that was
                    very traumatic. I did get the district chief, my counterpart who was
                    accompanying me on this expedition, to give the order to get a shovel somewhere,
                    you know, bury the brains so the dogs wouldn't eat them. I did that.</p>
                <p>Anyway, there's just a Foreign Service experience for you, in case that might be
                    interesting.</p>

                <p>Okay. Anything else you want to say about Vietnam? I know we talked at length
                    about it the other day.</p>
                <p>PARKER: Nothing else occurred to me. I mean, there were certainly many amusing
                    anecdotes but that's probably enough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well, why don't we move forward then to where we
                        were at the end of last session; I think you'd just finished talking about
                        your assignment to the office of development and finance in the economic
                        business bureau, and then you went next to the oceans and science bureau, to
                        the office of environmental research. What does that office do and what did
                        you do there? This was about 1979?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, that was 1979 to 1981, as I recall, so this was when the — this was
                    under President Carter and then under President Reagan, I suppose. Yes, I
                    remember in my office I had a “Washington Post” political cartoon depicting
                    Reagan's victory and as I recall he must have brought a lot of Republicans in on
                    his coattails because the cartoon depicted a mastodon labeled “GOP,” with a
                    caveman on top, trodding over some hapless Democrat who was saying something to
                    the effect, “an elephant is one thing but a mastodon is something else.” Anyway,
                    that puts it in the time frame.</p>
                <p>I don't recall everything the office did, perfectly honestly. We did concern
                    ourselves with endangered wildlife so I and at least one colleague worked on
                    that sort of issue and I believe under President Carter there was these periodic
                    sweeping of intellectual exercises going on to produce—to take a look at the
                    environment and what the future might hold. I think maybe it was called Global
                    2000; does that possibly ring a bell?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like it could be.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. So some of my colleagues worked on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you primarily worked on endangered wildlife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. I was responsible for several wildlife treaties; there was a treaty,
                    I forget its name, but it has to do with conservation and the Western
                    Hemisphere, our hemisphere, so this involves us and the Canadians and the
                    countries to our south. The most well known treaty is the “Washington
                    Convention” or the CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered
                    Species) convention, the convention on international trade in endangered species
                    of wild fauna and flora. Thirdly there was a treaty, with another long name,
                    “Convention on the Conservation of Wetlands of International Importance,
                    Especially as Waterfowl Habitat” (the “Ramsar Convention”), so I was involved
                    not so much on the Western Hemisphere treaty, nothing was going on under its
                    auspices but there was a lot going on under the Washington Convention, CITES and
                    the wetlands convention. And then finally, on top of that, we had been
                    discussing with the Canadians a proposed agreement of some sort, treaty,
                    executive agreement, something, international agreement, to protect the
                    porcupine caribou herd, which you may recall crossed back and forth over the
                    international boundary between Alaska and Canada twice a year in its migration
                    back and forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Porcupine caribou?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. I mean, it's a caribou herd but the name of the herd was Porcupine”.
                    I think there was a river named the Porcupine River so it was named for the
                    river. So for all three of these efforts there would be lots of interagency
                    coordination, discussion and debate and then there would be meetings. I think
                    CITES generally had a very large international meeting once a year, maybe once
                    every two years. As I recall we sent a- I don't want to mix up my treaties here-
                    yes, okay, so they met in New Delhi, India, that year, for two full weeks. I
                    mean, who knows what they talked about for two full weeks? One thing they would
                    talk about was whether to list an animal pursuant to this treaty's provisions
                    and if it was listed it would then be given certain levels of protection, and in
                    some cases that was relatively straightforward. There was a considerable
                    controversy one year, the year that I was there, because the environmentalists
                    felt that the International Whaling Commission was not being aggressive enough
                    in protecting whales and the whales should be brought under the purview of the
                    CITES convention and the more conservative folks, and I think this was the
                    United States' position, felt we had the International Whaling Commission with
                    the specific purpose of looking at the whale, let's let them do their jobs,
                    we'll worry about everything else in CITES. But actually the environmentalists
                    prevailed and that year the convention did take the decision to begin to pay
                    attention to whales as well.</p>
                <p>But I think generally speaking the meetings were workmanlike and there were lots
                    of scientists involved as well as the usual mix of bureaucrats and politicians.
                    And in fact, at the end of that meeting then-Congressman John Breaux held a
                    little hearing in his whatever House committee, subcommittee it probably was,
                    and there were two or three witnesses who had known they would be asked to
                    testify and lo and behold at the end he invited me to come by and say something.
                    So I did, just extemporaneously but he seemed pleased and didn't give me a hard
                    time, and I got a transcript of that in due course and showed it to one or two
                    of my superiors and they were happy so I was happy.</p>
                <p>So that was the Washington Convention. With the Wetlands Convention they were
                    very concerned about habitat loss, more so than listing critters. I mean, they
                    wanted to preserved wetlands so that was always their focus. I honestly don't
                    recall any especially controversial issues this given year; a nice meeting in
                    Sardinia, Italy and the reason we met in Sardinia was that there was a large
                    wetland of international importance there with a magnificent flock of flamingoes
                    so they were always flying around. I mean, my image of flamingoes was formed in
                    the southern United States, seeing the plastic or concrete replicas standing on
                    one leg in people's front yards. They are ungainly when they are in that
                    position but boy, when they take off they are just magnificent critters.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>The negotiation with the Canadians was the most problematic, not because we
                    couldn't get along with the Canadians, which we could, but because the Alaska
                    Congressional delegation was rather strongly opposed to any significant
                    international agreement on this topic, feeling that yet again the Feds were
                    usurping the rightful prerogative of the state to manage their wildlife as they
                    saw fit. So at least when I worked on the proposed agreement I had three
                    wonderful trips to Alaska to look at the territory and had one town hall meeting
                    all the way up in the Kaktovik; that was the name of the Eskimo village way up
                    on the North Slope so all the native people and a few non-native hangers on
                    showed up, talked about the issues. That was very interesting. But in any event,
                    unfortunately, because of the resistance of the Congressional delegation the
                    proposal when I worked on it, the effort did not prosper but just sort of ground
                    to a halt. But a year or two or three later it was resuscitated in a slightly
                    less ambitious form and some exchange of letters or executive agreement or
                    something less than a treaty was agreed to. And the primary objective would be
                    to take care of the habitat; again, just let the caribou have some place to
                    go.</p>

                <p>PARKER: The only State person but typically there'd be people from Department of
                    the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In our talks with the Canadians
                    we'd have a representative of a congressional office along with us, not a U.S.
                    Representative but a staff member.</p>
                <p>But going back to New Delhi, the biggest delegations, there would be Interior,
                    Fish and Wildlife Service. There'd be Agriculture because the treaty was for
                    fauna and flora. Probably other agencies were also there that now escape me
                    because one normally wouldn't think of them in the wildlife context but they did
                    have an interest.</p>

                    the issues very seriously.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>PARKER: Well one of the critters that I became involved with was the kangaroo
                    because in its wisdom the United States Government had listed, under our
                    endangered species act, at least one species of Australian kangaroo; that's the
                    only place they live, isn't it, except in zoos? In any event our government had
                    listed under our endangered species act one of the Australian kangaroo species
                    as either endangered- probably threatened, probably threatened, which is not as
                    serious as endangered, and this was to the considerable chagrin of the
                    Australians, first of all because it was their critter and their country;
                    secondly because in their opinion there were kangaroos all over the place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hardly threatened.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Exactly. In fact, there are so many of them that outback, where the
                    critters live, the people put these big heavy pipes, mount them on their cars in
                    front of their grills so that if there's a collision, the kangaroo and a car,
                    these pipes take the brunt of the collision and the radiator and the engine are
                    not damaged. And these bars, by the way, are called “roo bars”. So anyway, the
                    Australians were dissatisfied and the Americans then said well fine, if you want
                    to have them delisted according to the provisions of our law you must do A, B, C
                    and D, and so the Australians did A, B, C, and D-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Australians.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Sorry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this case.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Australians did A, B, C, and D and then by golly, I mean, this was done
                    at the working level but even so the Americans of the Department of the Interior
                    changed their position so now you've also got to do E and F. I had just begun
                    work in this office and became involved in the issue and started reading this
                    record, it was actually a court case of some sort, and at one point I had to
                    assemble a record of telegrams on the subject and produce a little statement
                    that I submitted to the court. But I remarked to my colleagues at the time that
                    had I been a benevolent dictator in charge of this affair, or the Secretary of
                    the Interior, or the Secretary of State, I would have had somebody fired for
                    that double crossing of the Australians. That was really a very poor show.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>So in any event the Australians sucked it up and were still doing their best to
                    meet the requirements of our law to get their critter delisted. That is a pretty
                    long digression, I'm sorry. So it was when I was working on that issue that a
                    woman, I believe from the Humane Society, and I believe her name was Marian
                    Newman and she was known around town as “the kangaroo lady”, she came to call on
                    me at the State Department to make a demarche, to make sure that I wouldn't sell
                    out these lovely creatures. So I tried to assure her that I would not “sell out
                    the lovely creatures.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like you had a very interesting but specialized
                        in distinctive responsibility which, and this is, I guess a question, to
                        what extent were you getting supervision, pressure, interest from higher
                        levels, either in your immediate office, the office of environment and
                        resources, or at the bureau level or beyond?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: There's not a lot of pressure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were pretty much on your own.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Pretty much. Now, the assistant secretary at the time was Tom Pickering
                    and I do remember discussing elephants with him on one occasion, I mean, just in
                    a casual way but nevertheless he indicated he knew something about elephants,
                    was interested in them and knew about CITES or whatever was going on that
                    prompted the conversation. So it's not that all of the superiors were totally
                    oblivious to these things but they probably felt that they had bigger fish to
                    fry, so to speak. And the deputy assistant secretary was Otty Haynes. He was
                    very much involved in the wildlife issues, he's very interested. He certainly
                    went to the Canadian negotiations; I don't believe he traveled to the other
                    meetings but he was very much involved so he would provide guidance. The
                    Department's legal advisor's office was certainly involved; they had an attorney
                    advisor to go with the delegation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that they had other fish to fry; that makes
                        me ask did you get involved with fish too, or is that by a different
                        office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: A different office. It's funny you should ask; I just happened to
                    remember, one Saturday morning I was in the, probably the bureau front office
                    for some reason and there was some flap dealing with fish, a pretty important
                    flap; strike flap and say crisis, with some significant problem and John
                    Negroponte was in the office, a much younger John Negroponte, this was the end
                    of the '70s, and he was on the phone to someone, talking about what was going to
                    be done with the fish. So, again, certain of these issues did get attention from
                    more senior people.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John Negroponte was the assistant secretary for OES in the

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, he must have been one of the deputies at the time.</p>
                <p>

                        '79 to '81?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: It was an enjoyable period, not stress free because as I said, there were
                    a lot of people who were intensely interested in these issues but if it wasn't
                    stress free I guess it was just a typical State Department job. But it was
                    certainly, I think, unusual for a State job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know one of the things I think- I found in my State
                        Department Washington jobs, particularly in, well, in my case the economic
                        bureau, it was that it was hard and took time to establish your credentials
                        with people from other agencies, maybe Congress, who had been working these
                        issues for a long period of time. Was that your experience in this
                        case?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well I think they accepted me, certainly, but they knew they had the
                    expertise and so the relationship was sometimes in some respects sort of that
                    between teacher and student. So we'd be having a conversation and they'd just be
                    explaining this is the way this is. I mean, I never got the feeling they
                    resented State's participation; I think State recognized they had the expertise
                    so we worked things out and got along. They understood the role of the State
                    Department in foreign affairs; we recognized their expertise.</p>

                <p>PARKER: I think we always went to Ottawa. When I went to Alaska this was just
                    with two or three other probably Interior Department people just to get the lay
                    of the land, to get the input from the local people, a better understanding of

                <p>PARKER: I went off to the University of Michigan to study economics for a year
                    under the State Department's auspices. I was an economic officer as I said
                    earlier; I was nevertheless advised that going off to Michigan to study
                    economics would probably not be a good thing for my career but I did it anyway
                    and who knows whether it was a good thing for my career. Obviously I didn't have
                    that long a career but I did feel for years afterwards, probably for as long as
                    I worked for State, that what I learned at Michigan had been extremely helpful
                    to me, both the economics — and most of it was economics, but I took one course
                    in the law school under a man who was the alleged American guru of international
                    trade at the time, John Jackson, in case you should have ever have heard his
                    name. And that, course was the law of international trade and economic
                    relations. I enjoyed the economics program and learned a lot and also thought
                    the law school course was invaluable. So, I thought Michigan was a very good
                    thing for me personally and strengthened my competence as an economic
                    officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well having done university economic training also myself,
                        I really thought it was a great year and a great experience. It went by very
                        quickly and I suspect that was your experience too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, too quickly, unfortunately.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. And what happened after that? In '82 at that
                        point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, I came back to Washington and went back to the economic bureau to
                    the office of special trade activities. I loved that acronym; that was a
                    euphemism; that was what we called our own protective — trade protective
                    measures under various American statutes, hopefully consistent with our
                    international obligations. But this office concerned itself with anti-dumping
                    and countervailing duty cases and then, I'm a little rusty on the terminology
                    but I think Section 201 had to do with escape clause procedures under our trade
                    legislation; Section 301, I don't know, special relief measures of some sorts. I
                    think, for instance, during this period of time we provided some limited import
                    relief to our manufacturers of specialty- of stainless steel, which is a
                    specialty steel, and I believe that occurred under the provisions of Section 301
                    of the Trade Act of 19— whatever year it was.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Trade Act of 1960? I don't know. Well, it doesn't matter.
                        Okay. So in that- you were the assistant chief of that, what? Office,
                        division?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: It was a division, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Part of the office of international trade, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Let's see. The section chief reported directly to Teresita “Tezi”
                    Schaeffer, who was the deputy assistant secretary for some part of trade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: I mean, I know there was a different office under Ralph Johnson at the
                    time; I think that was the office of international trade, so-called, but we were
                    not part of his office. Ralph also reported to Tezi Schaffer. We were a separate
                    section. I think that's right. Anyway, it's a long time ago; I'm sorry I'm very
                    vague on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the division chief, do you remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, Tom O'Herron. Did you know Tom?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. So you primarily were dealing with the International
                        Trade Commission, with the Office of the Special Trade Representative,
                        STR.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. Department of Commerce; Commerce played the role not in the
                    specialty steel proceeding I just mentioned but in negotiating with the European
                    Union “voluntary restraints” on the export of steel and steel products to the
                    U.S. Commerce took the lead on that particular issue. So it was fascinating and
                    I must say, as far as the economic assignments went I enjoyed this, dealing with
                    international trade more than any of the others. You got to meet a lot of
                    interesting Americans and representatives of the steel companies or other
                    companies seeking relief from import competition. One of the import relief cases
                    involved Harley Davidson motorcycles. Harley Davidson was feeling a lot of
                    pressure from imported Japanese motorcycles and wanted some relief and got it.
                    So it was fascinating talking to all of these non-State Department, non-U.S.
                    Government Americans with their legitimate interests and concerns. And I think
                    the interagency process did a good job in assessing the situation and where
                    relief was warranted, providing relief which typically would be not as much as
                    had been asked for; it would be digressive, which meant that over time it
                    diminished and then went away. So I think we felt pretty good about ourselves
                    for weighing the competing interests and balancing considerations and doing the
                    right thing. I hope history judges us that way. It's nice to see in Harley's
                    case, for instance, still in business, so that's good; the Japanese competitors
                    are, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The role of this office was really to introduce into the
                        calculation the foreign relations, the broader perspective perhaps, than
                        just to protect the American manufacturers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well yes. So we performed that function and in addition we weren't the
                    office in State with a foreign country-specific interest. I mean, depending on
                    what the issue was, this was probably more true- well, it would depend on what
                    products were involved and where the products were manufactured. But sometimes
                    the country desks would be quite interested in a given proceeding so we would
                    interact with them. And I think they would- my perspective- their job was to
                    look after the relationship with their counterpart country so their focus was
                    somewhat different from ours, which was maybe moderating the protectionist
                    impulses of some of our colleagues here in town and making sure the foreign
                    policy considerations got taken into account and trying to keep us within the
                    letter and the spirit of the law. But in any event, we would interact not
                    infrequently with the country desks; that was always useful and informative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much directly to do with Congress on these
                        issues or was that pretty much handled by Commerce Department or the
                        other-?</hi>

                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>PARKER: I believe on one occasion I wrote some brief testimony on sort of a crash
                    basis over one weekend when the primary person responsible for this sphere of
                    activity was out of town for the weekend and the hearings, you know, say had
                    been announced Friday for Monday morning so I produced something pretty simple
                    for James Buckley, I believe was undersecretary for coordinating security
                    assistance; he was one of the top three or four guys in the department at the
                    time. But personally, I mean, I, myself never testified; probably had to answer
                    some Congressional correspondence although I don't have a clear recollection of
                    any particular letter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This division, special trade activities, was fairly small,
                        I think, but you were the assistant chief so you had some supervising
                        responsibilities, which probably was about, other than Vietnam, perhaps the
                        first time in your Foreign Service career that you had had that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. I think there were two junior officers who reported to me. One of
                    them did intellectual property issues, so that's something the division dealt
                    with. And-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that was special trade activity as opposed to import
                        protection.</hi>

                <p>PARKER: Yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Well, I've had, from my first assignment, which was back in 1959 to- no, 1958,
                    '59, I've known about STA; I had a roommate who worked there and so I know there
                    are pressures to kind of find a balance and sometimes you get pushed hard by
                    the, say the Japan desk and at the same time there's a lot of pressure to go
                    along with whatever is being done.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>PARKER: We had- One of our cases, and gosh, it's embarrassing that I can't
                    remember which case it was; I sort of think it must have been the case involving
                    our steel trade with the European Union because after we announced whatever
                    import relief we announced the Europeans just blasted us and hammered all of our
                    embassies. I put together a telegram, just making seven or eight points about
                    how much more import relief had been requested and we, the U.S. government,
                    could have granted much more relief. I also made the point that the relief was
                    digressive over time. As I say, seven or eight points with a paragraph for each
                    one, sent it out to all the embassies where I think it was well received. What
                    tickled me most was, we had a subsequent trip somewhere, I guess to follow the
                    same issue, and the top USTR (United States Trade Representative) person on the
                    particular trip had a copy of that cable in her briefing book so I felt that I
                    really had arrived, with my outgoing cable in her briefing book.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you travel much in this office or did you- were you
                        involved with discussions, negotiations with the European Union, with Japan,
                        with others that were affected?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: The only travel I remember was to Europe, Paris, Brussels; I don't
                    clearly recall- I had more than one such trip and this was for meetings with the
                    Europeans to talk about the steel trade so I do remember those trips. For the,
                    what must have been the specialty steel, Section 301 proceedings, I attended a
                    lot of meetings but they were all at USTR and all the foreign embassies would
                    come in, maybe with somebody from the capital, maybe just by themselves, to
                    argue and discuss. One of the mildly embarrassing aspects of those negotiations
                    were that, as I recall, the deputy USTR , a hotshot young lawyer named Robert
                    Lighthizer. You know Lighthizer?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard the name.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: He had told his people who would be negotiating with each country, what
                    the quota for that country would be, and he had told all of his staff, for your
                    country, you come up with a rationale to defend that quota. All the foreign
                    countries, of course, consulted with each other about how the negotiations were
                    going and what the rationales were and I think what was troubling, and I
                    apologize for the vagueness of details, it's not necessarily troubling that
                    different countries had different rationales but there was one particular
                    rationale which, let's say at the Lighthizer level had been explicitly disavowed
                    and we were ostensibly not setting these limits for these reasons. But half of
                    his subordinates hadn't gotten that word so that was precisely the rationale
                    they were using with their counterparts, and so this was, as I say, somewhat
                    embarrassing. But I think in this particular case we ended up being generous
                    enough with our quotas that the protests subsided, people moved on.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: A little under two years. I think the tour was cut short just by two or
                    three months so I could get into language training at FSI in the summer of 1984,
                    Spanish language training and then on to my next assignment, which was
                    Uruguay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. So you did some FSI Spanish language training to
                        supplement your Japanese and Vietnamese, which wouldn't have done you much
                        good in Montevideo, and you went to Uruguay, to the embassy in Montevideo in
                        what capacity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: I was the economic counselor in that small embassy. It was a very
                    exciting time because I think the election- no, the elections took place while I
                    was there so the military junta, which had been in power for X number of years,
                    had agreed to step aside peacefully. This was after the Falklands/Malvinas war
                    between Great Britain and Argentina, which brought the junta in that country
                    into great disrepute and led to their collapse pretty soon thereafter, as I
                    recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That somehow affected things in Uruguay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. I think the junta in Uruguay saw the handwriting on the wall or
                    decided to get out of the way of the steamroller so they stepped aside
                    gracefully. And the elections were pretty free and fair; they were a heck of a
                    lot freer and fairer than the recent ones in Tehran but what they had in common
                    was that the junta, on its way out, said each political party can choose its
                    candidate except one party cannot choose their top guy as their candidate; he
                    was forbidden to run so he didn't run. But after that it was a contested and
                    hard fought election so new leaders were peacefully elected and sworn in, took
                    their places. We all trooped over in due course and our ambassador presented his
                    credentials and I accompanied him, a lot of people accompanied him, so that was
                    exciting and the most interesting part was the imitation moon walk after you-
                    whatever we did, shook hands, I guess, and probably bowed a little bit, but
                    walking backwards away from the new president so you didn't turn your back on
                    the president. That was amusing.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>But it was an interesting time for an economic guy because the country had been
                    struggling with the long, severe, not just a recession or depression but really
                    a generation or so of economic decline as the fortunes of the world shifted away
                    from agriculture-based economies and some countries just didn't adjust as
                    quickly as they needed to. So Uruguay had been going downhill economically for a
                    long time; the evidence was very clear all over with very lovely European style
                    buildings but all of which were dirty and dilapidated. Anyway, lots of
                    interesting economic issues; the United States was trying to be helpful without
                    giving away the store. I mean, everybody has constraints; the United States
                    Government can't open up the bag of goodies for every needy country, I suppose.
                    We tried to be helpful to the Uruguayans, also pointing out that it was
                    important that they help themselves, but there was a lot of concern about their
                    debt, you know, external debt of developing countries so Uruguay was among that
                    group of debtor countries. Of course they were concerned with the protectionism
                    facing their exports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly what products?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Textiles. And in fact, unfortunately during my tenure there, we began
                    imposing quotas on their woolen textiles. Dick Imus, who was a textiles
                    negotiator for USTR, came down on one occasion accompanied by two or three
                    minders from the textile industry, and boy, they gave him a hard time. I mean, I
                    don't know how he stood it; they were in his face, shouting at him some of the
                    time because he was giving the Uruguayans a little something that was a big
                    something in the view of the American textile reps; it was coming out of their
                    hides so they were being very aggressive, vociferous in defending their
                    interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the United States have an aid program in Uruguay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: One was started when I was there, so USAID sent down, I think just one
                    full-time employee about halfway through my tour so that would have been 1985,
                    maybe 1986. A nice guy, we were friendly, and I was more than happy to
                    relinquish a chunk of my portfolio to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you supervise him? Or how was that-?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: No, I did not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Part of the country team.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: He was part of the country team, yes. A very nice relationship; friends
                    as well as colleagues and so we exchanged information, coordinated things.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>I think we saw the same thing in different ways in Uruguay. On the housing front,
                    when we got to Uruguay, embassy staff would live in separate houses, which we
                    had to find ourselves, it had to be within the budget approved by the embassy,
                    which got us very nice houses but all the military guys had houses that were
                    twice as large and twice as nice because they had allowances that were
                    presumably twice as large, so that was an inconsistency, I suppose, it seemed to
                    me. And similarly, I could not but notice, since I had to buy a second car, some
                    10 year old, beat up VW to drive back and forth to work, and the USAID guy came
                    and he got his own car provided by USAID and his own driver. So that rankled a
                    little bit. But that's life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talked a little bit about United States economic
                        interests in Uruguay at the time; are there others in terms of U.S. business
                        or investment, commercial opportunities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, there was certainly an American business community. In most cases
                    these were Uruguayans who were heading up the Uruguay operations of the American
                    business. There were lots of those around. There were several American banks;
                    CitiBank was there, Bank of America; a couple of others, Bank of Boston, so they
                    had offices. At least in the case of CitiBank and Bank of America they had
                    Americans in charge. I think in the others they had Uruguayans in charge. So
                    there was certainly a local business community and the ambassador would host
                    get-togethers I think once a month, bring all these guys together, shoot the
                    breeze, talk things over. But I think our major interest, occasionally an
                    American businessman would walk in with a problem of some sort which he expected
                    the American embassy immediately to resolve for him so we would do our best to
                    be helpful, offer our good offices. But the major interest was in trying to
                    encourage Uruguay to follow good economic policies so as to breathe some life
                    into its economy, and I think they were heading in the right direction.</p>
                <p>It was interesting; they had a number of very well trained economists; I mean,
                    many of them had been trained in the United States at University of Chicago or
                    Harvard or-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Michigan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: I don't remember any from Michigan but I don't doubt it. And these were
                    all, you know, free market guys and gals. I almost hesitated over the word
                    “gal.” The only female colleague that I recall happened to be in the foreign
                    ministry but she was concerned with economic affairs. I don't think she had been
                    educated in the United States.</p>
                <p>So we nudged and prodded and they seemed to be making progress with their
                    external debt. I'm sure there was a rescheduling or two and I think I was
                    involved in that. I did observe one interesting thing with the passage of time.
                    We had several visits; we had one from Secretary Shultz himself who came down to
                    show support for this renascent democracy.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Secretary of State George Shultz.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, Secretary of State George Shultz. And, well, we had other senior
                    officers come through from time to time but I noticed it just always seemed that
                    the Uruguayans were extremely friendly and comfortable with the senior
                    Department of State colleagues and I wondered why until one day I think I saw
                    some international conference on TV somewhere and then it occurred to me,
                    delegations are seated alphabetically in these big halls and Uruguay was right
                    next to the United States and so they got to know each other that way, I think.
                    They were quite friendly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The kind of advice the United States was giving and you
                        were giving in terms of sound economic practices in this period was also
                        probably the advice they were getting from the International Monetary Fund
                        and the World Bank.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Oh, I think so, sure. And probably those institutions, I'm sure it was
                    safe to say, would take the lead. I mean, that's their job as impartial,
                    authoritative, but they both had, you know, small offices in Uruguay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you kept in touch with them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, indeed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was your Spanish after FSI training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: It was pretty good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Certainly good enough to conduct business.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. I could do that. It varied, I guess you probably experienced this
                    yourself, but somehow these things just sort themselves out and with some people
                    you speak your language and some people you speak their language, whatever seems
                    most comfortable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The- Who was the ambassador during this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>PARKER: When I first arrived it was Thomas Aranda. He was from one of our
                    southwestern states and a Republican donor. And he was followed by a retired
                    federal appellate judge, Malcolm Wilkey. Wilkey had been active in some part of
                    the Watergate legal proceedings; he had issued some important rulings and he was
                    one of these guys who has a gallery of photos going back over his career that
                    shows him with everybody under the sun. So he brought his collection, had them
                    up in his office. But he was, in addition to being extremely smart and
                    accomplished and a good ambassador, just a genuinely nice person who was happy
                    to associate with relatively junior people, get along with them very nicely. He
                    was very wise; he gave me good advice more than once.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your immediate supervisor was the DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember who that was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Let's see. When I first arrived it was Richard Melton and then he left
                    and his place was taken by Richard Brown. So those were the two. Just very
                    different styles. I mean, I think they were both equally competent and good at
                    what they did but I'll say Richard was, I think his subordinates found him
                    easier to get along with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which Richard?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: I'm sorry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Since they both have the same first name, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Melton.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Melton, okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: And I can say that now with a clear conscience, I think, because
                    unfortunately Richard Brown died several years ago; he was pretty young. Too
                    bad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And why don't you say something about the composition of
                        the economic/commercial section. You were the counselor or the chief.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. Oh, well this was greatly amusing because when I arrived the
                    economic section, of which I was counselor, consisted of one American, me, and
                    then two local national professionals who focused primarily on commercial work.
                    There were three, actually; I think three local national professionals. There
                    was also an agricultural attach� who pretty much went his independent way. I
                    mean, we were perfectly friendly and exchanged information; we were both on the
                    country team but I didn't supervise him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was resident in Montevideo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. I'm sorry if I wasn't clear; he was Uruguayan and not American.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: He was Uruguayan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you didn't supervise him so he was supervised by who?
                        The agricultural attach� in Buenos Aires?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, yes. It was interesting because at some point during my tour
                    agriculture determined that it was going to eliminate this position so
                    practically overnight this guy became my best friend and I think, it wasn't me
                    personally but with the help of the DCM and the ambassador he might have been
                    made part-time or reduced hours of some sort, some belt tightening but at least
                    he kept a job.</p>
                <p>But I was always amazed because economics was so important to Uruguay and we
                    wanted to be supportive and most of the ways we could be supportive were
                    economic ways, and yet I was there as the only American, physically separate
                    from the political section, by the way, which was up on the third floor in the
                    secure part of the embassy; I was down on the first floor, the less prestigious,
                    less secure, more accessible part of the embassy. The point is, there must have
                    been, let's say the ambassador, DCM, three or four political officers up there
                    and one economic officer. When I looked around the embassy and every other
                    section, whether it was USIA or the two military offices, I can't even recall
                    what the two were but they were two distinct military offices and every other
                    office in the embassy had three or four or five people and the economic section
                    had one. So I actually put this into a telegram at one point, obviously the
                    ambassador signed off on it, said it would be nice to get some help in the
                    economic section, so they did send a brand spanking new junior officer but at
                    least we then had two Americans.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: While I was still there, yes. So that provided a little relief, which was
                    good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned, I think you said, that two of the locally

                        commercial service from the Department of Commerce have anybody in the kind
                        of the region that looked after Uruguay or were you pretty much doing
                        whatever you could on the commercial side with no input from FCS?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. I don't recall any input from FCS. I mean, there were probably
                    written communications occasionally but that's all that I remember right
                    now.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, I don't want flatly to deny it; let's just say that I don't
                    remember. I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if there were some communications. I
                    remember talking to the agriculture guy in Buenos Aires so, I'm sure of
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Anything else about your time in Uruguay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, let's see. What had happened? I guess at this point in time
                    Qaddafi, leader of Libya, was still in his full bad guy mode, and he had done
                    something to irritate President Reagan, so we had bombed Libya, as I recall, in
                    the mid '80s for whatever reason, which seemed like a good reason at the time.
                    So as a result of that we were heightening our security level in Uruguay. There
                    was, just across the estuary, the River Plate, in Buenos Aires, a representative
                    office of Libya, whatever it was called, Peoples Office or something like that,
                    but there was a Libyan establishment in Buenos Aires so we felt threatened so we
                    spent a lot of time and money tearing down a particular fence around the embassy
                    and building a much larger, stronger, concrete perimeter fence, perimeter wall,
                    to protect us, and we were also advised from time to time to take certain
                    security precautions in our daily routines, do this and don't do that. So that
                    was obviously just a foretaste of what was to come later on, after 9/11. But
                    security was heightened because of concerns about Libya so we all took note of
                    that. Otherwise the Uruguayan military stepped aside quietly and watched their
                    budget be cut.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>Oh, here's an interesting little tidbit on the utility of the Foreign Service. I
                    mentioned these two large military offices but it was one of the three Foreign
                    Service nationals I had who in doing his job came up with some detailed
                    budgetary data, unclassified Uruguayan military budget data, which he passed
                    along to one of the military offices and these guys thought this was the best
                    single piece of information they'd ever gotten their hands on about the
                    Uruguayan military budget. And he gave it to the wrong office so that office
                    gave it to the other office. In any event they were all impressed with the
                    intelligence collection skills of this guy. It was, again, apparently publicly
                    available data but this guy had the expertise to get it out for whatever
                    reason.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To know where to look for it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Know where to look and how to find it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Montevideo, as you said, is very close to Buenos Aires,
                        across the River Plate. Did you have much to do with the embassy in Buenos
                        Aires or with anything related to Argentina?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Honestly the only contact I recall was with the agricultural attach� and
                    that was in the context of the proposal to do away with the position in Uruguay.
                    I visited Buenos Aires two or three times for fun; on one occasion the CITES
                    member states were having their big meeting in Buenos Aires so I actually ran
                    into several of them on the street and I could recognize from a few years
                    previously so we chatted a bit. But I think there was essentially no contact
                    with Argentina.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Anything else about your time in Montevideo? And it
                        began in '84 and continued until?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Spring of 1987.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, probably the least pleasant aspect was hosting the- was welcoming
                    the team of U.S. negotiators who had come down to impose quotas on Uruguayan
                    textile exports. So that wasn't fun but as I believe I said already, quotas we
                    handed out were about as liberal as we could make them. Uruguayans soldiered on,
                    noting the difference between our stated devotion to principles of free trade on
                    the one hand and imposing quotas on exports from the country which ostensibly we
                    were trying to help on the other.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other significant Uruguayan exports to the

                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>PARKER: Well this is embarrassing; I honestly don't recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about U.S. exports to Uruguay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well probably machinery and information technology stuff of one sort or
                    another.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to do much in the export promotion area or
                        was there-?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, there was a big agricultural fair in Montevideo every year. We
                    participated in that with a U.S. pavilion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Agricultural?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. And every year for a number of years the American embassy had rented
                    a certain building and then we would line up representatives of the American
                    business community to rent space and display their wares. So we did that for
                    three years and it was generally a tough selling job because we didn't give
                    these spaces away; they were, I mean, they were not exorbitantly expensive but
                    for a small country, depressed economy and struggling business any expenditure
                    is an important one, I guess. Nevertheless we generally filled the pavilion and
                    had nice displays and the ambassador would go over and open the pavilion with a
                    nice speech. I guess the last year we were there we actually solicited local
                    artists to bid on a project to create a miniature Statue of Liberty and by golly
                    some local artist created this beautiful replica of the Statue of Liberty, maybe
                    20 feet tall, made of papier-m�ch� or something but it really looked good and
                    that was a nice touch.</p>
                <p>So these things were always fun; I mean, I'd go out every day while the fair was
                    running, since I was responsible for the American participation, I'd walk over
                    and talk to the exhibitors, getting the feel for what was going on. Another
                    trade promotion effort was this. The Uruguayans actually mounted, with the help
                    of the commercial section, they mounted- I'm sorry, the economic section with
                    its two FSNs focusing on commercial affairs — the local Uruguayan-American
                    business community did put together a trade mission to the United States which
                    went, as I recall, just to Miami, and it was moderately successful. We were
                    actually cautioned once or twice by our Washington colleagues, I mean, no more
                    than the country desk, to the effect that the United States was also concerned
                    about its enormous trade deficit at this time so let's concentrate on American
                    exports rather than Uruguayan exports. So I did have my chain jerked a little
                    bit but the trade mission went forward and had some modest success.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>I do feel embarrassed, I just have to say this, it's just been so long and my
                    memory is so vague but I've had another career since then and the years have
                    passed. I'm sorry I can't remember more detail for you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well, why don't we leave it at that? But let me ask
                        you; Uruguay is a relatively small country in South America and Montevideo I
                        guess is, having never been there I'm really sort of guessing at this, but I
                        assume that much of the action, much of the business activity is centered in
                        the capital, in Montevideo.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you travel much around the country or did you really
                        need to do that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well I think it's always desirable and traveling around the country
                    probably helps you do a better job. I did a little of it but not a lot. I wasn't
                    pushed by the ambassador to do a lot but I had a few trips, primarily
                    agricultural orientation tours. And once or twice in addition low level
                    delegations of working level executive branch people, the USTR, State, somebody
                    would come down, we'd organize something and get them out into the countryside
                    to talk to people and look at things. So we certainly did see the countryside;
                    saw lots of sheep. That was their most numerous kind of animal. And the country
                    is famed for its- its well-known for its wool and textiles, produces very nice
                    wool and textiles. I still have, as a matter of fact, 20 years later, some very
                    heavy, hand-knitted wool sweaters that I bought, I don't know, I think they
                    might have been $25 a piece back in the mid 1980s; beautiful sweaters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's the name of the- is it a resort where a number of
                        major hemispheric conferences have been held?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. A nice beach resort on the Atlantic, Punta del Este, which means
                    Eastern Point or some such. It's where the estuary reaches the ocean and the
                    shoreline sort of curves so I guess that's the point of Punta del Este. Oh, an
                    amazing place, nothing but- I wouldn't say nothing but, but plenty of beautiful
                    high rise buildings and then a little further from the beach these gigantic
                    luxurious homes of the wealthy Argentineans, primarily. Oh, there used to be a
                    funny little story about how the Russian invasion of Afghanistan led to the
                    building of Punta del Este; just two or three steps but I don't know, the
                    Russians invade Afghanistan, the United States embargos imports of Russian
                    grain. Did that happen? Well that's the story and since we weren't purchasing
                    grain from Russia any longer we had to buy it somewhere else; we started buying
                    from Argentina, which expanded its production substantially; couldn't meet the
                    American demand. A lot of people got rich in Argentina selling grain to the U.S.
                    They had to put their money somewhere so they put it into Punta del Este. So
                    that was the story at the time.</p>

                <p>PARKER: Of trade negotiations, yes, I'm sorry, which I think was a successful
                    round, ultimately. I mean, I don't think anything necessarily happened during
                    the 10 days that they were at Punta del Este but at least that round was
                    successful over two or three years. I mean, the current round has been going on
                    for eight or nine years, hasn't it, with no end in sight.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: I was officially on the delegation; I did not go to Punta. You know, I
                    greeted some of the people as they came through. I might have gotten a telephone
                    call or two from Punta asking, you know, something about-</p>

                <p>PARKER: Well, it just came to mind, thinking of the visitors from USTR, we did
                    have a visitor from the U.S. Treasury Department, then-assistant secretary for
                    international affairs, let's say. Mulford was his last name but he was
                    definitely-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: David.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>PARKER: David Mulford, a very high powered guy, driven, demanding of his staff,
                    allegedly hard to get along with. But he came down and had several nice meetings
                    with the topmost Uruguayan economic and financial officials and I was his escort
                    officer and accompanied him the entire time and he was just as nice as he could
                    be to me, I'm happy to say, and actually in the evening, he was free one evening
                    so my wife and I took him and his wife who accompanied him out to dinner, so
                    that was nice. But obviously I was on pins and needles the entire time because
                    of the guy's reputation but he was just as nice as he could be to me.</p>
                <p>Let's see. I guess it was Enrique Iglesias who was minister of foreign affairs
                    when Mulford came through and for some period of time, and the United States
                    liked Iglesias a lot, which had something to do with the fact that he ended up
                    as president of the Inter-American Development Bank. Anyway, Mulford's visit was
                    a challenge but it turned out well so that was good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And when you didn't have a visit t like that I assume that
                        a good part of your time was spent on seeing senior economic finance
                        officials, head of the Central Bank and stuff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, I had access to the minister of finance. I mean, the ambassador did
                    too, when he wanted to, but I had access to the guy; the guy would call me on
                    the telephone. The same with the head of the Central Bank and initially with the
                    head, I forget exactly the name but some planning organization but I passed this
                    guy off to the AID man when AID came in because this entity of the Uruguayan
                    government was concerned with its own development efforts so that seemed the
                    logical thing to do. But one thing I did which perhaps served to ingratiate me
                    with the officials was we used to get this sheaf of paper from USIA every day; I
                    don't even recall what it was called.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wireless file?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Wireless file, probably, with all the speeches of the top level guys or
                    policy pronouncements or what have you, and I would carefully tear out the ones
                    that I thought would be of interest to the respective people; often they came in
                    Spanish as well as English. Send them along so I think that was appreciated.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Uruguay has very nice people, very well disposed toward the United
                    States. I should qualify that a little bit, I mean certainly on an individual
                    level just as nice as they can be. As you no doubt well know the political
                    spectrum in Latin America is considerably to the left of the spectrum in our
                    country so I think there was a bit of criticism towards some of the things we
                    did and some of our general policies and approaches to life. But in any event,
                    under this particular president, Sanguinetti, who led the conservative party in
                    Uruguay, all of these senior people I mentioned earlier were very well disposed
                    towards the United States; I think we had a good relationship at that time .</p>

                    to tell you a lot of what they did. I do recall- I was chatting with somebody
                    recently; it must have been you, maybe not, about the historian at the State
                    Department. No, discussing at the DACOR lunch the other day, Diplomatic and
                    Consular Officers Retired luncheon, talking to somebody about the historian and
                    funny experiences and FOIA process, Freedom of Information Act, all those
                    things. But in any event during my tour in MMO there was some little issue that
                    had the outside historians and anybody who's interested in foreign affairs want
                    to get their hands on all of these documents detailing the foreign relations of
                    the United States, the sooner the better, and I think the practice has been to
                    publish papers which survived the review process and were felt suitable for
                    release, somewhere between 25 and 30 years after the fact, so this was too long
                    for people to wait in the opinion of the outsiders but the Department was pretty
                    well satisfied with the system as it had worked over the years. I don't recall
                    the disposition of that particular issue or even exactly what it was except that
                    the outsiders wanted speedier access to the papers.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>But each analyst in the MMO office had a geographic bureau with whose structure,
                    both domestically and in the embassies overseas, they were supposed to be
                    familiar, quite familiar; knowledgeable, keep track of all the number of
                    positions, FTEs, full time equivalents, as they were called. When budget cuts
                    were required we would talk to the bureaus about reducing the number of FTEs;
                    you probably experienced this from your end; I don't know, maybe not. But I
                    wasn't there for very long. Oh, and then actually, oh sure, for one point, there
                    was a big budget cutting operation underway and a career person, Ambassador
                    Brandon Grove, had been designated the point man, I guess under the secretary or
                    maybe under the undersecretary for management, to pull together budget cutting
                    ideas so three or four people were seconded to his little ad hoc office,
                    probably one from the comptroller's office, me from MMO, one or two others from
                    somewhere, and so we spent a month or two or three on this budget cutting
                    exercise, and again, I don't know the results. We just always seemed to be
                    cutting. Budget cutting is painful, as you know. Of course you save big bucks by
                    closing consulates or closing embassies but doing that is somewhat at odds with
                    our purpose in life. So as a result we were just always looking for these really
                    rather small savings which hopefully if they added up would amount to something
                    without crippling the Department.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Trying to do it at the margins.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: At the margins, exactly.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rather than the core.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>You mentioned that in MMO each analyst had a geographic bureau and then you also
                    had some of the functional offices, and maybe that's where you got involved with
                    the historian's office?</p>
                <p>PARKER: I don't know how I happened to get that assignment. I honestly don't
                    remember if I had any continuing responsibilities for the historian. I don't
                    think so; I think this was just something that bubbled up and had to be given to
                    somebody to work on so it was given to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a geographic bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, ARA, American Republics, Latin American bureau; from Mexico on
                    south.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. And you mentioned that you weren't there all that
                        long and then moved over to the economic business bureau. Anything else
                        about MMO or should be talk about what you did in EB?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>PARKER: Well I don't know if this would be out of line to report but of course
                    everything this little ad hoc office under Ambassador Grove did was supposedly-
                    it was extremely closely held and generally I think it was but occasionally some
                    budget cutting idea aimed at one's own sponsoring organization would arise so I
                    would, for better or worse, right or wrong, get on the telephone to somebody in
                    MMO to tell them to prepare themselves, prepare to defend against this
                    particular proposal. I suspect my colleagues from the other branches were doing
                    the same thing but I'll tell you one other recollection I have from this time,
                    getting away from my own ethics now. But it was the darnedest thing; times were
                    tough at the State Department, all this cutting here, cutting there, and you'd
                    go down to the comptroller's office, what was his name? Was it Roger
                    Feldman?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: He got fired ultimately; not for cause, just for change of administration
                    or something. And they had the best lighted, most nicely furnished offices with
                    the latest contemporary modular furniture. This was just such a contrast between
                    the rest of the Department and the comptroller's office. I mean how on earth he
                    got away with that I don't know; whoever approved that I don't know but
                    certainly it did not seem appropriate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So when there were savings and cuts they didn't seem to be
                        absorbed into that office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Then you became deputy director of the executive
                        office, the economic business bureau. What did you go there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well I guess I had some responsibilities for the bureau budget, because I
                    seem to remember spending a lot of time pouring over the budget as time passed
                    through the year. The comptroller would authorize the spending of money quarter
                    by quarter so we had to live on a quarterly budget. So I did spend a lot of time
                    paying attention to the budget.</p>
                <p>I spent a lot of time; I guess I mentioned this the other day, at least in the
                    annual cycle I spent a lot of time reviewing efficiency reports throughout the
                    bureau. The executive director would be absent from time to time; it was an
                    extended absence or two, maybe just a two week vacation so I'd fill in for him
                    and whatever was of interest to the assistant secretary at the time I had to be
                    on top of. Go to the morning staff meetings and report for EX, the executive
                    director's office to the bureau staff meeting.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And did you get involved, besides budget issues and

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: No. I mean, I certainly would be aware at the time of year that it was
                    going on but the top guy, David Burns, handled that. He probably kept me
                    informed, maybe I sat in on some of the meetings but I honestly did not have any
                    direct responsibility.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now the economic business bureau in those days was largely
                        Foreign Service, Civil Service, some combination of the two?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: I'd say mostly Foreign Service. Well, the executive director's office
                    might have been an exception. We certainly had the Civil Servants in that office
                    for year in, year out to provide continuity, the nuts and bolts of running the
                    bureau. But the bureau as a whole was mostly FSOs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: I'll tell you what; I may or may not have anything else to say but may I
                    break for five minutes?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure, let's take a break.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Okay, Tom, you were going to say something about your experience in Japan, which
                    was much earlier.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, one incident that I recalled and I think is amusing and you may find
                    it so. But as I told you, my first assignment in the embassy in Tokyo was
                    working on the Okinawa reversion negotiations, and the agreement that we
                    ultimately arrived at consisted of a number of documents. I mean, first of all
                    there was the formal agreement between the United States of America and Japan
                    concerning the Ryukyu Islands and the Dait? Islands, but there were a number,
                    and whether that's 10 or 20 I don't recall, but there were a number of other
                    ancillary documents addressing particular issues or points, and these were of
                    various levels of formality and various levels of confidentiality; some were
                    quite sensitive. So once the negotiations had concluded, before the agreement
                    had been signed, as junior guy in the section I was sent over to the foreign
                    ministry, one guy with our complete collection of all these documents, to go
                    over them one by one with the foreign ministry to make sure they had the same
                    set of documents or see if they had any other ones, and so make sure that the
                    set of documents was consistent, and also to agree on the degree of
                    confidentiality of each document. So I did that.</p>
                <p>So I went back to the embassy and we had our set of documents and they had
                    theirs, and I guess maybe even before the agreement was signed at the ceremony I
                    previously described, or within a day or two thereafter, the office of which I
                    was a part of at the embassy, one way or another bundled up a lot of stuff to
                    ship back to Washington, and within a day or two after that we started looking
                    for a copy of the agreement. We couldn't find one. We had apparently, I say
                    “we,” I think we ended up blaming it on the secretary, but we had apparently
                    shipped all of our copies of the set of papers back to Washington, couldn't find
                    a single one. And we needed a set to talk to Washington and to talk to the
                    foreign ministry. So we, “we,” the boss, Charles Schmitz, got on the phone to
                    one of our counterparts at the foreign ministry and just explained. I don't
                    think he said we had shipped it back to Washington; I think he said something
                    about disarray here in the office and can't find it right this minute and could
                    they please send us a set, and they were happy to do it. And luckily each set
                    had the documents in both languages. So that was our set of the agreement for
                    some time thereafter. But that was mildly embarrassing and it could have been
                    inconvenient but it all worked out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think I may have asked you this before but let me ask it
                        again, were you involved in the two languages or only in English in terms of
                        that negotiation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Only in English. I did remember, after you asked me that the other day,
                    that at one point I looked at the primary agreement, whose long name I gave you
                    a minute ago, and I was able to read that in Japanese so my Japanese was that
                    good, but it was never my responsibility to make sure the Japanese was accurate
                    and-</p>

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: No, I think that's it for Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else about your assignment to be deputy executive

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: No. It was useful, getting an idea of how a bureau functions. It was nuts
                    and bolt stuff. I might have brought a little more organization into the office;
                    I think I came up with some sort of tracking system for all the dozens if not
                    hundreds of issues before the executive office at any given time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were beginning to use- computers were beginning to be

                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. Actually, we were quite happy because Dave Burns had placed the
                    order before I arrived and I believe just about the time I arrived we got our
                    first tranche of modern computer equipment, costing of two, count them, two
                    CPUs, which I believe at one point later on, maybe the comptroller questioned
                    whether that had not been extravagant. Nevertheless we had a back up so if the
                    one ever went down we came right back up. So we had the CPUs and the work
                    stations were being distributed very rapidly through the bureau sI saw it
                    happening, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Anything else about that? And, I think it's getting
                        close to the point where you left the Department of State and ended your

                <p>PARKER: Yes, that is true. I don't mind telling you that it was while I was in EX
                    that I got the dread telephone call from the director general's office,
                    informing me that I would not be with the department for 20 more years. But the
                    good news about that was that I was in Washington when I got that bad news and
                    so I had another year in which I could do networking and pounding the pavement
                    and interviewing, and I did do a lot of that, although I was very conscientious,
                    counting as annual leave every minute that I was out of the office looking for a
                    job. And it was a fascinating experience; met lots of interesting people, had
                    lots of interesting conversations. And just in the nick of time—I think I'd left
                    the Department the first day of October-</p>

                <p>PARKER: Yes. And so, no more than a month before that I had landed a job with a
                    trade association. I guess I started with them the 10th day of October of
                    1989.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was helpful to you. Or at least- And it also gave you
                        some time to-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes, yes I think- Does that last as long as three months?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say 90 days, yes, three months.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: In addition to maybe two or three weeks of pretty intense training,
                    instruction of one sort or another and the nuts and bolts of job hunting. Then
                    you've got two months to pound the pavement and look for a job while you're
                    still on the payroll so that's very nice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you took a position with the Trade Association, which
                        was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: The trade association, which was the Chemical Manufacturers Association,
                    worked through committees made up of its member company representatives plus
                    staff from the association, so they had an energy committee, since the chemical
                    industry is a big energy consumer, and they needed somebody to run that
                    committee. So they hired me to do that, which fit very well with my economic
                    cone experience, although ironically, I think energy was maybe the single part
                    of the entire panoply of economic work that I'd never done. I dabbled in
                    agriculture and then civil aviation; I mean, almost everything you could think
                    of.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Trade.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Trade but never energy. But, haven been present, I'd obviously read lots
                    of traffic and was aware of progression of events the previous 15 or 20 years.
                    So that worked out very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Anything else you want to say about your Foreign
                        Service career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, I would say in retrospect, I mean, I'm sorry I didn't have a longer
                    career. The three overseas assignments were all fascinating, whether or not I
                    conveyed that appropriately they were all great assignments, even Vietnam.
                    Obviously I was careful in Vietnam but for a young guy that was a fascinating
                    experience. And knowing the language made all the difference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It also helped to be in a relatively peaceful-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: -province, district.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Absolutely, yes. So, sorry the career wasn't longer. I had three great
                    assignments. I guess towards the end in Uruguay we were beginning to get the
                    feeling that maybe it was an especially good career for young people. I mean, I
                    had gotten married and our first child was born in Japan, as a matter of fact,
                    and we had two more, a total of three by the time we got to Uruguay. And my wife
                    had become a CPA (certified public accountant) during our eight consecutive
                    years in the States, between Japan and Uruguay. And so it gets tougher when
                    you've got a spouse who's got her own career and you've got children. You know
                    all this stuff but nevertheless it was a great 22 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have all three children with you in Uruguay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And there was an adequate school for them there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>PARKER: Yes. There was an “Uruguay American School”, which was quite
                    satisfactory. I mean the young one was just an infant, literally three months
                    old when we went down there. So we had the opportunity to watch her as an infant
                    learning two languages simultaneously, which is fascinating. As soon as she
                    could speak in English she could speak in Spanish just as well. In fact, towards
                    the end of our tour we would amuse ourselves by asking her to interpret between
                    us and our maid, our 40 hour a week maid; never had a live-in maid; and our
                    daughter would do it perfectly. We'd say, “Susanna, tell the maid”, whose name
                    was Santa, “tell Santa we're going to the ice cream store.” And Susanna would
                    tell Santa this in Spanish. And the maid would say something in Spanish and it
                    would come back would come back to us through Susanna in English. We could
                    monitor both ends of the conversation. Anyway, that was just fascinating to
                    watch that process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How is Susanna's Spanish today?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: I'm sorry to say it's not very good. Her oldest sister kept it up very
                    assiduously. She took Spanish all through the remainder of middle school and
                    high school and I think maybe even ran out of courses her senior year in high
                    school. Took it again in college; spent her junior year in Spain, all of her
                    classes were in Spanish in Spain, and then lived three years in Argentina, just
                    enjoying a young person's adventure down there, on her dime, for three years. So
                    her Spanish is still excellent. I guess she's a little rusty now since she's
                    been back for seven years. But the number two daughter's also pretty
                    conscientious; at least she kept it up through high school but that was probably
                    the end of it. And number three, Susanna, just was never that interested, even
                    though she learned it as an infant. So she let hers get away from her.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your wife able to work either in Japan or
                        Uruguay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Well, in Japan, not legally, but she found employment with a little
                    publishing company which was an arm of MITI, Ministry of International Trade and
                    Industry. They put out a little English language magazine, I don't know,
                    “Japan's Trade,” or something like that, so she would both edit the English
                    writing of her Japanese colleagues or she would write articles herself. But she
                    never had her work visa so this was illegal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But for a government agency, or at least an aspect of
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: But she would go, I mean, her Japanese colleague took her down to the
                    immigration office about every six months. And there would be a long,
                    inconclusive conversation about my wife's status and what she was doing and they
                    would part company with many bows and-</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tea. Every good drunk, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: And this would be good for about six more months and they'd repeat that
                    process. So she survived that without being arrested or expelled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And in Uruguay she had an infant, you said.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PARKER: Had an infant and also had the advantage of having a 40 hour a week maid.
                    So, she was a brand new CPA in Uruguay so she did individual income tax returns
                    for Americans. Or for anybody who needed to file a U.S. income tax return. She
                    was the auditor for the embassy commissary and I think that was about it. So
                    basically she had a very good time in Uruguay. She and the oldest daughter enjoy
                    horseback riding; they ride in the form of riding dressage. So they had a good
                    time doing that. And, of course, she was a wonderful wife and mother and also
                    very good at representational functions, one reason being, as I think I said,
                    she was formerly a Foreign Service officer herself.</p>
