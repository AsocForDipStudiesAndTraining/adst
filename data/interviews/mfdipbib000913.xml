                <p>AMBASSADOR JACK R. PERRY</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Henry E. Mattox </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: July 2, 1992</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an interview with Dr. Jack Perry, in his office at
                        Davidson College, Davidson, North Carolina. Could I ask you, Jack, to give
                        for the record some of the background on where you came from and your
                        educational background and some of your professional experience before you
                        went into the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: I was born in 1930 in Atlanta, and went to public schools in Atlanta, and
                    then I went to a Baptist college in Georgia called Mercer University, and
                    graduated from there in 1951, and went into the Army during the Korean War.
                    While I was in the Army, I was given a year of Russian language instruction at
                    Monterey, which affected my career from then on. When I got out of the Army in
                    1954, I stayed in Atlanta for a year working for the Associated Press, and then
                    went back to my alma mater for a year, in journalism. Then I went to graduate
                    school at Columbia University, at the Russian Institute, and spent three years
                    there. I worked towards my Ph.D. and got it all done but the dissertation, which
                    I finally finished in 1972. And then I went into the Foreign Service in
                    1959.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, two questions about that, that we've gotten to so
                        far. How did the Army choose you to go to Monterey? And, second, what was it
                        that attracted you to a Foreign Service career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: The first question about the Army is hard for me to answer—I don't know
                    how the Army's mind works. I think that they had quotas. They were training
                    people in Chinese and in Russian and other such languages for the Korean War.
                    And the Army Security Agency, which I was recruited for (for the simple reason
                    that they had a recruiting station in Atlanta), said, “If you want to go to
                    language school for a year, sign up with us.” And then they gave me Russian; I
                    didn't ask for it. It was more or less happenstance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had not previously been interested in Russian language
                        studies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: No, never, nothing. And in my undergraduate days, I never had a course in
                    political science or in anything international, to amount to anything. I was an
                    English major.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Now for the second question: How did I get interested in the Foreign Service. By
                    the time I had been through the Army, and had spent a year in Japan in the Army,
                    and then came back home and worked for the Associated Press in Atlanta for a
                    year, and had a little bit of a look at the world, I decided I wanted to go to
                    graduate school. And graduate school in Soviet affairs at that time, which was
                    the height of the Cold War, seemed a sensible thing to do. Once I got into the
                    graduate program at Columbia, I was not particularly attracted to teaching, but
                    was attracted to diplomatic things, and therefore decided to take the Foreign
                    Service exam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, to set the scene a little further, before we get
                        down to the end of anything, I'll just note here that you're the director of
                        the Dean Rusk Program in International Studies here at Davidson College, and
                        you hold the rank of professor of political science. You've been here since
                        retirement from the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: I retired and went first to the Citadel in Charleston for three years, and
                    then came here in 1985.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You took the exam and obviously passed. You were
                        commissioned an FSO in 1959, with a background in Russian studies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your first assignment, then, after FSI?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: My first assignment, to my astonishment, was the State Department. I had
                    thought that everybody went overseas first, but back in those days, at least,
                    not everybody did — because we got stuck in Washington for two years, living in
                    a very inferior apartment which we had thought we were only going to be in for a
                    few months. However, the job was great. My first assignment was the Soviet
                    Exchanges Staff, which was created in 1957, I think, to follow up on the “spirit
                    of Geneva.” Our office handled cultural exchanges with the Russians. So my first
                    two years I spent working in the Bureau of European Affairs on Soviet exchanges,
                    a fascinating assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Give me an example of what you might do, what your office
                        was responsible for.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: My boss for those two years was a very fine FSO named Frank Siscoe, who
                    had already served in Moscow. Frank assigned me to cover, among other things,
                    tourism. There was an effort then to increase tourism to the Soviet Union, and
                    to try to get more Russians to come to the United States, which was, of course,
                    a very different kettle of fish.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>One of my fun endeavors was to escort a group of Soviet tourist experts around
                    the United States, to places like Miami and Chicago and other places that Soviet
                    tourists might be going. And, needless to say, that was a great learning
                    experience.</p>
                <p>Another fun time I had was when we were staging exhibits in the Soviet Union, and
                    they were staging exhibits reciprocally in the United States. We were about to
                    open a medical exhibit in Moscow, and they were about to open one Oklahoma City.
                    The Soviets were not giving us the kind of facilities in Moscow we felt we had
                    to have to stage a successful exhibit. So Frank Siscoe, my boss, being a pretty
                    combative fellow, determined that, by God, if they weren't going to let us do it
                    right, we weren't going to have the exhibit, and we weren't going to let them
                    open their exhibit in Oklahoma City. So he sent me out to Oklahoma City to stand
                    in the door, as it were, and forbid the Russians from opening their exhibit.
                    Well, it was sort of a nervous assignment, because the Oklahoma State Fair was
                    going to feature this medical exhibit from the Soviet Union, and, needless to
                    say, in those days (this was 1961, I suppose), there was a lot of excitement
                    about Soviet exhibits. I literally had to go up to the tent and say, “You cannot
                    open.” And since the State Department's not used to having that kind of power, I
                    wasn't sure it would work. But, sure enough, it did work. And it turned out to
                    be quite a pleasant time, because the people of Oklahoma City understood and
                    they didn't blame us — and they took those Russian doctors (there was a whole
                    gaggle of them with this exhibit) to their hearts. And so the Russian doctors
                    had a wonderful time, because they were entertained by the doctors of Oklahoma
                    City every night.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we in a period of detente at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: It's always hard to say exactly what was “a period of detente,” but I
                    think you would say so. I can't remember the exact timing of this, but I believe
                    it may have been in the last year of the Eisenhower administration or the first
                    year of the Kennedy administration. At any rate, it was before the Cuban missile
                    crisis, and therefore things were relatively good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With that kind of background and that kind of initial
                        assignment, you were clearly on track for a Moscow assignment. According to
                        my estimation, you went off in '62 as personnel officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: Yes, being personnel officer was a funny thing. The embassy in Moscow was
                    trying to expand its number of officers who spoke Russian, because there were so
                    many things to be done besides work in the office. Since all of our officers in
                    Moscow who spoke Russian (and most of us did) could travel and could see the
                    country in a way you couldn't in Moscow, they could potentially make contacts
                    with the Russians and all the rest of it, so they were trying to expand the
                    staff. And they came up the idea of adding that year a personnel officer and an
                    assistant GSO (General Services Officer), both of whom were youngish, junior
                    Russian speakers. So I felt lucky to get the job.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>It was a very tedious job. I kept the leave cards and planned people's travel and
                    other 'personnelly' type things for a year before I got promoted (I guess it's a
                    promotion) to the Political Section.</p>
                <p>But the interesting thing about it, I think, is that the Soviets seemed to think
                    that my job was a CIA position. I guess to them personnel seemed a little bit
                    sensitive, and they seemed to think that I might be CIA. And they treated me
                    with a great deal of attention. The surveillance that I got (and my wife, too,
                    who got even more than I did) was very strong.</p>
                <p>There was a Yale professor, Frederick Barghoorn (this was the second year of the
                    Kennedy administration), who was more or less kidnaped by the Russians on the
                    streets of Moscow, and it was quite a cause c�l�bre at the time. I was told by
                    my friends who had access to the information that the Soviets asked Barghoorn
                    repeatedly about me and what I did at the embassy. Well, Barghoorn had never
                    heard of me or seen me, and I was nothing to him, so he couldn't give them any
                    answer. But I took that as a sort of a gratifying sign that the Soviets must
                    think I was much more important than I was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had been in Army Intelligence, though.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: Well, not really. I was in the Army Security Agency, which was electronic
                    intercept stuff. And very low level, at that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But as far as the KGB would be concerned...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: Well, they probably thought so. They probably did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I don't know. I'm just sort of fishing here.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: Probably true, yes. They may have put that together. In any event, they
                    were wrong. For me, “personnel” meant leave cards, not spying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that you had, in the two years...I assume it
                        was exactly two years you were in Moscow...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: Just about, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the stresses and strains and tensions
                        got to you, as many people have said about their tours during those
                        times?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: I don't think so. My wife and I (two of our four children had been born at
                    that time) had a very pleasant time. We remember Moscow most pleasantly.</p>
                <p>There were certain things that happened, that all the old Moscow hands of those
                    days know went on—the surveillance, the wiretaps, even the microwaving of the
                    embassy (which caused us some nervousness later when we found out about it).
                    Those things went on, and it was not a particularly pleasant atmosphere, but the
                    excitement of it and the knowledge that you were doing something really
                    fascinating and important buoyed one up. To serve in Moscow in the early sixties
                    was a privilege and an enjoyment as well, even if the Cold War atmosphere did
                    close in about you at times.</p>
                <p>I would also say that the spirit at the embassy in those days was really very
                    good. We were close to each other. If the Foreign Service ever had a post, it
                    seems to me, where people were fond of each other and enjoyed each other's
                    company and formed a very warm little colony, it was Moscow in the early
                    sixties.</p>
                <p>You have to remember that we went through some trying times. We were there for
                    the Cuban missile crisis. We were there for Kennedy's assassination. And we were
                    there for some spy-trial stuff that caused a great deal of surveillance at the
                    embassy — Penkovsky, the Soviet colonel who was spying for the United States,
                    was arrested while we were there. And the Penkovsky incident caused a lot of us
                    to be declared persona non grata (not me, thank God), and just sort of stirred
                    things up greatly.</p>
                <p>But I guess I would have to say that all in all we found service in Moscow most
                    exciting and most agreeable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'm quite prepared to believe that, but you were
                        there, according to the list of things that you have just laid out, during
                        some very tension-filled times, the Cuban missile crisis, perhaps, above
                        all. Did you notice at the time, then, a perceptible tightening-down of
                        surveillance or other kinds of harassment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: Well, the Cuban missile crisis was an especially interesting time.
                    Needless to say, I was just about the most junior officer at the embassy, and I
                    had no real idea of what was going on. I mean, I wasn't privy to the cables. I
                    know that the cars would go dashing over towards the Soviet Foreign Ministry
                    with messages, and we'd see them go, but I didn't know what was in those
                    messages.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>It's hard to document this, but the feeling that my wife and I and our friends
                    felt was that the Russian people were, by and large, trying to show us Americans
                    that they were our friends and that they did not want war. In a general way,
                    this has always been true. Whenever I've been in the Soviet Union (I have, of
                    course, visited many times), most Russians like Americans and they've generally
                    tried to show it. But during the Cuban missile crisis, I think that we felt a
                    particularly strong feeling that the Russians were trying to communicate to us,
                    in any way they could, that, gosh, we don't want war, and we have nothing
                    against you.</p>
                <p>To give you an example of how you felt this a little bit “in the air,” we had a
                    performing arts attraction that was touring the Soviet Union at the time. As I
                    recall, it was the Shaw Chorale. They had been touring for some time before the
                    Cuban missile crisis, and they were having a successful tour, but not an
                    overwhelming tour. And then all of a sudden the Cuban missile crisis came, and
                    they started getting these tumultuous ovations that would last for ten minutes
                    or so. The embassy officers who were traveling with them (they were out in the
                    boondocks) would call us up and say, “We don't know what's going on; all of a
                    sudden these people have become well loved.” And so our explanation for this is
                    that the Russians were trying to show this American group: “We love you. We
                    don't want to fight you; we love you.” Well, one never knows about those
                    things.</p>
                <p>It was a somewhat tense time, there's no doubt about that. And the Russians did
                    send mobs outside the embassy.</p>
                <p>One of the experiences I'll never forget is that our next-door neighbors in our
                    apartments, which were quite some miles from the embassy, had a governess, whom
                    they had brought with them from British Guiana (now Guyana; then British
                    Guiana). She was very religious, and she had been told that the Russians were
                    atheists, and therefore she was somewhat fearful, and she wouldn't leave the
                    apartment. And our friends, the Woods, kept saying, “You really must go out and
                    enjoy life a little bit.” So, about this time, they had lined up some tickets to
                    go the Bolshoi Ballet, on a Saturday afternoon. They picked the worst possible
                    time, because it was the day that the Russians decided to demonstrate about the
                    Cuban missile crisis. They loaded the governess in the car with their children
                    and the two of them, and they had to come by the embassy to pick up their
                    tickets. And, of course, they drove straight into this mob of several thousand
                    howling Russians. They were able to get out of the car, and all of us at the
                    embassy were taken upstairs to the Marine apartment, which was on the top floor,
                    that being considered the safest place, because people were throwing bottles at
                    the embassy, and so forth. This poor woman from Guiana sat there and trembled
                    for a couple of hours, and after that, I think she more or less refused to leave
                    the apartment.</p>
                <p>This riot, by the way, was the time that has become rather famous because an
                    officer from the embassy went outside and mingled with the crowd and asked
                    somebody, “How long do you think this will last?” And the guy looked at his
                    watch and said, “It's going to be over in twenty-two minutes.”</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: Well, when we first went to Moscow, in the summer, it was Tommy Thompson.
                    Llewellyn Thompson was there on his first tour, and then he went back later. But
                    he left soon after we got there, and the new ambassador was Foy Kohler, who then
                    stayed several years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: The DCM was Jack McSweeney, our first year. The second year, it was Walter
                    Stoessel. And Mac Toon was political counselor. So we had a pretty strong team;
                    with Kohler, Stoessel, and Toon, it was quite a lineup.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Stoessel, rather shockingly and unexpectedly, died not
                        long ago.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: Right. In fact, among old Moscow hands, when we get together, one always
                    brings up things like that —the early deaths of so many of us — and I suppose
                    this is a phenomenon you would expect. But it was documented that the embassy
                    was bombarded with microwaves for a long time by the Soviets. And we always
                    compare notes as to how many of our colleagues died of cancer. And, to us, it
                    always seems that there were large numbers that did so. But, of course, there
                    are large numbers of people everywhere who die of cancer. I will say that Walter
                    was exposed to an awful lot of those microwaves, because the ambassador's office
                    was right up on the top floor, where it was probably pretty bad. So who
                    knows.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's move on to Paris. You were at the NATO mission and
                        then you were at the embassy. And you were there five years, all the time as
                        a political officer. I guess you'd call this mid-level by this time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: I guess so. Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of your duties there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: Well, at NATO, which was then at Port Dauphine, as you know, in Paris, I
                    was on the international staff. I was not in the U.S. delegation; I was on the
                    international staff, and I was supposed to be the Soviet watcher, I suppose you
                    could say. A fascinating time to be there, because I reported for duty in July,
                    and in October, Khrushchev fell. And, of course, the fall of Khrushchev was one
                    of the biggest things in Soviet affairs for a long time.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>I remember very well that there was another fellow on the international staff,
                    whose name was Pierre Cerles, a Frenchman who had served in Moscow not too long
                    before I had. And as soon as Khrushchev was ousted, he took it upon himself to
                    write a memorandum to the secretary general of NATO, because I think he thought
                    he really knew the Soviets much better than I did. It wasn't his job, but he did
                    it, saying that Khrushchev was ousted because of the Sino-Soviet conflict. Well,
                    I wrote my memorandum to the secretary general, saying Khrushchev was ousted for
                    a whole bunch of reasons, including his personality and lots of other things,
                    but it wasn't simply the Sino-Soviet conflict. So I remember the secretary
                    general, Mr. Manlio Brosio, a very wonderful Italian gentleman, who said he had
                    never had two expert reports that were so different. But he took them both and
                    submitted them to the council, and we went on from there.</p>
                <p>That was a very interesting assignment at NATO for two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you moved over to the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: Yes, what happened in the spring of 1966 is that De Gaulle, who was then
                    president of France, declared war, in a political sense, on NATO and on the
                    United States, and decided that France would be better off more independent. And
                    so he took France out of the integrated military part of the alliance. And it
                    became very clear that NATO headquarters should move, which they announced that
                    they would do right away.</p>
                <p>By the way, the recollection that I will never erase of those days is that De
                    Gaulle was having a press conference, which, of course, everyone always watched
                    with bated breath, and it was in the air that he might do something about NATO,
                    so we all went. Of course, De Gaulle spoke in these wonderful phrases that
                    simply rolled out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember very well watching him in the late fifties on
                        the television. It was like listening to Moses making pronouncements.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: Exactly. He just gave out some of the greatest French sentences you'll
                    ever hear. Well, I was not probably the best French speaker in the world, but I
                    was all right by then, and I had sensitive political antennae, and it was very
                    clear to me that he had just said that's the end of it with NATO—to hell with
                    NATO, as it were. And as we walked out, I remember there was a young diplomat
                    from another country, and I'm not even sure what country it was, but he just
                    simply said to me, “Well, there was nothing in that press conference, was
                    there.” He had missed the point.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>At any rate, when NATO decided it would leave Paris, I decided I would leave
                    NATO, and I was fortunate enough to be offered a job in the Political Section at
                    the embassy. Charles Bohlen was our ambassador, and had a great interest in
                    Soviet affairs at the embassy, of course. And so I went down and took the job of
                    sort of the Communist watcher in the Political Section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were there for what, four...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: Three years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's get a little bit operational now. Bohlen was the
                        ambassador, who was the political counselor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: It was Richard Funkhouser.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had the Communist Desk, in a sense. Who were some of
                        your colleagues, if you can recall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: I can remember some of them. John Gunther Dean covered Asia. Peter
                    Sebastian covered Africa. Bob Oakley covered, as I recall, the Middle East;
                    maybe it was South Asia. Peter Semler came along and worked on Germany and
                    Europe. We had Richard Long. Some of these people came and went, of course.
                    Maynard Glitman, who went on to a very successful career in the arms control and
                    military field. But it was a very good bunch; a number went on to be
                    ambassadors.</p>
                <p>Well, of course, working for Chip Bohlen, for someone like myself who had been in
                    Soviet affairs by then for a pretty long time was a great privilege. For me,
                    Chip Bohlen was and is the best diplomat that I ever ran across. I had the
                    greatest respect for him and for his wife, Avis. I couldn't have asked for a
                    better boss, and he knew the Russians so well that it was a real joy to be
                    around him.</p>
                <p>Now during my time in Paris, the way these things happen, Charles Bohlen's tenure
                    ran out and Sarge Shriver came in as his replacement. President Johnson named
                    Shriver. That was my first experience with a political ambassador, and that was
                    quite a different kind of show. It was a totally different embassy, and the
                    Kennedy family style of operation made things really hop.</p>
                <p>So I sometimes think that I had two tours at the embassy in Paris: one under
                    Bohlen and one under Shriver.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, that's interesting that you say that Bohlen was
                        the diplomat par excellence as far as you were concerned. Could you tell us,
                        for the record now and for whoever might be reading this in years to come,
                        what it was about Bohlen, how it is that you formed this assessment of
                        him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: Well, a lot has been written about Chip, and I know in that book The Wise
                    Men, for example, he figures very largely, partly because he represented, I
                    suppose, a whole generation of diplomats. But if you talk about Soviet experts
                    in the American Foreign Service, then surely Bohlen, Kennan, and Llewellyn
                    Thompson would be mentioned by most people as the three greatest. Bohlen was a
                    bona fide Soviet expert, in that he had lived there, he had studied Russia
                    deeply, he spoke Russian really well. He was a marvelous linguist. His French
                    was beautiful to hear, and his Russian I assume was; I never got to hear him
                    speak Russian. But aside from his knowledge, his expertness when it came to
                    Soviet affairs and Russian affairs, he was, of course, a cultivated man. He
                    understood the European mind—the French mind, the European mind—I think, as well
                    as anyone. When Charles Bohlen sat after dinner and talked to the French foreign
                    minister, he was able, intellectually, to hold his own, I think, with any
                    Frenchman—in French, which not too many Americans can do, as you well know.
                    Whenever I think of Chip, I think of that wonderful phrase that they applied to
                    Ben Johnson: “O rare Ben Jonson.” Chip was a rare personality, in that he had a
                    zest for life and a wit that came across as with few other people that I have
                    ever known. A marvelous, marvelous man. When he had his final staff meeting at
                    the embassy, his final words were, “Well, at least you can say I didn't put any
                    cigarettes out in the soup.” And that was sort of typical Bohlen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did he leave? In what year, roughly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: It was either '67 or '68.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever have personal contact with George
                        Kennan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: I just heard him speak and have met him, but no, unfortunately, I never
                    served with him. I had lots of friends that did, but I didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is the assessment of your friends of Kennan as a
                        diplomat?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>PERRY: Well, the things is, George Kennan could write better than most of the
                    rest of us put together. He was and is a marvelous master of the English
                    language, and people always said that when Kennan wrote a telegram to
                    Washington, no matter what he was arguing, you'd be persuaded because the
                    English was just so overwhelming. I don't think that was true of Chip Bohlen,
                    for example, although he wrote beautifully, but he was not the persuasive master
                    that Kennan was. Some people felt — and I don't like to criticize Kennan because
                    he's one of my heroes in many ways — but as a diplomat, some people said that he
                    had a certain messianic complex, that he really felt that he was called to be
                    the one that knew everything and did everything. I don't know whether that's
                    true or not, but it certainly may have entered into the way he departed Moscow,
                    because he was declared persona non grata and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One reason I raise the question is because I just read the
                        book George Kennan, Cold War Iconoclast, by Hixson, who takes a fairly
                        negative view of Kennan, granting him that he writes beautifully and that he
                        was a great raconteur and he was a bone fide Soviet expert and so on and so
                        forth, but Hixson apparently doesn't like him and says words to the effect
                        that he's a prima donna and that he changed his mind every time the wind
                        blew in different directions. Anyway, I just wondered.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: I've heard some of that, but I must say, if you look at his writings,
                    particularly right after the war—the long telegram and the X article and so
                    on—what diplomat do we know that could compare with the effect he had on
                    history? Now you might go back and say, Was he always right? I'm sure he
                    wasn't.</p>
                <p>I was a bit of a dove. I mean, I was a detentenik; I believed in better relations
                    with the Russians. Now that the Cold War is over, you might go back and look at
                    people like me and say, Were they right or were they wrong? Towards the end, in
                    Washington, I remained friends with Bohlen. He would come by the Soviet Desk,
                    where I was then serving, and talk about what was going on in Russia. And I
                    remember we had some differences, because I felt that he was somewhat too
                    ideological in his view of the Soviets, feeling that they were ideologically
                    motivated, which I always doubted, frankly. But, on balance, as far as Bohlen is
                    concerned, he was called a Cold Warrior, but I think most of all he and Kennan
                    both were people that knew the Russians, as a culture, as a civilization, as a
                    people, and that's what gave them their great strength.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's fascinating, not particularly, though, on
                        your career, but on people that you knew. And I think that kind of comment
                        will be of interest for some of our readers.</hi>

                <p>PERRY: One thing I was so fortunate in, I did work for a number of really big
                    people and very interesting people. Working for Chip Bohlen, for me, was sort of
                    like instant history. I mean, Chip had been there; he was at Yalta, and you
                    could ask him, What was Stalin like? and so forth, and this was fascinating. I
                    remember one time I asked for an appointment with him, even though I was on his
                    staff, and I took about an hour of his time, and I said, “Mr. Ambassador, I want
                    to ask you about Yalta, and I'd like for you just to talk to me about it.” I
                    interviewed him, as it were, for about an hour, and I took notes. I've never
                    done anything with those notes; I hope someday I'll find time to. But this was
                    talking to history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went off from Paris and dealing with people like
                        Bohlen and these other really very talented officers, and you went back to
                        Washington for an advanced schooling assignment. What was it exactly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: I spent a year at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
                    Studies (SAIS), in Washington. I had very few responsibilities and was able,
                    thank God, to finish my dissertation, so that I finally got my Ph.D., and just
                    had a year's breather, which was very nice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your topic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: They topic of my dissertation was: Soviet Policy towards French North
                    Africa. To my knowledge, no one has ever read it; even my advisors I don't think
                    ever read it. But it did its purpose, it got me the degree and made me learn how
                    to do research, so it was okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Someone once told me, in that regard: Dissertations are
                        not to be read; they're to be written.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: That's true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is just a hurdle to show that you can find your way
                        around in the stacks in the archives. After SAIS, you were in the
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: Yes, Soviet Desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you what was called then, I guess perhaps still is,
                        desk officer, or office director, or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>PERRY: No, I wasn't that high. I was the head of one part of the Soviet Desk,
                    which was Multilateral Affairs, which means that we dealt with Soviet foreign
                    policy. The Bilateral part of it dealt with U.S.-Soviet relations, and so they
                    got all of the exciting stuff about when somebody was arrested, or when we were
                    going to build a new embassy, or all those bilateral things. Whereas we occupied
                    ourselves with foreign policy.</p>
                <p>I was on the Soviet Desk from 1970 to 1972, and my first boss was Spike Dubs
                    (Adolph Dubs), who was later kidnaped and murdered in Afghanistan. Spike was one
                    of the great Foreign Service officers of my time, I think, and, I've always
                    felt, was a martyr. A wonderful man to work for. I had served briefly with him
                    in Moscow, so I knew him. He was great.</p>
                <p>Then Spike left after my first year on the Soviet Desk, and my next boss was Jack
                    Matlock. Jack and I had served together in Moscow, and in fact I took my first
                    major Soviet trip as an embassy officer with Jack, and we went to the Baltic
                    States, to Riga and Tallinn and Vilnius, and that was wonderful. Jack was my
                    boss, then, for a year before I moved on.</p>
                <p>So I was very fortunate in my bosses on the Soviet Desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he was later ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: He served in Moscow four times and then he was the last ambassador to the
                    Soviet Union. I'm happy to say, Jack is going to come down and speak for me at a
                    conference in November. He's a Duke graduate, you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From 1972 to 1974 you were special assistant to the
                        Director of the Council on Environmental Quality.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: Yes, that was an out-of-service assignment, or whatever you call them, and
                    I think in many ways was the most pleasant assignment I ever had, certainly in
                    the United States. I was never that enamored of Foggy Bottom; I never felt at
                    home in the State Department. This was at the Council on Environmental Quality,
                    which was, and is part of the Executive Office of the President. It was
                    physically located on Lafayette Square, across the street from the White House.
                    My boss, and the chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, was Russell
                    Train, who went on to be head of the Environmental Protection Agency, and then,
                    when he retired from that, became the American head of the World Wildlife
                    Fund—really sort of Mr. Environment. That was a great assignment. And Russ was a
                    splendid boss.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What on earth was an FSO doing on that council?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>PERRY: Well, in the spring of 1972, Richard Nixon went to Moscow and had his
                    first summit with Brezhnev and signed several agreements. One of the many
                    agreements that were signed by Nixon there was an environmental cooperation
                    agreement. I played a small part in helping prepare for that signing, and then
                    Russ Train and the Council were given the job of implementing this agreement,
                    and so I was sent over to help them make this Soviet-American agreement work. I
                    did some other things, too, especially international things, but a lot of what I
                    did the two years I was at the Council had to do with U.S.-Soviet relations. We
                    went on a trip to Moscow in the fall, soon after I joined the Council, and
                    negotiated the agreement that really filled out the umbrella that had been
                    signed by Nixon. We traveled all over the Soviet Union, went out to Lake Baikal
                    and had just a fascinating trip, and then came back and tried to make the thing
                    work. Those were the high tide days both of detente and of the environmental
                    movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you the only FSO in the office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: No, there was one other FSO named Otty Hane, who was also working on
                    international things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, do you know, I think I'm going to call a pause here,
                        because your next three assignments were at a senior level, all overseas
                        again, so I think it's fairly logical point to stop for the moment. The next
                        time we meet, with your permission, we'll go over them, and I'll have some
                        sort of general wrap-up questions I'd like to ask you. Now is there anything
                        that I've forgotten to ask, that you think you would like to speak to on the
                        initial part of this interview?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: No, you know, old FSO's can always dredge up anecdotes about anything, but
                    I don't have anything special I want to tell you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, we'll call this the end of part one of this
                        particular interview.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's October 27, 1992. We're at Chapel Hill, North
                        Carolina, and I'm continuing the second part of an interview with Jack R.
                        Perry. Now, Jack, to continue the second part of this conversation, we
                        dropped you off before you went off to Prague and Stockholm and Sofia and so
                        forth. We were talking about your experiences as a Soviet hand, your
                        experiences in Moscow and the people that you had known, and your experience
                        on the Soviet Desk. But then, after that period, let's say, picking up about
                        1974 in your career, you went off as DCM in Prague. Who was the ambassador
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>PERRY: We had a sort of a strange situation. Shortly before I got there, Bud
                    Sherer (Albert Sherer), a wonderful man, had been named to go over to Geneva for
                    the CSCE talks. But he was not taken away from his ambassadorship, he was just
                    sort of sent over to Geneva, and he would come back to Prague about once a month
                    for a weekend. So, within a couple of weeks after I had arrived, I was charg�
                    d'affaires. And I stayed charg�, except for these occasional monthly weekend
                    visits, for about a year or a little more. Then the CSCE talks were finished,
                    Bud Sherer went off on another assignment, and they didn't send an ambassador to
                    Prague for another year. So I was charg� then for just about a year, until the
                    summer of 1976, when they did send an ambassador. And then I left. So I was
                    charg� most of the two years in Prague.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was the Department so slow in assigning an
                        ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: That's a good question. I was never totally sure. Maybe there was a
                    struggle going on as to whether it would be a career person or non-career or
                    something, but I never got the inside story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, after you had been there virtually two years as
                        charg�, it would be normal practice to shuffle you on off, with a new
                        ambassador coming in, with a little overlap, perhaps. But a new ambassador
                        would have to have his own way prepared or opened for him, and someone who
                        had been charg� for two years would almost have to leave. Did you get that
                        impression? Did anyone say that explicitly to you, the fact that we're going
                        to put you through?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: I don't remember anyone saying it explicitly, but I had very good friends
                    in Personnel, like Arthur Wortzel, and it was just understood from the beginning
                    that I would leave when the ambassador came. We were working on an assignment
                    for me during the spring. I went up to Stockholm to interview with the new
                    ambassador up there, David Smith, and he invited me to come as DCM. So it all
                    sort of worked out. And my wife and I had the joy of two 4th of July
                    celebrations that year. We went to the one in Prague, so we could say goodbye to
                    everybody and introduce people to the new ambassador, on the 4th, and then after
                    the reception, which was midday, we got on the plane and flew to Stockholm, and
                    then they had theirs up there the next day. So by the end of that week we were
                    pretty well basket cases.</p>
                <p>The 4th of July in Prague was, in those bad old days of the Russian occupation,
                    really a big event, because a lot of Czechs could come to the embassy that day,
                    whereas they couldn't have any contact with us the rest of the year. So you had
                    people like alumni of American colleges and universities, and you had veterans
                    who had fought with us in World War II, and all kinds of people who used to be
                    part of the American sort of milieu there in Czechoslovakia who could come. We
                    would have, as I recall, a couple of thousand people. It was a mob, and a very
                    pleasant occasion.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the two years that you were charg�, did you have
                        any issues or problems arise that still linger in your mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: It was a time — the aftermath of the Soviet invasion of 1968 — when not
                    much was going on. As a matter of fact, when we talk about why they didn't send
                    an ambassador the second year, I think one good reason is that it was a very
                    dull, dead period. The Soviet occupation had left us without much to say to the
                    Czechs. And although when you're at an embassy, you always try to make things
                    work and get things going and sign agreements and one thing and another, it was
                    rather hard in that period to put too much push into it. I suppose the main
                    thing that we were trying to do was get some trade going, with trade shows and
                    that sort of thing, but that went nowhere.</p>
                <p>We had one issue that was a burning issue (which in retrospect is very small
                    potatoes, except it had a moral side to it), and that is that we had come into
                    possession of all the Czech gold that had been taken out of Czechoslovakia by
                    Hitler when he took over there at the start of the Second World War. That gold
                    had been in American possession, and I think the British had a little of it, but
                    we had most of it for a long time. And the Czechs had been trying, quite
                    legitimately, to get it back. I mean, they were Communists, but it was still
                    Czechoslovak gold and they should have had it. But we drove a very tough bargain
                    and wanted to get a lot in exchange for giving them their gold back, which I
                    always felt was a sort of a questionable moral enterprise, but that's what we
                    did. And so I spent a fair amount of time trying to talk about that sort of
                    thing.</p>
                <p>About the only other issue that I remember that was a lively one is that I had
                    the idea that it would be nice to celebrate the American part in the liberation
                    of the Czech part of Czechoslovakia from the Germans. While the Russians came
                    sweeping through Slovakia, we Americans, under Patton, went rolling into Bohemia
                    and could have gone easily to Prague, but decided to hold back and let the
                    Russians do that. Patton set up a headquarters near Pilsen, and there were lots
                    of Americans killed liberating the Czech lands. And so we were able to get more
                    attention paid to that, which I thought was a nice thing to do.</p>
                <p>I probably carried it too far, because we got USIA to write a really nice
                    brochure, with illustrations and so forth, all in Czech, which was sort of a
                    celebration of the American role in liberating Czechoslovakia. Well, of course,
                    that was anathema to the Russians; they didn't want to hear that at all. And it
                    was therefore anathema to the Czech government. But we issued that brochure and
                    started handing it out. And, of course, I was called in for a protest, and the
                    Czechs got terribly upset about that. So, after a while, we had to quit
                    distributing it, because it was causing too many problems. But it got around in
                    good quantity. I was proud of it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was their objection?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: Their objection was that it was propaganda, and that the real liberation
                    of Czechoslovakia came from the Russians and not from us. They distorted
                    history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You dealt with the Czech government officials; you didn't
                        deal directly with Russian officials while there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: No, except that the Soviet Embassy had some pretty intelligent people
                    there, people that we could occasionally talk to, although not about what was
                    going on in Czechoslovakia; they wouldn't talk about that. But it was a certain
                    dialogue about what was going on in the world. Otherwise, no, we dealt with the
                    Czechs as if they were a totally sovereign nation. Of course, they weren't
                    totally sovereign what with all those Soviet troops there and the rest of it.
                    But that was the way that we (and they) acted. And I had occasion, as charg�, to
                    meet all of the top Czech officials. Hus�k was then the head of the Party and
                    the head of the government, and I had a number of occasions to meet him and
                    other people. But, of course, as you would imagine, we didn't have that much
                    high-level stuff going on. We didn't have really high-level visitors, nor did
                    they go to the U.S. So we dealt mostly with our colleagues in the Foreign
                    Ministry at a working level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would deal with the foreign minister, as charg�, or
                        the deputy foreign minister, or who exactly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: I had some contact with all of them. Prague is not that big a place, and
                    there were times when I would see the foreign minister, or some of his deputies.
                    Some of the deputy foreign ministers I talked to a good deal. But it was the
                    head of the American section that we dealt with the most from day to day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went to Sweden, and the ambassador was
                        Strausz-Hup�.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: No, he had just left, just before. It was a gentleman named David Smith,
                    who was a Republican appointee and a Washington lawyer, who served really only
                    about a year, because you had, then, in 1976, the Ford-Carter election, and so
                    he was invited to leave after those elections, and a new Democratic ambassador
                    came in, Rodney Kennedy-Minott.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kennedy-Minott, who was from Cal State. Did you just stay
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>PERRY: I just stayed on. There never seemed to be much talk about my leaving.
                    Rodney and I got along quite well, as I did with David Smith, I will say. They
                    were both very pleasant.</p>
                <p>Rodney and his wife had been among the first Californians to get on the Carter
                    bandwagon. They had given breakfasts for Carter when he was still unknown in
                    California. Don't ask me why, except I will say (I remember this, being a
                    Southerner myself) that Rodney was a great fan of the South. He was a historian
                    and thought it would be a great thing to have a Southern president again—bring
                    the South back into the mainstream and so forth. At any rate, he and his wife
                    were part of the Carter team early on, and he was particularly close to Hamilton
                    Jordan; I think they were pretty good friends. And so he got named. He and I hit
                    it off well. I had been charg� for several months, between ambassadors, so when
                    he came, it was natural for me to take him around and introduce him and all
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it might have been natural for him to seek his own
                        man as DCM..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: I think once Rodney found out that I could be a friend and that I wasn't
                    trying to do him in in any way but was trying to help him, we got along quite
                    well. I really liked him and still like him, and I liked his wife a great deal;
                    she was a very classy person. They had some fine traits.</p>
                <p>Like many non-career ambassadors, he tended (and so did David Smith, and so had
                    others I had worked with before) not to take diplomatic protocol and courtesies
                    as seriously as we career people did. And so I had trouble getting him and his
                    predecessor to make courtesy calls on other ambassadors and so forth. And it
                    bothered me, because they would come up to me at a party and say, “Your
                    ambassador's been here X months and he hasn't been to see me yet.” And I'd say,
                    “Well, I'm sure he's coming soon.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “He hasn't even dropped cards on me.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you still have at that time embassy officers dropping
                        cards on the ambassador when he arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: No, I think, at least in Stockholm and other places that I served, it had
                    pretty well faded by then. We did that when I first went into the Foreign
                    Service, and we did it in our earlier posts, in Moscow and in Paris, but then
                    somehow it withered away.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember very well being required to do it at my early
                        posts, too. It struck me as quite unusual, but you go along with it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: Sure, and those cards cost a fortune to a junior officer. Every time I
                    turned around I was buying two hundred new cards.</p>
                <p>There are two things about Sweden that stick in my mind particularly. One is what
                    a lovely place it was to serve. I mean, I honestly fell very much in love with
                    Sweden, considered it a second homeland, and have always thought that, if I
                    could afford it, I'd love to live there, at least part of the year. Just a
                    lovely place. And the second thing is that we came not long after the Vietnam
                    War — when you think about it, we got there in 1976, and Swedish-American
                    relations had been really sour. I mean, you know how the Swedes had been holier
                    than everybody on Vietnam, and wouldn't speak to us very much, and we had had a
                    lot of trouble, although we did have an ambassador there during the Vietnam War
                    named Holland, who was a political appointee. He had enormous respect for the
                    Swedes, as did they for him. I never heard, in my two years in Sweden, anything
                    but the utmost praise for him and how he served during the Vietnam War with
                    dignity and all the rest of it. But what was peculiar was that by the time we
                    got there, in 1976, not long after the Vietnam War at all, the Swedes were quite
                    ready to forget Vietnam and to start improving relations with the United States,
                    almost overnight. And so I was there in sort of a halcyon period when we had no
                    serious problems with the Swedes; everything was good.</p>
                <p>The Social Democrats got voted out of office while we were there, for the first
                    time in thirty-odd years, and what they called the bourgeois parties came in for
                    a couple of years. So that was an unusual period, too. But it made serving
                    there, I must say, an enormous pleasure. I had friends on both sides of the
                    political spectrum, and liked and respected them all.</p>
                <p>I think the second day that I was in Stockholm, one of the embassy officers took
                    me over to the Foreign Ministry and took me around and introduced me to
                    everybody except the foreign minister. (I didn't meet him that day, but I met
                    everybody else that mattered.) And every one of them was a first name—it was
                    “Jack” this and “Leif” that and all the rest of it. And for two years, I was on
                    a first-name basis with everybody that mattered in foreign policy in Sweden, and
                    it was such an enjoyment. And they all spoke better English than I did, so it
                    was great.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were afflicted with a Georgia accent, but I
                        imagine you knew all the words.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: I knew the words.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any particular reason why they were being so
                        forthcoming?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>PERRY: Well, I think Sweden, of course, could benefit from association with the
                    United States in all kinds of ways—military and diplomatic and all the rest of
                    it. They wanted to be closer to us. And the shadow of the Russian bear was a
                    pretty dark shadow at that time.</p>
                <p>We had a bit of a setback while I was there. I always thought that it was an
                    unfortunate decision. Just as an example of the kind of thing that was going on,
                    they were trying to sell their fighter aircraft, the Viggen, to India. A lot of
                    the components of it were American components, and therefore we had a veto on
                    whom they could sell it to. And we didn't want them to sell it to the Indians.
                    This was during the Carter administration, and it went against our, I guess we
                    would have called it, human rights policy, or our arms escalation policy. I
                    think the idea was, if they got it, then the Pakistanis would notch-up their
                    fighter and so forth; it would escalate the danger. The fact was, if they didn't
                    buy the Swedish plane, they were going to buy a French plane, which was every
                    bit as good. And so that was one of those times when we at the Embassy really
                    fought and did our best with Washington to get them to see that this was a case
                    where it would hurt nothing and it would help the Swedes a whole heck of a lot.
                    But we lost it. I think Cy Vance, who was then secretary of state, decided that
                    one himself, and I'm sure he had good reasons for it. But that's the sort of
                    thing that we got into.</p>
                <p>Another thing that I remember about service in Stockholm, that, since you're an
                    old FSO, would amuse you, I suspect: the relationship between the ambassador and
                    CIA was very interesting at this time.</p>
                <p>And that was because, under the former ambassador, Strausz Hup�, there had been
                    one of those rare times when CIA blossomed into the press. They had recruited in
                    Stockholm an African (I think he was Kenyan, but I'm not sure; it was before my
                    time, of course), and they were going to use him as a source. And after a little
                    while, he blew the whistle on them and went public. It was very embarrassing to
                    Strausz Hup� and to the embassy that we Americans were out recruiting Africans
                    on Swedish soil to spy for the CIA. So it left a bad taste in everybody's
                    mouth.</p>
                <p>And so the new ambassador, David Smith, was almost fanatical that he didn't want
                    to be embarrassed by CIA. And, since he was new to diplomacy and really didn't
                    know much about how to do this, he asked me, as his DCM, to sort of take hold of
                    CIA in Stockholm and make sure he wasn't blindsided.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's easier said than done.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: Easier said than done, to make sure that he knew everything that CIA was
                    doing.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Well, there was an acting station chief, who, as a matter of fact, I had known in
                    Moscow and who was a very decent chap, who, I suspect, came relatively clean
                    with us. At any rate, we went down to the secure room (the Tank) and met, quite
                    a few times, and he went through, he told us, every case that they had going in
                    Sweden, by name...well, maybe not every one by name, most of them by name, who
                    it was, what was going on, the whole story, so that the ambassador would not be
                    surprised or upset by anything that should happen. And the commitment was made
                    that they would keep on with this kind of openness with the ambassador.</p>
                <p>Well, I'm not in a position to say how much they told us. And the new station
                    chief, when he came in, was much more of an old-line CIA type that didn't like
                    this thing at all; this openness was really anathema to him. So we had a lot of
                    conflict then, and I suspect that we were never told as much as we thought we
                    were.</p>
                <p>But, for me, it was a very interesting experience, trying to get CIA to tell us
                    everything they were doing in Stockholm. It was fascinating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this will be of interest not only to me, as you
                        remarked, but to the historian, the student of diplomatic affairs, who reads
                        the transcript of these tapes some day. Were you reasonably satisfied that
                        you were seeing all of the outgoing from the station?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: I was never satisfied about that, because, as you well know, most of the
                    communicators at the embassies I've worked in were CIA, or at least a lot of
                    them were, and I just never felt that we were seeing all the messages — although
                    the ambassador asserted his right to see everything that was going out. And I
                    know, in some embassies, ambassadors, by God, succeeded in doing that. I don't
                    think we did, partly because, you see, the ambassador was using me as his voice,
                    and it was hard for me to talk as tough as a career ambassador could have
                    talked. So I'm not satisfied that we saw everything. Or knew everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you reasonably satisfied that you were privy to the
                        information in all of their caseloads, in all of their futzing about in
                        the...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: Well, I guess, being a Soviet type in the Foreign Service, I had an awful
                    lot of dealings with CIA, particularly the analysts' side, the open side. I
                    always had great admiration for the analysts who were covering Soviet affairs,
                    and I thought they had some very good people, of a relatively liberal bent, if I
                    may use that word 'liberal' in a nonpolitical sense. But I always had great
                    hesitations about the non-open side, about the operational side. And, although I
                    had some friends who were in there, I always thought that they never told us
                    everything. In Stockholm, and also, I will say, when I was charg� in Prague, I
                    had very good relations with the CIA people, but I'm not at all sure that they
                    told everything.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Stockholm was an interesting place because it was a center of terrorism—terrorism
                    in a sense that the Swedes were notably lax on cracking down on terrorism,
                    especially until they had had a couple of incidents themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was as self-protection, perhaps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: I think it may have been. Remember, I got there soon before Prime Minister
                    Olaf Palme was ousted from office, although he came back after my time. I think
                    that the Social Democrats might have just been a little more willing to put up
                    with some things than some other governments in Europe were.</p>
                <p>But at any rate, CIA considered that they were somewhat coddling terrorists and
                    letting them take a free R&amp;R in Stockholm and then go out and do their dirty
                    work elsewhere. I don't know how true that was; I'm not enough of an expert, and
                    I wasn't inside enough to know.</p>
                <p>But what it did mean is that the work that CIA did in Stockholm, on the terrorist
                    side particularly, was important. And that was an era, in the seventies, when
                    there was a lot of ugly terrorist stuff going on, some really bad incidents, in
                    Europe particularly. And so CIA did have some cases that they were running that
                    were potentially of great value. Whether they told all of them to the ambassador
                    or not, I really don't know.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you a slightly different question. Were there
                        any American exiles still around, those who had fled the war, the draft and

                </p>
                <p>PERRY: There were, and I would occasionally hear a little bit about them.
                    President Ford made his offer of amnesty while I was there, but at that time, so
                    soon after the war, people didn't just flock to take advantage of that offer. As
                    I recall, it was extended again later. There were some there, but the embassy
                    heard of them and got involved with them, during my time at least, rather
                    little.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PERRY: Well, I went home for a brief thing first. I was deputy executive
                    secretary of the state department for a year. The reason that I mention that is,
                    that was, in a way, the most interesting assignment I had, because I worked very
                    closely with Cy Vance, whom I admire greatly as a really a major, impressive
                    figure. He reminded me always of an ancient Roman senator. I mean, he was really
                    an upright man, in the best sense of the word. And I think what he's done since
                    he left as secretary of state bears that out. He has really been a man who has
                    done great good in the world. After all, he was one of the very few people who
                    resigned as secretary of state over an issue of conscience. I admire him a great
                    deal, and I enjoyed working for him immensely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is not my interview, but I'll make a comment here.
                        There's a type—the Eastern establishment internationalist and intellectual,
                        and Vance is perhaps an excellent personification of the type.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: I think he is. Being from Georgia myself, and therefore having a certain
                    rapport with some of the Carter staff people, and knowing the people over on
                    Brzezinski's staff very well, I felt a little bit as if I could see both sides
                    of the famous Vance versus Brzezinski quarrel.</p>
                <p>But I will have to say, in retrospect, when I was deputy executive secretary,
                    Peter Tarnoff was executive secretary, and Frank Wisner was the other deputy, so
                    the three of us were the ones who were running the executive secretariat—Peter
                    especially, of course. Peter was very close to Mr. Vance and was really part of
                    a little Mafia operation there that was really running the State DepartmenReally
                    first-rate people—Les Gelb and Tony Lake and Bill Maynes and Peter and a few
                    others, really good people. Good people whether you agreed with all of their
                    politics or not, and I happened to agree.</p>
                <p>But Mr. Vance was caught in an unpleasant situation, in which Brzezinski played a
                    large role. I've always found it hard to forgive this totally. Zbig is a
                    brilliant man, one of the most brilliant men that has been in foreign affairs in
                    this country, I think. And yet he didn't play the game by the rules that he
                    should have, it seems to me, as national security advisor. And it made it just
                    terribly difficult for Mr. Vance. I was only there for a year in that job and
                    would be the last person to claim that I had any special insights, but it seems
                    to me that Mr. Vance was in a very, very difficult position.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>His conscience was such that, during the three years that he was secretary of
                    state, he got there in the office before almost anybody else in the building; he
                    left usually among the last (he didn't go to parties and cocktails and things
                    like that); and he was in every weekend, as far as I know. I'm sure he must have
                    taken one weekend off during his secretaryship, but they were very rare. I was
                    many years younger, but he worked himself so hard that I couldn't keep up at
                    all; he wore me out and I think those who were closer around him than I.</p>
                <p>But I remember particularly, as an example of his conscience, a terrible time
                    when we were going to Mexico with the president, when Carter was making a state
                    visit to Mexico. And just at this time, some of our Foreign Service people were
                    taken hostage. If I'm not confusing the incidents, I'm pretty sure it was about
                    this time that my old friend and colleague Spike Dubs was taken prisoner and was
                    murdered, actually, in Kabul. I remember that Mr. Vance was so hurt by that
                    incident and felt so strongly that he had lost a friend and one of his people,
                    that you could see it etched on his face. And I remember when we got to Mexico,
                    I think that particular day some hostages had been taken elsewhere, and I think
                    it was in Pakistan, I think that was the time. (It was before the hostages were
                    taken at the embassy in Tehran). But, at any rate, he had been up for about two
                    nights, worrying about these various things, Spike Dubs's murder and these
                    hostages and so forth, and his face was somewhat grey. And I remember talking to
                    Mr. Vance with Arnie Raphel, who was later ambassador to Pakistan and also,
                    alas, was murdered, or the plane crashed and he was killed. Arnie was Vance's
                    personal aide, and Arnie and I were talking to him, trying to persuade him not
                    to go to the state dinner that night, because he was so tired it looked as if he
                    was about to fall on his face. But he would not hear of it. I mean, he said,
                    “Oh, no, I have to be there.” So he went, and did without sleep another
                    night.</p>
                <p>Mr. Vance was a tremendously impressive man, both his mind and his character, and
                    I stand in great respect for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That kind of comment, too, will be of great interest to
                        those who read these transcripts, sooner or later, one of these days. Tell
                        me, briefly, what does the deputy executive secretary of the department
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: Well, the S/S, or the Executive Secretariat, is the paper-pushing
                    enterprise on the Seventh Floor that funnels all of the flow of paper from the
                    Department to the secretary and back, into the other principals, but especially
                    the secretary. The executive secretary is the guy really responsible for the
                    fusion of the secretary of state and the rest of the building.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>And I must say here that I feel something very strongly, that I'm sure historians
                    will be investigating and writing about for years, but we've had two different
                    types of secretaries of state in my lifetime. There were those who used the
                    building, who used the Foreign Service, who used the floors under them, and
                    those who didn't. And the ones who did especially, it seems to me, for some
                    reason, were mostly Democrats. I don't think it has anything to do with the
                    party, but it just works that way, in history, for some reason. But I think Mr.
                    Rusk was one who used the building, and I think Mr. Vance was, preeminently.
                    Some others as well, but those two especially. Whereas those who did not use the
                    building and were famous for being hermits up on the Seventh Floor and relying
                    on a handful of chosen people and not telling the rest of the building what was
                    going on were Kissinger and Baker, preeminent among those. I don't think Shultz
                    was so much that way, and you could name others, but I think Kissinger and Baker
                    were. Well, as a Foreign Service officer, I feel that's a damn shame, because
                    we've got this great body of expertness, as you well know, and willingness to
                    serve, and when one is cut out by the secretary of state as if one's work didn't
                    matter, then it hurts, and I don't think that you get the best foreign policy
                    that way, either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it's a waste, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: A great waste. Great waste.</p>
                <p>But, at any rate, Mr. Vance was one who used the building, so your question: What
                    did the executive secretary do? I'm not sure that the same answer would obtain
                    for the Baker time or the Kissinger time, not nearly as much. But I think Mr.
                    Vance did use the building, and Peter Tarnoff and Frank Wisner and I were the
                    ones who would call up the assistant secretary or his staff member and would
                    say, “The secretary needs a briefing paper on this. He's going to lunch with the
                    president Friday; he's got to have a paper on this,” and so forth. And then it
                    all flowed in and out; we were drowned in paper, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you also have to do the logistical arrangements for a
                        trip abroad, for example?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: Well, we did a lot of it. During my time there, there were four or five.
                    During the one year I was there, there were several big ones. Usually you got a
                    lot of help from Protocol and from the regional bureau in charge, like ARA for
                    the Mexico trip and so forth, but we in S/S did a fair amount of that.</p>
                <p>And also we were responsible for all of the secret traffic and all of the
                    high-level CIA papers that came in—all the stuff that was “Eyes-only” and all
                    that, that was a rather big responsibility.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Another responsibility that I think is important is that we prepared “the evening
                    reading.” Every president does it differently, but during the Carter
                    administration there was something called “the evening reading,” which was
                    supposed to be a first-person thing from Vance to Carter. I think when the
                    administration started, it probably was largely first person, but time ran out
                    for Mr. Vance to write the thing, and so it became less personal. But it was
                    very high level, and we in the Executive Secretariat really wrote that thing
                    every night, with a lot of help from people around the building. Now this was
                    not the INR (Intelligence and Research) briefing; that was good, too, but this
                    was “what's happened today that the secretary of state wants the president to
                    know about.” And it was a very important medium for reaching Mr. Carter on
                    foreign affairs. It would come back every day with little scrawls from Carter,
                    saying “okay,” or “do this,” or “do that,” and one of our jobs was to scan that
                    thing, and if there were decisions, to pass them down.</p>
                <p>Allied to that was — once again, every president had his own version of this —
                    the Friday lunch. Carter had a “Friday lunch” with the secretary of state and,
                    sometimes, I think, the vice president and secretary of defense, sometimes the
                    head of CIA and so forth, and Brzezinski, the NSC advisor. And our job was to
                    prepare for Mr. Vance the agenda and the briefing papers for that lunch, an
                    important task.</p>
                <p>I remember those luncheon things so well because Mr. Vance struggled mightily,
                    the year that I was working there, to get things like Third-World debt and
                    environmental issues and issues like that on the agenda. And invariably we would
                    have these marvelous papers on these broad subjects like that, that would come
                    from the building, problems that just needed to be brought to the president's
                    attention—long-range problems, environmental problems and that sort of thing.
                    And every Friday, invariably, there would be so many crises that they would get
                    bumped. And they would get bumped time and time again. And so you put the
                    Iranian hostages first, and then you put threatened war in the Middle East, and
                    all the rest of it, and the long-range problems never got looked at. And I have
                    a feeling that that's the story of how it operates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Still today, probably.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know how you got chosen to go to Sofia,
                        Bulgaria?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>PERRY: I think so. Being chosen as deputy executive secretary was a sign that
                    there was some confidence in me and that I had good friends who were in fairly
                    influential places. When I went to State, I told Peter that, on the advice of my
                    predecessor, David Anderson, who went off as ambassador to Yugoslavia, a year in
                    S/S would probably be enough. And Peter was kind enough to agree to that. I
                    think, by the time a year was over, I was worn out, and he was glad that I had
                    finished my year and he could get somebody else in there anyway. It was a hard
                    year, and I'm not so sure that I was as well cut out for that as people like
                    Peter Tarnoff and Frank Wisner, who, I must say, had lightning-fast minds and
                    whom I respected a great deal. They could do the policy-decision process in a
                    way that I'm not sure I was cut out for. I think I was much better at an embassy
                    than I was in the State Department. At any rate, a year was enough.</p>
                <p>When there was going to be a meeting to decide ambassadors, the three of
                    us—Peter, Frank, and I—would meet before, and we would have the list, and we
                    would discuss the State Department people that would go up. Now, of course, we
                    knew nothing about the politicos that were coming from the other side that would
                    go directly to the White House. But we did know who in Personnel they were
                    putting up for ambassador, and we had some voice in it. Peter Tarnoff
                    particularly had a big voice, and we sort of advised him; we would occasionally
                    know people that he wouldn't know. I'm not saying that he went against
                    Personnel, but he was able to influence largely what Personnel did.</p>
                <p>And so I guess that with my Soviet background and having been DCM at a couple of
                    posts and charg� a good deal and all of that, it was considered that I was old
                    enough for the thing. And so what was available? Well, Bulgaria was available.
                    EUR (the European Bureau) was always my home bureau, and it's where I'd served
                    all of my posts, and so it was natural that that's where I would find an
                    ambassadorship if I found one. And I could claim a little experience in
                    communist countries.</p>
                <p>I remember that Harry Barnes, who was then director general, said, “Jack, don't
                    go to Bulgaria. Wait and get something bigger and better.” Because that was
                    probably, I guess, maybe except for Malta, the last and the least of the
                    European ambassadorial posts. But I said to myself, and I said to my wife, and I
                    said to Harry, “You know, Washington is a funny place. One never knows what will
                    happen about these things, and six months from now I may be dead or
                    something.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or you may have blotted your copybook.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: Exactly. So I said, “Listen, if I have a chance at Bulgaria, I'm going to
                    take it.” And I did. And I've never been sorry.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jack, I hate to say this, but I think we're going to have
                        to schedule a third meeting somewhere along the line, because there is a
                        certain amount of time that these things are useful and there's a certain
                        amount of tape that runs out, believe it or not. So I would just as soon
                        hold, if you don't mind, a couple of overview questions that I'd like to ask
                        you, and a survey of your service in Sofia. I'd like to hold it for a little
                        later. There's an unusual opportunity here, I think, for you to be able to
                        compare and contrast service with political ambassadors, because you had two
                        or three in a row there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: I had Sarge Shriver in Paris, too. That was educational.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even though these were relatively small posts, you had, at
                        least a couple of them there, political appointee ambassadors, and then
                        almost, not quite, almost immediately you go off, as a careerist yourself,
                        as an ambassador, and a certain number of years have passed, so you're able
                        to see with some objectivity the advantages and the disadvantages that the
                        two types of fish of ambassadors have been. I'd like to pursue that a little
                        bit at another time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: It's a good subject. I would also be glad to have an opportunity, if you
                    decide that you have the time to ask me, to talk a little bit about Dean Rusk,
                    because since leaving the Foreign Service, mostly, I have had a great deal of
                    contact with him, and it would be fun to talk a little bit about it, especially
                    as compared with Cy Vance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would be, I think, invaluable for the future
                        historian. These tapes, as you know, are destined for the perusal of future
                        historians, historians perhaps a generation from now, ten to twenty years
                        from now or whatever, and so those of us who have some direct knowledge of
                        historic figures, such as Dean Rusk, especially, who really, for the young
                        historian nowadays, I suppose, seems like ancient history, it would be
                        really quite unusual to have a chance to get your views on that. Would you
                        please remind me about that when we talk again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: Sure, okay. I will.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My mind is like a steel sieve.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERRY: I like to talk about Dean Rusk, because he's one of my heroes, so I will
                    be glad to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This particular cassette I'm going to send in for
                        transcription, because it takes quite a while anyway, as I understand it,
                        but with the understanding that we're going to hit another tape somewhere
                        along the line.</hi>

                <p>PERRY: Sure. It will give me an excuse to come back up to Chapel Hill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very good. I appreciate your time. We will just call it
                        quits at this point, and we'll pick up again on another date.</hi>
