                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know you came into the Foreign Service in 1965, but why
                        don't you tell us a little about where you grew up, your education, and what
                        brought you to the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: I was born in 1940 in St. Louis, Missouri and, with the exception of one
                    year in Portland, Oregon during the war years (my father worked out there),
                    lived there until 1947 when my family moved to California. In 1947-48, we moved
                    to several places in the Los Angeles area before finally settling down in Long
                    Beach, California. I was in the third grade then. We stayed in Long Beach until
                    my high school years when we moved to Los Alamitos in Orange County. I attended
                    St. Anthony's Grammar School and later St. Anthony's High School in Long Beach,
                    where I graduated in 1958. That same year I enrolled at the University of
                    California at Berkeley, graduating in 1962 with a BA in Political Science. At
                    that time, Reserve Officer Training (ROTC) was mandatory at Berkeley (at least
                    for my first two years there). Knowing that I was likely to be drafted upon
                    completion of college, I chose to take four years of ROTC and was commissioned a
                    Second Lieutenant in 1962.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the Army?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes, I was a Lieutenant in Army Intelligence. Before entering the Army, I
                    obtained a deferment to go to law school. In the fall of 1962, I entered Boalt
                    Hall Law School at the University of California at Berkeley. Unfortunately, from
                    day one, I hated the study of law. I was unhappy and decided that Boalt was not
                    right for me. Over the Christmas holiday I decided to quit law school and asked
                    the Army to call me up for active duty as soon as possible. I entered the Army
                    in February 1963 for a two-year tour of duty. Training occupied the first six
                    months of my tour. I went first to the Infantry Officer's School at Fort
                    Benning, Georgia since at that time Army Intelligence was a Reserve Branch, and
                    it was necessary to be trained first in one of the combat arms. I chose
                    Infantry. After nine weeks at Fort Benning, I went north to Fort Holabird in
                    Baltimore, Maryland for Counterintelligence training. After four months of
                    training there, I was assigned to the Presidio of San Francisco for the
                    remaining eighteen months of my Army tour.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>During my first week back in California, I met my future wife Jill at a party in
                    Berkeley. She was a senior in the University, but I did know her during my
                    undergraduate days. We began dating in the fall of 1963 and were married in
                    September 1964, while I was still in the Army. I served in the Intelligence
                    Section of the Sixth Army, which had its headquarters at the Presidio of San
                    Francisco. The head of the Section was Colonel Al Hoffman, who had been Military
                    Attach� in Thailand and thus was knowledgeable about the Foreign Service. Midway
                    through my tour he asked me what I was going to do after the Army, and I told
                    him I had not really given it a lot of thought. He said, “Why don't you take the
                    Foreign Service exam?” I thought that sounded interesting because I remember
                    taking courses at Berkeley in American foreign policy, but I never thought I
                    could pass the State Department exams. So I had not considered the diplomatic
                    service a realistic career possibility. But I went ahead and took the written
                    exam and, to my surprise, passed it, and then.....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Took it in San Francisco?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes, in San Francisco, and then in the fall of 1964 I took the oral exams
                    and I passed them as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Took those also in San Francisco?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: In San Francisco, right. And then we had to endure a long waiting process
                    before I actually entered the Foreign Service. Jill and I lived moderately well
                    on my Lieutenant's salary, but those paychecks stopped in February 1965. So I
                    had to find some way to make financial ends meet. I accepted an offer to be a
                    paid Research Assistant in the Political Science Department of San Francisco
                    State, where I had taken some graduate courses at night. I had no intention of
                    working for an advanced degree, but I could not be certain wheand iI would join
                    the Foreign Service. To hedge my bets and while I was still in the Army, I
                    contacted the CIA to see about their officer program. The Agency was quick to
                    respond, perhaps because of my Intelligence experience. In any event, I took the
                    CIA entry examination. Their process went very quickly. In February or March of
                    1965, I went to Langley for the Agency's three grueling days of psychological
                    and other tests. I did not know at the time whether I had passed, but just two
                    weeks after returning to California I was offered a position in the CIA. I asked
                    Agency officials if I could defer entry until the fall of 1965. I wanted some
                    additional time to let the State Department process run its course. The CIA
                    agreed. Jill did not like the idea of my joining the CIA, but we were running
                    out of options and money. Finally, in June I received notification that the
                    Department had completed all the processing and I was asked if I would like to
                    compete for the August 1965 class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>DEAL: Yes, the Foreign Service. And so I wrote back “Yes, I'd like to compete”
                    and then a few weeks later I received notice that I was accepted for that
                    particular class. I declined the CIA offer. And so that is how I came to the
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is your oral history interview and not mine but
                        I'll just comment that my family moved from Cleveland, Ohio to Berkeley when
                        I was seven years old and I grew up in California also (in Berkeley and then
                        Santa Cruz). But I didn't go to the University of California and I didn't
                        have any discussions with CIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Ok, so you entered the State Department, the Foreign Service, did the A-100
                    introductory course beginning in 1965, which I think innumerable people in this
                    program have discussed. I don't know if there's anything you particularly want
                    to say about your experience with the orientation course.</p>
                <p>DEAL: I thought it was kind of “bare-bones” at the time, but in many respects,
                    since I didn't have that much knowledge about the inner-workings of the Foreign
                    Service and the State Department, I thought it was a reasonable introduction to
                    the work. And language training followed that......</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what language training did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Spanish, because in the A-100 course I was assigned to Tegucigalpa,
                    Honduras. The reason I chose Latin America (or at least a Spanish-speaking post)
                    was because, at that time the Department did not send first-tour officers to the
                    Communist world, which was my area of interest, especially Eastern Europe. I
                    also had some doubts about my language ability and had taken some Spanish in
                    college so I thought that would be the easier course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you received a proficiency level 3/3 when you finished
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: No, not at the time. I received my 3/3 proficiency during my first year in
                    Honduras, actually a few months after my arrival.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And in Honduras and Tegucigalpa, I see that you were in
                        the central complement rotation; did you do mainly consular work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>DEAL: I started off with a four-month assignment in the Consular Section. The
                    program was designed to give entering officers some experience in and exposure
                    to all the major sections of the Embassy. After my tour in the Consular Section,
                    I moved over to AID [United States Agency for International Development],
                    working for the program director for a four-month period. I'm not sure whose
                    idea that was, but it was an interesting excursion since I could see up close
                    what AID did. I learned quite a bit about the development aspects of their
                    programs and the economic work associated with them. That experience helped me
                    when I moved into the Embassy's Economic Section.</p>
                <p>After the tour in AID, I went to the Administrative Section where I was acting
                    Personnel Officer for about three months. During that time, the Department
                    announced that it was ending the central complement program and first-tour
                    officers would be moving into regular positions. I subsequently received notice
                    that I was being assigned to a consular position in Merida, Mexico. That would
                    have been in 1967.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would have been a direct transfer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes, but there was a vacancy in the Economic Section....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Tegucigalpa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: In Tegucigalpa. And that seemed to me a more interesting possibility. Jill
                    was pregnant at that time so the assignment for both personal and professional
                    reasons seemed a good choice. I moved into the Economic Section after completion
                    of my administrative tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you entered the Service in 1965, were you given a
                        career “cone” at entry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: I don't recall if we were given a cone. If anything, I would have wanted to
                    be a political officer. That was my academic background and interest. I don't
                    know if there was such a program then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't remember what year that started.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: I don't either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because you certainly were an Economic Officer later on,
                        but we can talk about that as we go ahead. So you finished out your tour in
                        Tegucigalpa in the Economic Section?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>DEAL: Yes, I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there about a year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: It was probably about 15 months in the Economic Section. The Department
                    added a few months to my original two-year tour of duty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it was a two-man section, you said?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you did commercial work, as well as economics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: I did some commercial work because there was only one officer in the
                    Commercial Attach�'s office, so I filled in for him on a number of occasions.
                    Also, because the Consular Section had only one officer, I did consular work
                    while the Consul was gone (and he was gone a lot). So I shuttled back and forth
                    between the Economic and Commercial Sections and the Consulate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like a pretty good first assignment in the sense
                        that you had the chance to do several different things, have some
                        responsibility (being “acting” this and that); is that how you would
                        feel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: I thought so. I must say the embassy was very good to me in the sense that
                    I was their first central complement officer, so they had devised an interesting
                    program of rotation. Because of my assignment to a permanent position in the
                    Economic Section, I did not rotate to the Political Section. Still, I saw how a
                    mid-sized embassy in that part of the world functioned, and I believe I gained a
                    lot from the experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other junior officers at post or were you the
                        only one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: No, there was one who followed me, an officer named Ray Pardon with whom I
                    became close friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Followed you in the sense that you were still there?</hi>
                </p>

                <p>DEAL: Yes, he was assigned to post as a central complement officer, but he too
                    was caught up in the program change, and he spent most of his tour in the
                    Political Section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Ambassador at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Joseph John Jova was the Ambassador the whole time I was there. Jean
                    Wilkowski was Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do in the Economic Section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: I did basic economic reporting. In addition, we helped with the economic
                    analysis of AID program documents since they did not have their own economists.
                    In terms of economic reporting, I did unearth a scandal involving illegal
                    exports of coffee. At that time, the U.S. was a party to the International
                    Coffee Agreement. Honduran producers were engaged in illegal trafficking of
                    coffee contrary to the agreement, which we discovered and which was confirmed by
                    other posts in the region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I worked for Jean Wilkowski a little later in Rome in the
                        early '70's (not too much later) and I seem to recall her describing vividly
                        a soccer war between Honduras and what, El Salvador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes, that was after my time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DEAL: But it did tell you something about the nature of politics in that region,
                    namely, that you could go to war over a soccer match. Of course, the root cause
                    of that war stemmed from the traditional animosity between Honduras and El
                    Salvador, with the Hondurans strongly resentful of the illegal migration of
                    Salvadorians into Western Honduras.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else that you would want to talk about in

                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>DEAL: One of the more amusing things I recalat least in retrospecconcerned
                    officer efficiency reports. You may remember that at that time you received two
                    efficiency reports, one you saw at post and another that was available for
                    viewing only in Washington. The latter was, for all practical purposes, the
                    “real report.” In any event, during an inspection of the Embassy, one of the
                    inspectors showed me excerpts of a reviewing statement made by DCM Wilkowski
                    regarding my wife Jill. Of course, in later years you were not permitted to say
                    anything about the actions or activities of other family members. In her report
                    Wilkowski said that my wife had the annoying habit of raising “substantive
                    issues”, e.g. Vietnam, with officers at cocktail parties, which was hardly
                    surprising for a Berkeley graduate. She thought Jill might be less intense “once
                    she had a few babies.” The inspector noted in his report that “Mr. Deal was
                    uncharacteristically negative” about the comments made by Wilkowski.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You wondered which officer she annoyed, maybe Jean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: I have no idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's kind of a strange comment, I would think
                        (even then).</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes, it was.</p>
                <p>This might be a good point to say a few words about our personal life in
                    Tegucigalpa. On arriving at post, we moved in for several weeks into the
                    incredibly seedy Hotel Savoy, an institution right out of a Graham Greene novel.
                    We then moved to a house in the city which was adequate, but virtually unlivable
                    because of the constant barking of dogs all night and the rather sickening
                    spectacle of army ants marching non-stop through our bathroom. Eventually, we
                    moved to a small house above Tegucigalpa, which was located in a coffee finca.
                    At an altitude of about 4,500 feet, it was comfortable year round.</p>
                <p>At the beginning of my tour, Jill taught English at the national university. A
                    violent student strike over the grading system brought that project to an end.
                    Jill, who was a qualified English teacher, then took a job with the American
                    High School.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>Our first son, Chris, was born in Tegucigalpa in 1967. There is a story
                    associated with his birth worth repeating. About one week before Jill entered
                    the Policlinica hospital to give birth to Chris, there was a bloody shootout in
                    a local bar between the head of the Departamento de Investigaci�n Nacional
                    (DIN), the local equivalent of the FBI, and a member of the Cuerpo Especial de
                    Seguridad (CES), the security police. The DIN head shot and killed the CES
                    agent, but was wounded by gunfire. The man from DIN was taken to the Policlinica
                    for treatment. While in the hospital, a group of CES agents broke into what they
                    believed was the DIN man's room and machine-gunned and stabbed the body to
                    death. With typical Honduran efficiency, they got the wrong man. They killed the
                    son of a military zone commander, who was in the hospital for a minor operation.
                    Of course, there was revenge on the CES team once they were caught. I don't know
                    exactly how or when that particular string of violence ended.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a memorable incident to say the least. Then after
                        Tegucigalpa, you went to Polish language training at the Foreign Service
                        Institute (FSI); that was a ten-month program. Did you have an onward
                        assignment already when you went into that program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: I had an assignment to the Embassy in Warsaw, but not to any particular
                    position. Most first or second-tour officers assigned to hard language training
                    generally expected to serve in the Consular Section (that was certainly my
                    expectation). But near the end of the language program, I was told that I would
                    be assigned as General Services Officer (GSO), the first language officer in
                    that position in the Embassy. I was very unhappy about that assignment. I did
                    not want to be the GSO, and that was one of several times in my career where I
                    thought maybe I should get out of this business. But I went ahead and took the
                    GSO course and went to Warsaw. It turned out to be a good experience and a good
                    choice, primarily because the people I worked with were talented and
                    capable.</p>
                <p>By the way, our trip to Warsaw was truly memorable. We were on one of the last
                    voyages of the SS United States. We sailed from New York for Bremerhaven,
                    Germany via Le Havre and Southampton. It was a five-day journey. Jill and I had
                    a great time. However, our son Chris, who was two, refused to eat. The waiters
                    tried to tempt him with all sorts of goodies but to no avail. (While in
                    Washington during language training he went through a period when he would eat
                    only Swanson chicken potpies).</p>
                <p>After arriving in Bremerhaven, we took the train to Munich where we picked up a
                    brand new BMW 1600 from the factory. We then drove to Warsaw via Vienna, Brno,
                    and Krakow. We passed through Czechoslovakia just one year after the Soviet
                    invasion. The country seemed incredibly grim and unfriendly. Crossing the
                    Czechoslovak border into Poland was a real relief. Incidentally, my son ended
                    his hunger strike over a wonderful Wiener Schnitzel in an outdoor caf� in
                    Salzburg.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You spent the first year as GSO and then you
                        switched?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: That's right. At the time, I did not know to which section I might rotate.
                    There were positions in the Political and Economic sections and at the Consulate
                    in Poznan. Everyone thought it made sense for me to take the slot in the
                    Economic Section. And that was ok with me; I was quite content with that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else you want to say about the Polish language
                        course or the GSO course, for that matter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Well, the GSO course was essential because, as it turned out, I did not
                    know anything about the administrative side of the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To step back for a minute, you had just finished your
                        first overseas tour in Tegucigalpa. Was it difficult to get this assignment?
                        You had mentioned before that you were looking for was an assignment to the
                        Communist bloc; did you just express your preference and it worked out or
                        was it more complex than that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: No, I merely requested Polish language training, knowing that meant an
                    assignment to Poland. Although some of my colleagues in Tegucigalpa thought I
                    was crazy for choosing Polish, arguing that I should stay in Latin America, I
                    really wanted to experience the Communist world. I don't recall it being
                    difficult to get into the language program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now when you took the language course, were you well
                        qualified in terms of the language to use in a job in Warsaw. I assume as
                        GSO you had to use Polish quite a bit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: I did. I graduated with a 3/3 in Polish at the end of the course. I
                    continued to take language lessons throughout my tour there and ended up with a
                    4/4 rating. Language training was one way of keeping up with developments in an
                    otherwise closed society.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>The GSO position was quite challenging. My predecessor had an American assistant,
                    but that position was abolished before my arrival, so I was really on my own. I
                    did have some very good Polish section chiefs, who were essential because you
                    really had to do make do with the resources on hand. For the most part, you
                    could not rely on outside contractors. Moreover, funds for upkeep were as usual
                    in short supply. The building programs and everything had to be managed with
                    staff on hand, using local currency and supplies whenever possible. We had
                    numerous residences to care for and not enough hard currency resources to keep
                    everybody happy. On top of that, the Ambassador, Walter Stoessel, a real prince,
                    had ambitious plans to make Warsaw into a first class post with good
                    recreational facilities for the staff. Among other things, that involved
                    building the first-ever paddle tennis court in Europe. (None of us had ever seen
                    a paddle tennis court before, and we had to build it to specifications brought
                    by the Ambassador).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Brought from Moscow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: No, this was before they built the court in Moscow. The game was something
                    that the Ambassador had seen or played in the United States. In retrospect, the
                    whole thing was quiet amusing, although I did not think so at the time. We hired
                    an outside contractor to do the job. This was one of the few times we used
                    somebody from the outside.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Polish contractor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes, a Polish contractor. Unfortunately, he broke his leg in the
                    construction process, and so the GSO staff had to take over the job and get it
                    finished. This was in the midst of one of the worst winters in Poland with
                    temperatures dipping down to twenty-below zero for days on end. Trying to finish
                    that job in those conditions was a real challenge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A paddle tennis court, as I understand, is essentially
                        outdoors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: It is a small-scale version of a tennis court. It has a high-tension fence
                    around it, and so the ball, which is hard rubber, can be played off the fence as
                    well as the wooden court itself. The Ambassador was right about the contribution
                    to staff morale because it was a game you could play throughout the winter day
                    or night. Eventually, everybody played, and there was an annual tournament.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I didn't realize that the beginning of this was in Warsaw,
                        but I know that (and it may have been Walter Stoessel who was directly
                        responsible) there was a rivalry or competition between the embassies in
                        Warsaw and Moscow.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>DEAL: You are right. Later on, the Embassy in Moscow built its own court, and
                    there were contests between the two embassies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought there was some Polish or Russian connection to
                        all this...interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: The connection was Walter Stoessel. We did a lot of other projects that
                    year including building a swimming pool at the residence and air-conditioning
                    the embassy. So there was always something going on; it was quite a job. I had
                    the fortune to work for Jim Leaken, one of the nicest people in the Foreign
                    Service. He was the Administrative Officer, a specialist, and a real pro. He
                    knew that I was unhappy about taking this job. So he went out of his way to make
                    sure that I had all the support I needed. He treated me exceptionally well and
                    contributed enormously to my promotion prospects along the way. We became good
                    friends and remained so throughout our Foreign Service careers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Stoessel was the Ambassador; who was the DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Walter Jenkins was the first year. I didn't have much contact with him,
                    particularly because the Ambassador took such a personal interest in the
                    construction projects. During my last two years, Gene Boster was DCM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, anything else about your year as GSO that you want to
                        mention?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Well, I could probably go on for hours about my experiences in that job,
                    but there are two vignettes worth repeating.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>As you may recall, the U.S. and China had periodically carried out negotiations
                    in Warsaw before the establishment of diplomatic relations. Late in 1969 or
                    early 1970, Ambassador Stoessel received instructions from Washington to take
                    the first available opportunity to make contact with the Chinese to let them
                    know the U.S. wanted to start the talks again. His opportunity came at a
                    Yugoslav fashion show at the Palace of Culture. The Chinese representative was
                    at the show, but got up early to leave. To the surprise of all of us there,
                    Ambassador Stoessel pursued the Chinese delegation out the room and eventually
                    to their car, which was out of our sight. The Ambassador passed on the message.
                    And very secretive talks commenced without the knowledge of most of us in the
                    Embassy. After one meeting at the Chinese Embassy, the Chinese came to the U.S.
                    Embassy on a very snowy Saturday morning. Their Red Flag car became bogged down
                    in the Embassy driveway and was visible to every passerby. We were in Helsinki
                    at the time visiting friends so I did not witness the incident personally. Jim
                    Leaken said that DCM Jenkins called him in a panic because of the Chinese car
                    being stuck in front of the Embassy. He wanted to know what was our snow removal
                    plan. Jim, not knowing what had transpired, told Jenkins that the plan was “the
                    same as last year.” Fortunately, the Chinese were able to move their car, but by
                    then everyone in Warsaw knew that the bilateral talks had started up again.</p>
                <p>Another story concerns the building of the swimming pool. Unlike the paddle
                    tennis court, we decided from the outset to build it ourselves. Pan Ryszard, our
                    maintenance chief, was in charge of construction. In the midst of the project,
                    Ryszard said he needed a huge amount of gravel, which for some unknown reason
                    was in short supply in Warsaw. I turned to my procurement chief, Pan Fred, who
                    believe it or not was a German U-boat commander in World War II who had married
                    a Pole, for help with the problem. With his usual efficiency, he said to leave
                    the matter to him. Days after, Polish Government trucks laden with gravel from
                    Silesia pulled into the Ambassador's residence and dumped their load. And the
                    building recommenced. This was one of many occasions in my time as GSO when you
                    knew better than to ask for details.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then in 1970 you moved into the economic section for
                        your last two years in Warsaw. What sort of work were you doing there, and
                        how big of a section was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: There were three officers in the section. Irving Schiffman was the chief of
                    the section. I was the most junior officer in the section, but I was the best
                    Polish language speaker. As a result, I did most of the economic reporting for
                    the section. That involved reading tedious economic and political journals and
                    listening to even more tedious speeches by Polish officials. The other two
                    officers in the section, especially in my last year there, tended to focus more
                    on trade promotion work because commercial opportunities began to open up as
                    relations improved.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To what extent as an economic reporting officer in this
                        period from 1970 to 1972 were you able to have Polish sources; did you go to
                        the Central Bank, the Ministry of Planning, and the Finance Ministry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: We had few Polish sources other than authorized contacts in the Ministry of
                    Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Trade. In addition, we had some
                    dealings with trading companies in connection with trade missions, catalog
                    shows, and the like. But most of the reporting was based on analysis of Party
                    journals and the press. Occasionally, the Ambassador or another senior Embassy
                    officer would pick up something that we could feed into our reporting. But that
                    was the exception rather than the rule. As I said earlier, by 1972 things began
                    to open up some. President Nixon stopped in Warsaw on his way back from Moscow,
                    the only high-level U.S. visitor during my tour in Poland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, toward the end of your stay there, were you involved
                        quite heavily in that visit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: I was in charge of the motor pool during that operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to the GSO office, eh?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: The embassy was fully mobilized for this visit. Fortunately, my role was
                    very minor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the first things I did in the Foreign Service in
                        1958 (maybe '59) was to be involved in, at least a little bit on the side,
                        some Polish aid talks, where we were already, at that time, thinking of
                        Poland as a little bit different and unique. Partly because of the
                        agricultural sector and perhaps for domestic and political reasons in the
                        United States, we were treating Poland different than other Warsaw Pact,
                        Eastern European countries. Did that continue in the period that you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>DEAL: The PL-480 commodity sales had ended by the time I arrived in Warsaw. They
                    probably ended about the time of the invasion of Czechoslovakia, if not before.
                    But the U.S. had sent a substantial amount of food aid to Poland, and Poland
                    paid for those shipments in zlotys (the local currency), on a schedule that
                    stretched out some thirty years. As a result of this payment schedule, the
                    Embassy was able to offer the staff a preferential exchange rate of 65 zlotys to
                    1 U.S. dollar, compared with the official exchange rate of 24 to 1 under which
                    our colleagues in the British Embassy, for example, had to operate. Whoever
                    devised this present value scheme did the U.S. a real service. The term of art
                    was “rear-end zloty”, which meant a payment due in, say, 1992. We drew down from
                    the end of the payment schedule to finance local currency outlays for Embassy
                    operations. When I was GSO, for example, we had very limited dollar funds for
                    furniture, appliances, etc. However, we were able to offer staff the opportunity
                    to look for things on the local market and use our staff to make drapes, lay
                    carpet, and buy paint. All that was important for morale.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You used local currency for such purposes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes. And by giving the staff an opportunity to window-shop on the local
                    market, they learned about the very limitations we faced. Still, with our
                    skilled Foreign Service Nationals in the GSO section to make drapes, upholster
                    furniture, etc., we were able to stretch our limited resources and make
                    everyone's life a little better. It was good use of the money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, anything else we should say about your assignment to
                        Warsaw?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>DEAL: Living in Poland at that time was a truly unique experience because you
                    could see first hand, perhaps better than in any other Eastern European country,
                    the inherent conflict between communism and nationalism. Communist ideology
                    never penetrated Polish political thinking in the same way it did elsewhere. The
                    Poles were not good Communists and, on a personal basis, were always friendly
                    towards Americans. So if you could speak the language and get beyond the
                    rhetoric, you found you had much in common with your average Polish citizen.
                    While contacts were limited, we did make some friends through my language
                    instructor. We knew that, theoretically at least, people we met had to report to
                    the authorities on their dealings with us. But we just figured we didn't have
                    anything to hide, so if they were comfortable with us, we were comfortable with
                    them. We met a number of non-official Poles without any apparent interference
                    from Polish intelligence. But you could never forget where you were. One unhappy
                    incident occurred during the visit of President Nixon's advance party. A
                    colleague, Vern Penner, who was one of three other officers who studied Polish
                    with me at the Foreign Service Institute and worked in the Political Section,
                    and I threw a joint farewell party for our contacts. We invited members of the
                    President's Advance Party to the event. We learned after the fact that our
                    friends, who had never been bothered by the UB, the Polish equivalent of the
                    KGB, were rounded up afterwards for questioning. Some, including my wife's piano
                    teacher, were warned not to have contacts with us in the future. It was a sad
                    footnote to an otherwise happy assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that happened partly because Penner was a
                        political officer and therefore attracted more attention from the
                        intelligence services, and perhaps the fact that it was a reception
                        involving the two of you...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: To be frank, Vern behaved a little furtively at times in much of his work,
                    and I think he probably aroused suspicions in intelligence circles. I am
                    convinced that the reason people were rounded up after the party had more to do
                    with Vern's work and behavior than mine. But that said, everybody who attended
                    the party suffered to some extent. My wife was especially upset at losing her
                    piano teacher because we raising our two kids and one of her only outlets was
                    music.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were your children in school yet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: My wife helped set up a nursery school there; she was co-chair of the
                    nursery school with one of her close friends from the British embassy. So my
                    oldest son, Chris, who was five by the time we left, went to the nursery school.
                    My youngest son, Bart, was born while we were in Warsaw.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was one other post under the consulate in Poland at
                        the time or two?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>DEAL: There was one, in Poznan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not yet in Krakow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: No, just Poznan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Poznan. And did they do any economic reporting or did you
                        visit there much? Did you travel around the country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Oh yes, we traveled quite extensively throughout the country, although
                    certain areas were closed to American diplomats. Those closures were strictly
                    reciprocal because we closed parts of the U.S. to Polish diplomats. I did travel
                    to one closed zone, Gdynia, shortly after the December 1970 riots on the Baltic
                    Coast to carry out a licensing check on some dual-use technology imported by
                    Poland. You could still see the wreckage from the disturbances in Gdansk, which
                    led to Gomulka's resignation as Party leader.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to see people involved with it at the time
                        or not so much... only the people you needed to see?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: No, I did not see anyone involved in those events. As I said earlier, it
                    was difficult to have contact with anyone except authorized journalists and
                    officials in the various ministries. I don't believe I ever met any Party
                    officials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The riots were in Warsaw too or only in Gdansk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: No, the riots occurred only on the coast, although all Poles were upset
                    about the major increase in food prices right before Christmas, which led to the
                    unrest. Those events had historic significance because protesters in the
                    shipyard eventually became the backbone of Solidarity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The economic issues were obviously in the forefront of
                        much of the period you were in the economic section; I assume the ambassador
                        was always looking for interpretation to help in understanding what was
                        happening.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes, he saw very clearly the connection between what was happening in the
                    economy and its impact on political developments.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To what extent were you interested or coordinated with
                        other Eastern European embassies at that time? Berlin, for example?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: We read what other Embassies reported and could see, even from our limited
                    perspective, that conditions in Poland were better than in the rest of the
                    neighborhood. We went on a Department-sponsored trip to the Soviet Union in
                    1972, and the comparison between the two countries was mind-boggling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left in 1972, would you say that you had any kind
                        of inkling of what was likely to happen in Poland not too many years
                        hence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: I certainly wouldn't have forecast what happened in the '80s. But I think
                    we all recognized that an important precedent had been established, namely, that
                    popular uprisings could precipitate political change in the Communist world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What role, if any, did academics or intellectuals play in
                        these events?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Well, there was a small dissident movement that led to a crackdown in 1968
                    before we arrived in Poland. Perhaps we can pick that up later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, why don't you continue on that thought?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: There was always a certain amount of resentment among Poles about the fact
                    that the Polish Communist leadership essentially came from people who sat out
                    the war in Russia and moved into Poland with the Red Army in contrast to those
                    who fought in the resistance at home, had links to the exile government in
                    London, or somehow cooperated with the Allies. You don't need much to spark
                    anti-Semitic feelings in Poland. And the belief that many postwar Polish
                    Communist leaders were Jewish kept that sentiment alive even though the actual
                    number of Jews living in Poland was miniscule. In 1968, all this came to a head
                    when nationalists associated with Home Army General Moczar launched an
                    anti-Jewish campaign whose real target was the Communist Party leadership. The
                    campaign had little effect on the Communists, but did lead to the departure of
                    many of the few remaining Jews. I don't believe that the academic community and
                    intellectuals had much influence on developments in Poland, at least during my
                    time there. Their influence increased markedly in the 1980's when they joined
                    forces with Solidarity.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time you were there, Poland was largely
                        agricultural and the farmers have always played a significant economic, but
                        also a political role; was there an agricultural attach�? Did you spend lot
                        of time thinking about the role of the agricultural sector in the overall
                        economy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes, we had a very active Agricultural Attach�, who did a lot of internal
                    reporting. At the time, Polish agriculture was about 85 percent private and only
                    15 percent collective. The agricultural sector was not particularly efficient,
                    but because it was in private hands, it had important political
                    significance.</p>

                <p>DEAL: Right. We had very close working relations with all sections of the Embassy
                    including the USDA representatives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, anything else about your assignment from '69 to '72 in
                        Warsaw?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Just a few personal notes again. Despite the occasionally grim political
                    atmosphere and the harsh winters, Warsaw was one of our best overseas
                    experiences. The Embassy, led by Ambassador Stoessel, was a top-notch operation,
                    and many of the officers assigned there during this period eventually rose to
                    the highest ranks in the Department. Living conditions were difficult, but I
                    certainly preferred Warsaw to Tegucigalpa. Even the intelligence presence
                    occasionally had its lighter side. For example, during the visit of the Apollo
                    15 astronaut team in January 1972, a planned trip to Krakow had to be cancelled
                    because of a snowstorm. I was one of the Control Officers for the visit. The
                    astronauts had extra time on their hands, so Ambassador and Mrs. Stoessel took
                    them to a nightclub in Warsaw to see the local sights. Jill and I accompanied
                    them. Naturally, UB operatives trailed after the party, but they were very
                    obvious. Jill bet the Ambassador a bottle of wine that she could get the head of
                    the UB team to dance with her. The Ambassador took the bet, and Jill promptly
                    walked over to the UB team. She somehow persuaded the UB chief to dance with
                    her, and the next day the Ambassador's chauffeur brought us a very expensive
                    bottle of French wine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, and where did you go when you left there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Well, I wanted academic training in economics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Having served twice as an economic officer...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>DEAL: Yes, and the Economic-Commercial Officer's course was my goal. Ambassador
                    Stoessel wrote a good recommendation for me to the Assistant Secretary for
                    Economic and Business Affairs that not only helped me get into the course, but
                    also resulted in an onward assignment to that Bureau even before the course
                    began.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The economic course, at the time you took it, was 22 weeks
                        in length? 26 weeks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: 26 weeks, right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it was reported to be the equivalent of an
                        undergraduate major in economics in six months?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes, and I believe it lived up to expectations. At the conclusion of the
                    course, we took the Graduate Records Exam in Economics, and I scored in the
                    eighty-fifth percentile. That was about par for the course and a good reflection
                    of the quality of the teaching. It was superb, well organized course with
                    exceptional instructors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that was certainly my experience; I took the course
                        a few years before you did but I certainly thought it was a very well
                        organized, comprehensive, professional program. So, where did you go from
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: As I said, I had an assignment to the Bureau of Economics and Business
                    Affairs (EB), to the Special Trade Activity Division of the Office of Trade.
                    Despite my good experience in the Economics course, this turned out to be one of
                    my toughest assignments in the Service. It was my first exposure to work in
                    Washington, and it was deadening. We dealt primarily with antidumping and
                    countervailing duty cases, in which the Treasury, at that time, had the full
                    authority. Our job was to inform overseas posts about these investigations and
                    on occasion make a political argument for deferring action, e.g. the Foreign
                    Minister of the country concerned was coming to Washington, etc. We rarely
                    prevailed. My experience was made even more negative because the section chief,
                    a really good guy by the name of Ed Kempe, was pulled away on a temporary
                    assignment to be an aide to the Under Secretary of Economic Affairs. That left
                    the Foreign Service Officers in the section at the mercy of a civil servant who
                    was bureaucratic, dull, and an exceptionally poor manager. This was one of the
                    few times in the Foreign Service when I really dreaded going to the office on
                    Mondays.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ed Kempe replaced me in 1975 in Bern, Switzerland as
                        Economic Counselor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Is that right?</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So he probably didn't come back to Special Trade
                        Activities, or did he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Well, he returned for a while and then another officer replaced him. The
                    first six months on the job were really hard, but the following 12 months were
                    better primarily because I was able to work on other issues, not just
                    antidumping and countervailing duty cases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Special Trade Activities may have been worse than
                        some other parts of the Economic Bureau, but I think for a new officer,
                        almost anywhere in that bureau in that time period, would have found it
                        difficult because, not having served in Washington previously, you were at a
                        disadvantage in dealing with agencies that had people well-entrenched with
                        strong policy points-of-view. I worked in the Bureau, not in that office,
                        but somewhere nearby in the '60s and I remember the first six months were
                        pretty hard, as well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes, I think that's true because in interagency deliberations the
                    Department's economic expertise didn't appear to count for much. The
                    Department's voice mattered most when you could point to the possible political
                    impact of some action on relations with a particular country or region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it was also an area where the impact you had depended
                        a lot on people up the line and whether they were prepared to be supportive
                        or take an interest in a particular issue or problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a Foreign Service officer in Special Trade
                        Activities, probably after you had left, named Brad Bishop. Was he there
                        with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: No, but he was in my A-100 class. He was very interesting and seemed more
                    mature than most of us. I didn't know much about his background, but he always
                    struck me as being a potential high-flyer. So, what happened later came as a
                    great surprise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He would have been a little bit older than you. He
                        graduated in 1954 from high school in South Pasadena, San Marino. He
                        happened to be in the same high school class as my wife.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Oh really?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, I never met him but well, we'll leave it at that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: His wife was very attractive and intelligent too, which made the tragedy
                    even greater.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She went to the same high school, I believe, but was not
                        in the same class. Maybe for the record we should say that in 1975 or 1976,
                        there was a murder that I don't think has ever been solved, but Bishop's
                        wife, children, and his mother were all murdered in their home in
                        Bethesda.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: That's right, and he disappeared.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he disappeared and was never found.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, anything else about your, was it two years that you
                        were in Special Trade Activities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: It turned out to be 18 months because I was given the opportunity to move
                    to the Office of Eastern European Affairs in the European Bureau. Nick Andrews,
                    who was Chief of the Political Section during my first two years in Warsaw,
                    asked me if I would be interested in one of the two economic jobs in his
                    office.I said yes and they were able to break my assignment in EB. At the last
                    minute, because of other personnel changes in the office, Nick asked me to take
                    over as Desk Officer for Czechoslovakia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that was in 1974?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: In 1974, right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And anything special about that period? It was not too
                        long after'68, in terms of relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>DEAL: U.S.-Czechoslovak relations were difficult at the time, but when I joined
                    the office the U.S. had just negotiated a claims settlement with the
                    Czechoslovakia, which should have paved the way for a better relationship.
                    However, at the same time, Congress was debating the Trade Act of 1974, which
                    was to become the basic trade negotiating authority for the Tokyo Round. Senate
                    Finance Committee Chairman Russell Long introduced an amendment to the
                    legislation, which required that any claims settlement with Czechoslovakia
                    should be at 100 cents on the dollar, not the 25-30 cents settlements negotiated
                    with other countries. Furthermore, Czechoslovakia had to repay the claims in
                    gold held by the Tripartite Gold Commission after World War II. So, whatever
                    hopes there might have been for a better relationship were dashed in my first
                    few months on the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there was no claims agreement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Not at that time. A settlement would not come until years later. I did go
                    to Prague in the fall of 1974 and met with the Czechoslovak authorities to
                    discuss the legislation. I was relatively optimistic that the amendment would
                    not pass, but, of course, I was wrong. The bilateral relationship went back into
                    the freezer, and I turned to the care and feeding of Embassy Prague. Still, in
                    looking back, I considered it a good experience since it was my first exposure
                    to political work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador to Czechoslovakia at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Bud Scherer, but he was seldom in Prague. He was in charge of the CSCE
                    negotiations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose you also spent a lot of time working with the
                        Czechoslovak Embassy in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes, we had regular dealings with Embassy officials. I attended their
                    social events regularly, and we had a civil relationship despite the problems
                    between the two countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were restrictions on air travel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes, and there were other problems as well. I had a minor part in an FBI
                    sting operation to arrest a Czechoslovak Embassy Officer accused of spying. The
                    bureau caught him red-handed, and he was expelled from the country. Of course,
                    that didn't help the bilateral relationship much either.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there retaliation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Undoubtedly, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, anything else involved that you want to mention in
                        connection with that year as Czechoslovak desk officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: I think that's about it. After one year on the job, Nick Andrews asked me
                    to take over the Polish desk in 1975.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was still Office Director?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: He was; the deputy was Carol Brown. They liked what I had done as
                    Czechoslovak desk officer and asked me to take over the larger responsibilities
                    of the Polish desk. We had a much active policy toward Poland at that time
                    following a marked improvement in bilateral relations dating back to the Nixon
                    visit in 1972. The portfolio also included liaison work with the Board for
                    International Broadcasting, Radio Free Europe, and Radio Liberty. In that
                    capacity, I worked directly with Jack Armitage, the Deputy Assistant Secretary
                    who supervised the Offices of Soviet and Eastern European Affairs. Relations
                    with the two Radios could be sensitive since they were engaged in reporting on
                    internal developments in those countries that was often critical of the
                    regimes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, the Radios were located in Munich. With whom did you
                        deal in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: The Board for International Broadcasting provided oversight for the Radios,
                    and I dealt regularly with their Washington representatives. I did visit Munich
                    and met with chiefs of the various language services.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When issues came up, they didn't necessarily involve only
                        the Polish Service, correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: That is correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it just happened that the Polish desk officer...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>DEAL: I don't know how the liaison responsibilities with the Radios came to be
                    tied to the Polish desk, but my predecessors had that role and so I followed in
                    their footsteps. I would guess that I spent probably 30 percent of my time on
                    issues relating to the Radios. Doing this work involved other offices and
                    agencies because of the need to address such issues as the lease of transmitters
                    for the Radios in Spain and Portugal. There was also strong White House interest
                    in these matters.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you were the senior desk officer for Poland; did you
                        supervise somebody else or were you pretty much by yourself on the
                        desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Pretty much by myself. Again, there was an economic officer that covered
                    three countries, Poland, being the most important of the three.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But he would report to the deputy director of the
                        office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Well, we worked together but yes, essentially, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much of your time and energy was devoted to the
                        contacts with the Polish-American community, or Members of Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Some. As was the case with the Czechoslovak desk, I met regularly with
                    members of the �migr� community. We had good relations with the Polish-American
                    Congress. I went to Chicago and met their officers. Relations with Czechoslovak
                    �migr� community were more strained because of their hard line stance, while we
                    were trying to keep relations on an even keeor from deteriorating further.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Polish-American �migr�s interested in an even
                        more improved relationship or were they generally supportive and comfortable
                        with where we were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: While views were not unanimous, they generally supported good relations
                    between the U.S. and Poland. Many Polish-Americans eventually returned to Poland
                    for their retirement years there, so there was a wholly different attitude on
                    the part of the Polish as distinct from Czechoslovak �migr� communities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As desk officer for Poland, how about the Catholic Church;
                        was that something, either in terms of the Vatican or otherwise...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>DEAL: Well, I didn't have anything specific to do with the Catholic Church. Of
                    course, the Church played an important role in Polish life. And regime-Church
                    relations were closely monitored in Washington and Warsaw, but, again, I had no
                    special responsibility for that issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You helped the Embassy in Warsaw and worked with the
                        Polish Embassy in Washington. Anything else about being on the desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: An active desk in the Department can be very demanding and frustrating at
                    times. For example, my closest contact in the Polish Embassy was the Political
                    Counselor, Kaz Duchowski.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the Polish Embassy in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes. He was a charming diplomat with whom I kept in touch through the
                    1980's. What used to drive me crazy about that job was that the phone never
                    stopped ringing. There was always something happening. Some of the most
                    troublesome incidents involved Polish sailors jumping ship in U.S. ports and
                    then asking to stay in the U.S. One day Kaz Duchowski called about the latest
                    sailor incident, and I answered “Hello” in a very annoyed voice. Kaz said, “Tim,
                    slow down. You've got the worst telephone manners of anybody I've ever worked
                    with; you've got to get over this stuff”. It was a poignant reminder of the need
                    for diplomatic niceties from a good friend and contact. We had to work with the
                    Polish Embassy on a lot of these messy cases, and I had to learn to keep my
                    cool.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. The ambassador in Poland was no longer Stoessel I'm
                        sure, at that time. He was in either Moscow or maybe Bonn, perhaps. John
                        Davis was DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes, and Dick Davies was Ambassador.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DEAL: It was just called Eastern European affairs (EE).</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see that you left the Polish desk job after only nine

                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>DEAL: I went to the National Security Council (NSC) in the White House, in what
                    became the first of three tours there. The opportunity came up out of the blue.
                    Tony Albrecht, who was head of Regional Economic and Political Affairs (EUR/RPE)
                    in the European Bureau and a car pool mate of Ed Kempe from EB/STA, said that
                    Bob Hormats, who was head of the International Economic Section of the NSC, was
                    looking for someone with trade and Eastern European experience. Albrecht asked
                    me if I was interested in being interviewed for the position. I said
                    “Certainly!” So I went over to the Old Executive Office Building and interviewed
                    with Bob Hormats. The interview went well and within a couple of weeks he
                    offered me the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was in 1976?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was the end of the Ford administration, before the
                        election?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Right. Of course, we did not know then that President Ford would be on his
                    way out in November. In any event, I did focus on trade and East-West economic
                    issues. One of my first assignments was to write a speech for the President on
                    trade policy. I also initiated a study on east-west economic relations that
                    started in the fall of 1976. But with an election looming, much of the work we
                    did was ad hoc in nature involving briefing materials or talking points for the
                    President or his National Security Advisor, General Scowcroft. As a result, I
                    can't point to many specific accomplishments during that period.</p>
                <p>In early November, I began to experience the classic symptoms of angina. It
                    turned out that I had badly blocked arteries. Tests just before Christmas
                    confirmed that I needed an operation. Within weeks, I was up at the NYU Medical
                    Center for my first bypass operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably before they were doing a lot of those.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: There weren't too many places, no, and my doctor, Michael Halberstam, who
                    was later murdered...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Brother of David...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes, David Halberstam of “Best and the Brightest” fame. Well, Michael
                    Halberstam was a talented, capable doctor with impeccable connections, and he
                    basically said I had a choice of about five centers. We just picked the one that
                    was closest to us in New York City.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes. When I first described my symptoms to my wife, she said “you had
                    better get somebody good”. One of her colleagues at the Federal Trade
                    Commission, where she was working, recommended Dr. Halberstam, and he took me
                    on. That was good because he had the connections to get me in with a really good
                    surgeon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In New York?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: In New York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back, if we could, just a little bit to this
                        first year in '76; still the Ford administration. You were working for Bob
                        Hormats, what was his position in the NSC hierarchy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: He was, in effect, the Senior Director for International Economic Affairs,
                    although he did not have that exact title. He had come to work at the NSC staff
                    during the Nixon period and stayed on under Ford. By the time I arrived on the
                    scene, Bob was highly regarded within the Administration and well respected as
                    the guru on international economic issues with political implications. So he had
                    a very senior position within the administration. There was one other person
                    working with me, Malcolm Butler, who ultimately went on to become a ranking
                    official in AID. Oddly enough, Malcolm and I were in the same A-100 course, but
                    we had never worked together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the National Security Advisor was General Scowcroft.
                        Did he show much interest in international economic issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Certainly not as much as he did in Bush Administration. In the Nixon
                    administration the Council for International Economic Policy was responsible for
                    managing international economic policy issues. While that unit did not continue
                    in Ford Administration, there was an international economic policy person in the
                    White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Separate from the NSC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes. So international economic issues, especially those with domestic
                    implications such as trade, were handled through that office. As a result,
                    General Scowcroft did not devote as much time to economic matters as he did when
                    we worked together from 1989 to 1992.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Perhaps the Office of the Special Trade Representative
                        wasn't as strong as it later became?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: It played a major role even then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it was involved in Eastern Europe issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: No, not really. Because East-West economic relations were so political in
                    nature and because the volume of trade was relatively small, such matters were
                    not high on the policy agenda at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had your surgery at the end of '76, just shortly
                        after the election. Did that keep you out of operation for a while?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: I was out about a month; of course, it was after the election and there
                    wasn't much going on then. I had my operation in the middle of December and I
                    was back in the office in early January for the last days of the Ford
                    administration and then the transition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you stayed around for a while in the Carter
                        administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes, one the key things that Bob Hormats had done in the Ford
                    administration was to serve as point person (eventually called the Sherpa) for
                    economic summits. He had helped organize the first two economic summits in 1975
                    and 1976. So when the White House changed hands, Bob was asked to accompany Vice
                    President Mondale on a trip to G7 countries to talk about mutual economic
                    problems and economic coordination. We sometimes forget how bad things were
                    economically during those years. The Carter administration wanted to take the
                    temperature among the G7 countries and see what could be done to improve
                    coordination of macroeconomic policy, trade policy, and energy security.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go on that trip?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: No, but because of Bob's role on the G-7 trip, he was in a very solid
                    position in the new administration and he asked me to stay on with Brzezinski's
                    approval.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You hadn't dealt with Brzezinski when you were on the
                        Polish desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>DEAL: No, not at all. I was quiet fortunate to stay on because Brzezinski decided
                    to reduce the size of the NSC staff markedly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then Hormats moved to the State Department before too
                        long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes, in the summer of 1977, he moved over to State to become a Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary in the EB Bureau. For a period of a few months, I was on my
                    own on the NSC staff, and then Henry Owen, who had been a foreign policy advisor
                    to President Carter in the campaign and who had a role in preparing for a NATO
                    summit that year, was asked by Brzezinski to run the economic operation in the
                    White House. So I then worked for Owen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he later organized the G7 or...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes, that became his major role. He had a position that was supposedly
                    equal to Brzezinski's. In fact, anything he wrote to the President had to pass
                    through Brzezinski. Nonetheless, his supposedly separate reporting channel
                    caused problems for me. I essentially worked for two people because certain
                    issues such as East-West economic relations, which were of burning interest to
                    Brzezinski, didn't interest Henry Owen at all. He was much more interested in
                    economic summitry, policy coordination, food aid, and energy policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Policy coordination?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: He was involved in the coordination of international economic policy issues
                    across-the-board including trade, aid, and energy. On matters relating to
                    Eastern Europe or the Soviet Union, I dealt directly with the European
                    Directorate of the NSC, headed by Reggie Bartholomew. Thus. I had my own
                    separate reporting requirements and coordination responsibilities. Much of this
                    work involved strategic trade, and Brzezinski had a whole coterie of advisors on
                    those issues, including the Military Aide, Bill Odom, and Sam Huntington, who
                    was a special advisor. The big issue at the time was Soviet oil. A CIA analysis
                    suggested that Soviet oil production had peaked and would fall rapidly, giving
                    the Soviets an incentive to increase their influence in the Middle East. The
                    Carter White House had the idea that the U.S. could somehow gain leverage over
                    the Soviets by making it difficult for them to obtain needed technology, such as
                    submersible drill pumps. Personally, I thought there was some disconnect here
                    because if Soviet oil stocks were dropping, it would have made sense to help the
                    Soviets with technology to keep them out of the Middle East. I don't believe
                    these two policy strands ever really came together.</p>

                <p>In any event, I spent a lot of time on those issues, as well as the vexing
                    Jackson-Vanik question, which concerned Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union.
                    There were running battles between the NSC and other agencies such as State and
                    Treasury. The Treasury, particularly, Secretary Blumenthal, wanted to eliminate
                    the Jackson-Vanik provision from the Trade Act, which he thought made relations
                    with the Soviet Union more complex and difficult than necessary. However, this
                    was one of those occasions where the White House had the upper hand and a person
                    like Brzezinski prepared to wield that power. So personal views aside, I had
                    primary drafting responsibilities for Memoranda from Brzezinski to the President
                    that essentially said, “Ignore the views of Secretary Vance and Secretary
                    Blumenthal and Keep Existing Policy in place.” It was a sobering experience for
                    a mid-grade FSO.</p>

                        like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: No. This was really a case pitting Congress and Jewish interest groups,
                    with support from the White House, against the foreign policy establishment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To what extent did you have any interaction with President

                </p>
                <p>DEAL: I had no direct contact with President Ford. In the case of President
                    Carter, my one face-to-face contact with him came during discussions with the
                    British over renewal of the Bermuda II Agreement, covering aviation relations
                    between the U.S. and UK. I was the note taker in Carter's office during a
                    telephone conversation with the British Prime Minister. Incidentally, Bermuda II
                    was a real step backwards in terms of aviation liberalization. This restrictive
                    agreement, which to this day limits American and British carriers' access to
                    each other's market, was in complete contrast to open sky agreements we
                    concluded with other countries beginning in the late 1970s.</p>

                        last time when we finished about your assignment to the National Security
                        Council staff during the Carter administration from '76 to'79. You worked
                        for Brzezinski, and I think we had talked some last time about some of the
                        things you did in that job, but I don't know if there's anything more you
                        want to add about your assignment there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: No. In April 1979, I concluded what was to be the first of three tours in
                    the White House. I returned to State in May to become George Vest's special
                    assistant.</p>

                        the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: That's correct. This was supposed to be a one-year assignment. Basically, I
                    wanted to see how other offices in the Bureau operated and become more familiar
                    with NATO and Political-Military affairs. And this position gave me that
                    opportunity. George Vest was a wonderful man to work for, a real gentleman. He
                    also relied heavily on his line officers. So the job of Special Assistant
                    provided few opportunities for independent work. The main tasks were to manage
                    the paper flow and ensure that the Executive Secretariat on the Seventh Floor
                    was satisfied with Bureau products, be they action memos, briefing papers, or
                    items for inclusion in daily summary for the President. So it was a
                    paper-pushing job, but I was working for one of the all-time pros in the Foreign
                    Service.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DEAL: That was really about it, I can't say much more about the position except I
                    that enjoyed working for George Vest and continued to have good contacts with
                    him throughout the remainder of my Foreign Service career.</p>

                        I worked for George Vest twice, once when he was the Assistant Secretary and
                        later when he was Director General. I agree that he was a wonderful person
                        and one for whom I have enormous respect.</hi>

                <p>DEAL: Toward the end of 1979, Henry Owen called me and said that the member of
                    his staff that dealt with trade issues was leaving, and he asked if I would
                    consider returning to the NSC staff. I accepted his offer, and the Department
                    approved the move. Theoretically, I was going back to fill the role I had
                    before, but, in the interim, the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. Rather than trade
                    policy, I became totally -involved with U.S.-Soviet relations, including the
                    grain embargo, economic sanctions, and the Olympic boycott, as well as economic
                    relations with Iran in the face of the Embassy hostage crisis. Early in 1980,
                    Brzezinski asked Henry Owen to set up a special group to coordinate all economic
                    matters relating to the Soviet Union and Iran. There were numerous, complicated
                    financial and licensing questions, which required decisions at home and
                    coordination with our allies. In the early months of 1980, that group met at the
                    Assistant Secretary level virtually every day. Henry Owen would chair the
                    meeting; I would coordinate the preparations for it and take notes. I would draw
                    up a summary of conclusions immediately after the meeting and then turn them
                    over to Gary Sick, who was the NSC staff member in charge of Iran, since most of
                    action items concerned Iran rather than the Soviet Union. He would incorporate
                    our group's findings and recommendations into a daily memorandum for the
                    President. The President would respond over night, and we had our marching
                    orders for the next day.</p>
                <p>These issues consumed all my time for the remainder of 1980, and I continued to
                    work on them even after the election. I worked under David Aaron, the Deputy
                    National Security Advisor, on a list of possible NATO sanctions, the so-called
                    “Gray List,” that were to go into effect immediately in the event of a Soviet
                    invasion of Poland, which seemed likely at that time, according to intelligence
                    sources. I drafted a set of instructions to agencies regarding the sanctions
                    that Aaron signed on January 19, 1981, one day before the end of the Carter
                    Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any sense looking back of why the Soviets
                        decided not to intervene in Poland at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: I think it was probably a combination of factors: (a) Afghanistan was
                    proving more difficult to govern than the Soviets had expected; (b) the allied
                    response to the invasion was fairly strong even with divisions in the allied
                    ranks; (c) Poland would likely be an even tougher nut to crack; and (d) the
                    Soviets might have expected an even more vigorous response from the incoming
                    Reagan Administration than the outgoing Carter Administration. But all of this
                    is really speculation on my part.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How effective were the sanctions against the USSR?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>DEAL: I don't think they were terribly effective. We tried without success to
                    encourage our allies to adopt similar policies. They were strong on the
                    rhetoric, but failed to deliver in practice. The grain embargo was almost
                    impossible to enforce because of sales from Argentina and elsewhere. On the
                    industrial side, French and German firms moved in after U.S. firms were forced
                    to pull out of major industrial projects in the Soviet Union. EB Assistant
                    Secretary Hinton came up with some imaginative ways to penalize the French and
                    Germans, but nothing much happened because of the election and the new threat of
                    an invasion of Poland.Economic sanctions are popular among policymakers as
                    clearly preferable to military action. Unfortunately, such sanctions seldom
                    prove decisive in large part because of the difficulty of organizing a truly
                    coordinated multilateral response.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that your feeling with regard to the measures against
                        Iran, as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: The freezing of Iranian assets clearly had a major impact and did give us
                    some leverage over the Iranian regime. One could argue, of course, that the
                    seizure of those assets prolonged the hostage crisis. In the end, I believe it
                    was the right thing to do even though these problems have not been fully sorted
                    out some 25 years after the events.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The assets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: I believe some of those assets are still frozen, and there may still be
                    problems with military equipment paid for but not delivered, among other things.
                    I haven't followed these matters closely since then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the campaign, the election period? Of course,
                        you had a case where an incumbent President was running for re-election. To
                        what extent, were you, as a member of the NSC staff, wrapped up into
                        campaign or political matters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Very little. The NSC staff really played no political role other than
                    preparing Q's and A's on issues likely to arise in the campaign.</p>
                <p>

                        and then I guess I'd like to next ask, how long did you stay through the
                        transition and into the new administration of President Reagan?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>DEAL: As I said, the final action in the Carter administration with which I was
                    involved was the drafting of the Soviet sanctions memo in the event of an
                    invasion of Poland. That, in effect, became my starting point with the new
                    Administration. NSC staff from the Carter White House met with the incoming
                    National Security Advisor, Richard Allen, on January 19, 1980. Allen informed
                    the staff that there would be major personnel changes and that agency detailees
                    should plan on returning to their home office and others should seek new
                    employment. After the meeting, I mentioned to Allen that I had been working on
                    the sanctions project and asked him whether he wanted my help while they
                    assembled their team. I noted that I already had an ongoing assignment in the
                    Foreign Service for the coming summer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the following summer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes. Allen said, “Come back on the 21st and continue to manage that
                    portfolio for us”. Well, lo and behold, after having dismissed most of the
                    staff, it turned out there were only two of us, Jim Rentschler and I, who had
                    the necessary security clearances. As a result, over the next week or so, Jim
                    and I divided the “world.”</p>
                <p>I was involved in issues for which I had had no responsibility before including
                    Soviet political affairs and Central and South America. I organized the first
                    two cabinet-level meetings of the NSC in the new Administration, taking the
                    notes and ensuring necessary follow-up actions. The main issues on the agenda
                    then were the Soviet threat to invade Poland, Polish debt, and Central America,
                    the latter due to campaign commitments to do something about curbing the alleged
                    arms flow from Cuba via Nicaragua to El Salvador. It was rather odd to be
                    involved in these matters in a new Administration, attending Cabinet-level
                    meetings, taking the notes, and seeing President Reagan in operation, such a
                    different person than...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Than President Carter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Than President Carter, yes, absolutely. In the first meeting, he made it
                    abundantly clear that, if necessary, he was going to take out any aircraft
                    coming out of Cuba, carrying arms into Nicaragua. I recall taking the notes and
                    then consulting Richard Allen afterwards about whether he wanted those comments
                    in the official record, which I thought would not necessarily be wise. He agreed
                    and said, “Don't put that in the record then.”</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>I was involved in another matter involving Central America as well. My wife, who
                    had joined the Arnold &amp; Porter law firm in 1979, worked closely with Paul
                    Reichler, an attorney who, among other things, represented the Sandanistas in
                    Washington. About 10 days into the Administration, just by chance, Paul and his
                    wife invited Jill and me to dinner at his house. Since I knew of his role
                    regarding Nicaragua and that he was on his way to Managua to meet with Daniel
                    Ortega, I called the State Department and spoke with Deputy Assistant Secretary
                    Jim Cheek in the Latin American bureau. I told him I was having dinner with
                    Reichler and asked if there were any kind of message I should pass on to him in
                    light of his forthcoming trip to Managua. He said yes and gave me some talking
                    points, the gist of which was that Reichler should tell Ortega, “These guys are
                    serious about stopping the gun-running into El Salvador.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These guys, meaning the new U.S. administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Right. And the Nicaraguans had better take these warnings seriously or it
                    was “going to come down on their heads.” I dutifully passed this message on to
                    Reichler. Within days, a searing NODIS message came in from our ambassador in
                    Managua saying, “It's only two weeks into this administration and already there
                    is a separate line of communication that's been established with the
                    Sandanistas. Who's doing this and why?” When Richard Allen saw the message he
                    called me over to the White House and asked, “How in the hell did this happen
                    and what was your role in it?” I explained to him what had happened, that I had
                    operated on the basis of talking points supplied by State, which had thought it
                    a good idea to pass on a tough message to the Sandanistas. Well, Jim Cheek took
                    it upon himself to square matters with our Ambassador in Managua, assuring him
                    there was no any separate line of communication. At about the same time, the
                    Nicaraguan ambassador in Washington called me and asked for a meeting. I said,
                    “No.” I just wanted to get out of this mess.After a few weeks, the matter was
                    cleared up. But I had a post mortem with Allen who wanted to know how I become
                    acquainted with Reichler in the first place. I said, “My wife works with him at
                    a law firm here in Washington.” He said, “Which law firm?” I said, “Arnold and
                    Porter”. He said, “That's a pinko law firm!” That was the day I figured it was
                    about time to move on.</p>

                        happened, is not that unusual: a Washington lawyer representing a foreign
                        government or any foreign party is going to try and find out what is coming
                        up, what the situation is, to advise his clients and that's essentially what
                        he did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes, he certainly did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You took a little initiative maybe more than Allen might
                        have wished or expected, but not an unusual one.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>DEAL: I didn't think so. I was impressed by how forceful the new people in the
                    Administration were about the situation in Central America and thought people on
                    the ground should know that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was certainly a big issue; I remember I was in
                        Washington at the time in those early months of the Reagan administration.
                        How quickly did the NSC staff get clearances to take up their jobs? You said
                        there were just you and Jim Rentschler to start with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: People were in place, particularly in the key areas such as Soviet affairs,
                    within a few weeks. Even then, some of the new staff did not have the clearances
                    yet, so Jim Rentschler and I continued to do the organizational work for
                    meetings. Certainly by the middle of March or so, I found myself underemployed.
                    In April, I concluded my second tour at the NSC and began preparing for my
                    oncoming assignment to London.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a transition team at the NSC, as there was at
                        the State Department before January 20th?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes there was. I didn't have much to do with them at the time. Henry Nau,
                    who eventually became head of the economic directorate of the NSC, was there in
                    a transition capacity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some of the transition people at the State Department, I'm
                        thinking of one and I can't quite remember his name, I think went to the NSC
                        when the new administration came in. He was a Soviet expert, very hard-line;
                        who am I thinking of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Richard Pipes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's whom I was thinking of. He was on the transition
                        team at State.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Again, I really didn't have much to do with him other than turn over to him
                    the work on Soviet sanctions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, anything else about your 2nd time at the NSC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: No, I think that's about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And where did you go after that in the spring or summer of
                        '81?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: By that time we had been in Washington nine years. My wife had gone to work
                    for AARP in about 1973 and, after a year, moved to the Federal Trade Commission.
                    While at the FTC, she started law school at nights. From the FTC, she went into
                    private practice with Arnold and Porter. So we were both exhausted from
                    Washington and wanted to do something different. While at various times during
                    those years I had toyed with the notion of leaving the Foreign Service and doing
                    something else in Washington, Jill and I ultimately decided an overseas
                    assignment might be the best course. We thought our two boys, Chris and Bart,
                    would benefit from such a change. So while the Carter Administration was coming
                    to a close, I began to look at overseas options where Jill could put her legal
                    skills to use and I could do something reasonably interesting. There weren't a
                    lot of good choices at the FSO-3 level. The job as Energy Attach� in Embassy
                    London looked the most promising so I applied for it and was selected. We left
                    for London in the summer of 1981.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, why don't we talk about that job just for a minute?
                        That's mainly working with the oil companies in London?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes, in the 1970's the UK became a major oil producer. The British were not
                    members of OPEC and were, therefore, considered reliable suppliers. With high
                    oil prices, there was a lot of interest in energy issues generally and the UK in
                    particular. I did not have any special expertise or background in energy issues,
                    but I learned quickly and ended up enjoying that position.</p>
                <p>In 1981, the Department introduced a new personnel system, establishing the
                    Senior Foreign Service. I took the first opportunity to compete for the Senior
                    Foreign Service and I was promoted to the new rank of Counselor that year. As a
                    result, I was really too high a grade for the Energy Attach� position. DCM Ed
                    Streator, Economic Minister Bob Morris, and Economic Counselor Mike Boerner
                    thought I would be a good candidate to replace Boerner when he took over for
                    Morris as Economic Minister in summer 1982. The Department concurred, and I
                    received the assignment as Economic Counselor. In the spring, Mike Boerner was
                    medically evacuated to Washington, and I took over the Economic Counselor's slot
                    on an acting basis. Then Bob Morris departed post on schedule so that within the
                    space of five weeks I went from being Energy Attach� to Acting Economic
                    Minister. Over the course of my tour in London, I would eventually serve as
                    Acting Economic Minister for over a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then eventually there was a new Economic
                        Minister?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>DEAL: The new Economic Minister, Jim Stroymayer, arrived in the fall of '82.
                    Before his arrival, we had the huge controversy with the British and our other
                    allies over the proposed Soviet natural gas pipeline to Western Europe.
                    Following the Versailles Economic Summit, the Reagan Administration had imposed
                    economic sanctions to stop the pipeline. British firms such as John Browne had a
                    big stake in the project, and the U.S. through extraterritorial measures
                    attempted to block their activities in the USSR. This became the most serious
                    rift in U.S.-UK relations for many years and threatened to end the “era of good
                    feeling' between the Thatcher and Reagan Administrations. Prime Minister
                    Thatcher was outraged by the decision and made her views known loudly and
                    often.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Directly to the President too, do you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Directly, I'm sure. It was a very difficult period for us in the Embassy.
                    The British press was absolutely rabid about the issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were dealing, not just with British government, but
                        with the British business community and press as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes. I had the misfortune of having to inform the Chairman of John Brown
                    about the sanctions, and he practically exploded out of his chair. The
                    Ambassador and DCM entrusted me with press briefings to explain the rationale
                    for the decision. The loonier parts of the British press concocted incredible
                    conspiracy theories and put me in the center of the plot. I certainly learned a
                    lot about dealing with the foreign press.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What other major issues were there during those
                        years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Throughout my tour in the UK, we continued to have serious differences with
                    the British over the extraterritorial application of U.S. laws. The Soviet
                    pipeline episode was the prime example, but earlier fights over U.S. antitrust
                    activities had led Britain to pass legislation in the late 1970's, the
                    Protection of Trading Interests Act (PTIA), which, when invoked, blocked the
                    application of U.S. laws on British companies or British subsidiaries of
                    American companies. The British invoked the PTIA during the Soviet pipeline
                    dispute.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>Another sensitive extraterritorial issue that infuriated Prime Minister Thatcher
                    was the Laker anti-trust case. This involved an alleged conspiracy by U.S. and
                    European airlines to do in Laker Airlines, whose low prices were cutting into
                    their market share. The conspiracy supposedly took place in Florida. It involved
                    a meeting among airline officials who reached agreement to tell Boeing and
                    Airbus, the principal aircraft suppliers, that if they continued to provide
                    generous leasing arrangements to Laker, then the carriers would not buy aircraft
                    from them any longer.</p>
                <p>The Justice Department launched a criminal antitrust investigation. The Embassy
                    needed to be informed about developments in the investigation including hearings
                    before a Grand Jury. But the judge in the case would not allow the transmission
                    of information to the Embassy through normal State Department channels because
                    too many people would have access to grand jury information. So there was a
                    special arrangement whereby a designated person in the European Bureau at State
                    would pass on the information to me personally, and I could brief the Ambassador
                    and the DCM, but no one else including the Economic Minister. Ultimately, on the
                    advice of the DCM and me, the Ambassador called President Reagan and asked him
                    to terminate the antitrust investigation, which he eventually did. It was only
                    the second time in American history that a President had overturned a Justice
                    Department criminal antitrust investigation.</p>
                <p>Extraterritorial disputes continued to plague the bilateral relationship. We were
                    concerned not only about past disputes such as the pipeline and Laker, but
                    ongoing negotiations over money-laundering in places like the Cayman Islands
                    where such matters as bank secrecy and intelligence-sharing were important
                    considerations. Consequently, I worked with an Assistant Secretary in the
                    British Foreign Office to develop a procedural solution to the problem. We
                    eventually came up with the idea of a “hotline” between the Deputy Secretary of
                    State and his counterpart in the British Foreign Office to provide the other
                    side advance warning of a possible extraterritorial dispute.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, you were Acting Economic Minister and Economic
                        Counselor, which is kind of the number two position in the economic world of
                        the embassy in London. There are sections and agencies within the economic
                        portfolio. Did you have to spend a lot of time coordinating, administering,
                        and managing all of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes, in the Economic Counselor's job I had four sections reporting to me.
                    When I served as Acting Economic Minister, I had a general supervisory
                    responsibility for other agencies as well. My dealings with other agencies, such
                    as Treasury, were cordial. I don't recall any particular problems with the other
                    agencies; things generally went smoothly. Again, I had two stints as Acting
                    Economic Minister once in 1982 and again in 1983 after Jim Stromayer became ill
                    and eventually died.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, I was starting to ask whether there were many issues
                        involving the Economic Section of the Embassy that related to the British
                        role in the European community of the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Not very much. That was not an issue we followed that closely. Of course,
                    Britain's role in the European Community has always been a sensitive political
                    problem, and we did a certain amount of reporting on Britain's demands for
                    compensation from the EC budget, for example. But as far as the larger
                    Trans-Atlantic issues involving the EC and the U.S., we primarily had a watching
                    brief.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course the other thing that anybody who has served in
                        Embassy London ever, and certainly during this period like all other
                        periods, is that you had a lot of visitors and that took up a lot of your
                        time and energy. Were those opportunities, as you saw them, more than
                        handicaps or difficulties?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Well, they were time-consuming and painful, at times, but, for the most
                    part, I think they were rewarding and interesting. You did meet some people that
                    you would not normally have contact with, both private individuals, as well as
                    Members of Congress. And Administration visitors were frequent, of course. A
                    post such as London will always have its share of official visitors and, while
                    burdensome, they are also necessary and worthwhile.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was ambassador to Cyprus at that time ('81 to '84), and
                        Bob Hopper was in the political section, I guess he was my main point of
                        contact when I came through several times, because it was far easier to get
                        to Cyprus through London than any other way. I was there for a
                        Chiefs-of-Missions conference, I think it was December of '83, and Secretary
                        Shultz was there. I think that was the first time I had seen him in action.
                        I was very impressed with how he conducted that meeting.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>DEAL: Speaking of Secretary Shultz, I want to recall a meeting he had with Prime
                    Minister Thatcher shortly after I had taken over as Acting Economic Minister in
                    1982. Before the ill-fated Versailles Economic Summit, which led to the Soviet
                    pipeline fiasco, President Reagan sent George Shultz to G-7 capitals to consult
                    with leaders in advance of the summit. On my first day as Acting Economic
                    Minister, we had a briefing for him and drinks with Ambassador Lewis. The next
                    day I accompanied Shultz to the Prime Minister's residence at Chequers to meet
                    with Mrs. Thatcher and the Economic team in her cabinet. It was the first time
                    that I had seen Mrs. Thatcher in action. We arrived at Chequers ahead of the
                    Ambassador, because she wanted to meet with George Shultz alone. When we
                    arrived, she said very cordially to her Private Secretary, Michael Scholar,
                    “Michael, why don't you take George's friend (meaning me) and show him around,
                    and George and I will talk about this matter of the economic summit”. And they
                    met alone about an hour. At that point, she rushed out the room where they had
                    been meeting with a copy of the draft Economic Summit communiqu� and ran up to
                    the Secretary of the Cabinet, Robert Armstrong, and said “Robert, the 'Japs'
                    aren't going to get away with this again! I want the language changed in this
                    communiqu�!” Then she immediately turned on her charms and greeted her Ministers
                    and the Ambassador. I was really taken aback by her performance on that
                    occasion. We then had a working lunch. During the lunch a number of helicopters
                    started landing on the front lawn of Chequers carrying members of the War
                    Cabinet. Mrs. Thatcher excused herself and said that she would turn the meeting
                    over to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Geoffrey Howe, since she had to go
                    upstairs and meet with the war cabinet. The Chequers meeting took place while
                    the Falklands War was underway. At the time, I thought it had something to do
                    with the decision to sink the Argentine battleship, the Belgrano, but Michael
                    Scholar subsequently told me it was about another important military matter, but
                    not the Belgrano.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It certainly was related to the Falklands War?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think George Shultz, in his book, devotes quite a number
                        of pages to that trip he took for President Reagan, and I think it was not
                        too longer afterwards that he was asked to become Secretary of State.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: That's right. It was just a few weeks later that he got the call, when,
                    ironically enough, he was back in London on a private visit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, anything else about London?</hi>

                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>DEAL: Well, I worked very closely with the DCM, Ed Streator, throughout my tour.
                    He had a small group that met every Monday in his office to plan the weeks'
                    reporting, and I took part in those meetings. In addition, Ed and His wife
                    Priscilla hosted some wonderful representational dinners. Jill and I took every
                    opportunity to attend these affairs, even on one day's notice, when, for
                    example, one of the guests had dropped out. We met some fantastic people there
                    and learned from the Streators a style of entertaining that we put to good use
                    when I returned to London as DCM in 1992. In Ed's final year as DCM there, he
                    was under consideration for a number of ambassadorial appointments and finally
                    accepted the ambassadorship to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
                    Development (OECD) mission in Paris. By training and interest, he had been a
                    Political-Military Officer, but he had picked up a lot of economics during his
                    stay in London. We talked a lot about the job, and when he was called back to
                    Washington, he asked me to draft a paper about a possible new U.S. approach to
                    the OECD.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the record, what does OECD stand for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. It is the
                    successor organization to the one that implemented the Marshall Plan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Based in Paris?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Based in Paris. So, I drafted the program for him. He liked it and took it
                    back with him to Washington. It was eventually approved by Allen Wallis, the
                    Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs. It became the roadmap for the
                    kinds of initiatives that we would take at the OECD. And it was at this time
                    that Ed asked me if I would be his DCM at the OECD mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he had been DCM in London for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: I think it was almost seven years. He left in '84 and went to Paris, and so
                    in my last year Ray Seitz was DCM. I worked very closely with him on a lot of
                    those extraterritorial questions that I mentioned earlier,</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, do you want to say anything more about London or is
                        that pretty well it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: That's pretty well it. Certainly from a personal standpoint, it was my most
                    rewarding overseas assignment. And London was great for my family. It was a
                    wonderful time, and I was lucky to spend four years there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Jill had employment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: She had a difficult time finding a job initially, but she got the rare
                    opportunity to work for a British company, GEC (the British General Electric), a
                    major defense and telecommunications company. Initially, she worked on a
                    part-time basis, but it quickly became a full-time job in their legal department
                    providing help with their American subsidiaries and working directly for the
                    General Counsel of the firm.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your children liked the school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes. They both attended the American School in London. My oldest son,
                    Chris, graduated from the American School, and my youngest son, Bart, went
                    through the four years of middle school there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And even though it's the American school in London, they
                        probably know something about the British system and...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Some. I don't think they had any special classes on British politics or
                    society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: O levels or A levels or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then you went as Deputy U.S. representative to the OECD
                        in Paris in the summer of '85.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Ed Streator was the U.S. representative, the
                        Ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now there have traditionally been two deputies in that
                        mission.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: There was such an arrangement in the past, but by the time I arrived there
                    was only one Deputy. There was a senior Treasury officer in the mission, and at
                    times past, the Treasury person had been the DCM.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now Ed Streator had already been there a year when you
                        arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Right. In 1984 and 1985, my first year at post, we tried to put in place
                    the reforms recommended in the roadmap.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, some of those things had already gotten started?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Ed had brought an official from the Labor Department on a detail to deal
                    with the structural reforms including budget and program priorities. So, yes,
                    much had already been done by the time of my arrival. I spent the vast majority
                    of my time there on management issues, running the mission, and dealing with my
                    counterparts in the other G-7 countries. We had an informal consultative network
                    among the G-7 countries at the OECD. Probably the most difficult job I had was
                    overseeing our relationship with COCOM [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral
                    Export Controls], which was also located in Paris. That was the organization
                    that dealt with Western export controls to the Soviet Union and Eastern
                    Europe.Relations with the Secretary General, who was an Italian, were especially
                    prickly because of the hard-line stance the U.S. had adopted on the export
                    control issue at the behest of the Defense Department. While I could not do much
                    about the policy, I did try to make our working relations with the Secretary
                    General and other COCOM countries as smooth as possible given the high priority
                    the Administration had attached to the export control question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did COCOM come to be the responsibility of the U.S.
                        Mission to the OECD?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: I don't the origin of this setup. Certainly, COCOM could have been the
                    responsibility of the Embassy Paris, but, in fact, it fell to the U.S.
                    Ambassador to the OECD. American officers at COCOM were listed as members of the
                    U.S. Mission to the OECD, even though they didn't work there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Paris club? Did that come under the
                        OECD?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: No, I certainly saw a lot of people from State and other agencies dealing
                    with the Paris Cub debt issues, but we had no responsibility for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that's true of UNESCO [United Nations Educational,
                        Scientific and Cultural Organization] too?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>DEAL: Yes. It was an entirely separate mission, which closed its doors in 1985
                    because of the U.S. withdrawal from UNESCO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about relations between the OECD mission and the
                        Embassy Paris; did you have to spend much time on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: I did because the Embassy provided all our administrative support. So on
                    matters of housing, assignments of personnel, finance, etc. we had to work very
                    closely with the Administrative Section of the Embassy and the DCM there as
                    well. We had a very good, cordial relationship. It would be easy in certain
                    situations to end up as a second-class citizen, but that was never the case with
                    Embassy Paris. We got all the support we needed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the other traditional functions of the OECD is
                        related to the coordination of developed country positions in trade
                        negotiations and other international economic issues. You mentioned you were
                        part of a group of G-7 country representatives that would work together. Did
                        you get into trade negotiations during much of that period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Well, the OECD is one of those international organizations where the real
                    players come from capitals, not the mission to the organization. Much of the
                    coordination and consultation that we had with other country representatives,
                    including the G-7, primarily involved approaches being developed in
                    capitals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Secretary General of the OECD when you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Jean-Claude Paye. He was a very senior French economic diplomat. He was
                    distinguished, impressive, and intelligent. Among other things, he had been
                    Chairman of the Paris Club and the equivalent of our Under Secretary for
                    Economic Affairs in the French Foreign Ministry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And was there a senior American on the OECD secretariat as
                        well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes, Jack Myerson. Traditionally there has been an American Deputy
                    Secretary General at the OECD. We kept in contact and he was supportive of our
                    reform initiatives. He was also helpful with the perennial budget problems that
                    the U.S. has with international organizations.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From 1973 to1975, I was Economic Counselor in Switzerland
                        in Bern, and at that time, there was something called the ECSS [the
                        Executive Committee in Special Session] of the OECD, and it happened to be
                        chaired at the time by a Swiss official. I remember meeting with him fairly
                        often on issues related to that body; I don't know if that continued during
                        your time there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: It continued, and it had a fairly high profile at one time. But by the time
                    I had arrived at the OECD, it had lost much of its importance. I believe that as
                    the Economic Summit process became more formalized with numerous preparatory
                    meetings, G-7 Summit teams took up the work previously carried out by the
                    ECSS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned before that much of what happens at the OECD
                        involved people from capitals that come to the meetings and served on the
                        committee. Did you feel at times that you were basically running a travel
                        agency or hotel service for visitors, or could you and the Mission be
                        involved in substance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: It was difficult to take part in any meaningful substantive work. In
                    general, I believe it is difficult to be a diplomatic mission to a think-tank or
                    to have much of a role in the policy debates at home. To the extent you have
                    good relations with the agencies in Washington, you can play a useful supporting
                    role, and I think we did. We had good working relations in Paris with our
                    counterparts in other missions at all levels. However, the real players came
                    from capitals, and it was our primary responsibility to help them prepare for
                    those meetings and support them while in Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, anything else you want to say about your time there
                        from '85 to '88? Was Ed Streator the Ambassador throughout that period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: No, he was there for the first two years, and then Denis Lamb replaced him
                    in my final year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Denis Lamb had similar background to you, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes, he was an Economic Officer with extensive experience at the OECD.</p>

                <p>DEAL: Not only in Washington, he had also served on the staff of the U.S. Mission

                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Well, I should mention that we lived in a beautiful apartment overlooking
                    the Bois de Boulogne. After leaving London, Jill took a position with Rogers and
                    Wells, a law firm with which she was associated until 1992. Chris went off to
                    the University of California at San Diego. Bart attended the American School in
                    Paris. We had some good times in France, especially one summer vacation in
                    Provence, but after three years I was ready to leave.</p>

                <p>DEAL: I came back as Director of the Office of Eastern European and Yugoslav
                    affairs (EUR/EEY). I put in bids for that position as well as Director of the
                    Office of Regional Political and Economic Affairs (EUR/RPE). But I wanted a
                    break from economic issues so my strong preference was for EUR/EEY. Tom Simons
                    was the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Eastern European and Soviet affairs. We
                    had worked together in Poland. He was in the Political Section while I was in
                    the Economic Section. So, they welcomed me with open arms in that job. During
                    the last few months of my stay in Paris, I went on an official visit to
                    countries in Eastern Europe where I had not been before, namely Yugoslavia,
                    Bulgaria, and Romania.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, this was not too long before a lot of things happened,
                        but I don't know to what extent you were anticipating the fall of the Berlin
                        wall and all that happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Well, we certainly weren't anticipating change of that magnitude. However,
                    in the fall of 1988 the Polish government began negotiations with Solidarity in
                    what became known as the Roundtable Talks. I visited Warsaw in November 1988
                    just as the talks were about to begin. It was around that time that I asked my
                    desk officers for Poland to develop a set of initiatives that we might announce
                    in the event of a breakthrough in these talks.</p>
                <p>I had intended to stay in the EEY job for two years, although hoping I might be
                    chosen at some point for a Deputy Assistant Secretary position in the European
                    Bureau. But the election in 1988 changed all that. Brent Scowcroft and Bob Gates
                    were back at the NSC. Bob and I had been colleagues together on the NSC staff in
                    1976-78. I contacted Bob, who offered me a position in the International
                    Economic Directorate of the NSC. Of course, I really wanted to be the head of
                    that directorate. Bob told me that they planned to hire a banker to head the
                    office, but that he would need someone like me with policy experience. That made
                    the position more attractive, and I thought there always the chance that the
                    appointment of the banker might fall through. While on the face of it, this
                    might have appeared as a sideways move from a career standpoint, I thought it
                    was worth the risk. I accepted the offer and returned to the NSC for a third
                    time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And when was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: March 1989.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, before we leave Eastern European and Yugoslav
                        Affairs in the Department, let me just ask you whether you had contemplated
                        a program to deal with political change in the other countries of Eastern
                        Europe in addition to Poland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: While I was at State the primary focus of attention was Poland, although
                    the effort expanded to other countries after I left the Department. I should
                    mention a few other things. At NATO in the fall of 1988, I co-authored the U.S.
                    contribution to a NATO study, which established the principle of conditionality
                    in Eastern Europe, that is, political and economic reforms must go hand in hand
                    to win Western financial support. That became the policy that helped shape the
                    NATO and Economic Summits of 1989. In January 1989, I accompanied Senators
                    Hatfield and McClure on a visit to the “bad guys” of Eastern Europe, Bulgaria,
                    Romania, and Czechoslovakia. In that same month, Tom Simons initiated a policy
                    review towards Yugoslavia, because there were already rumblings of major
                    political change in Yugoslavia, but not necessarily of a positive nature.
                    Milosevic was talking in jingoist terms about a Greater Serbia. However, I left
                    the Department before completion of the study.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, anything else about your time in Eastern European and
                        Yugoslavia Affairs; that was not very long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: No, I was in the Department for only nine months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then for the third time, as you said, you went to the
                        National Security Council, and how did that job evolve or develop? Initially
                        you were a deputy to this banker?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Well, the banker never took the position. He may have decided not to go
                    through all the hassle of paperwork and security clearances. So for one month
                    then I was acting head of the Economic Directorate. In April, Deane Hoffman, who
                    was a CIA officer serving on the National Intelligence Council, took over as
                    Senior Director. From the start, relations with him proved very difficult, and
                    matters would come to a head in the fall.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>On arrival at the NSC in March 1989, the first thing I did was to pick up the
                    work I had initiated at State dealing with Poland and the other countries of
                    Eastern Europe on a possible U.S. response to political change in the region. I
                    worked closely with Bob Blackwill and Condi Rice in the European directorate of
                    the NSC on an economic aid package. (I had to work behind the back of Hoffman
                    because he favored an entirely different approach to political change in Eastern
                    Europe). We obtained approval for a $100 million program for Poland, which
                    eventually became the Polish-American Enterprise Fund. The objective of the Fund
                    was to help fledging entrepreneurs launch private sector projects in the
                    country. Similar funds were subsequently established for Hungary and
                    Czechoslovakia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did there need to be American involvement in particular
                        projects to receive financing from this fund?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Well, there was a board that consisted of individuals selected on the basis
                    of their experience in banking, finance, and development. They were the ones who
                    approved the projects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there didn't need to be an American partner in a
                        particular enterprise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: No, the notion was really to give a boost to private Polish enterprises,
                    which were just beginning to emerge in the wake of the collapse of
                    Communism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the program worked well, did it not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: It worked extremely well in the case of Poland, but was less successful in
                    Hungary and Czechoslovakia. The $100 million in the Polish Fund has been repaid
                    many times over and the money channeled into other investments. This was one of
                    those rare instances in government work where you could see concretely the end
                    result of a policy initiative you had started.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the timing couldn't have been better.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: No, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's come back to the bureaucratics of what you were
                        doing. You mentioned the person who had come from the CIA. Did you
                        eventually then take that position?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>DEAL: Well, as I said earlier, relations with Hoffman were difficult at the best
                    of times. We had fundamental differences over how to respond to political change
                    in Eastern Europe and the USSR. I had had to work behind his back on the
                    Polish-American Enterprise Fund. In September, my mother died unexpectedly, and
                    I had to go to California to deal with disposal of her remains and her house.
                    When I came back, the working situation became even worse. Finally, I went to
                    Bob Gates, the Deputy National Security Advisor and said “Bob, I'm sorry, this
                    is just not working out. I'll stay until March (one year) and then move on; it's
                    not your fault, I just can't work with this fellow”. And he said, “Hold on a
                    minute. We've got some changes in mind. Don't do anything yet. Just wait a bit”.
                    About three weeks later, as I recall, one of Hoffman's initiatives was to
                    dispatch a team of American businessmen and American officials to Poland to talk
                    about private enterprise and doing business in the post-Communist world. I
                    believe he actually obtained approval for the idea, but then on his own, without
                    clearing it with Brent Scowcroft or Bob Gates, he ordered an aircraft to take
                    the businessmen and officials to Poland. That was enough. Brent fired him that
                    afternoon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your boss?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes. So once again I became Acting Senior Director. After three weeks or
                    so, Brent called me at home, and said, “I'd like you to be Special Assistant to
                    the President and Senior Director for Economic Affairs”. That was in November of
                    1989.</p>
                <p>I was given authority to hire my staff. I kept Eric Melby, who had worked on
                    trade issues on the NSC staff in both the Reagan and Bush Administrations. I
                    hired Rich Barth from Commerce to handle export controls and technology
                    transfer. And Treasury agreed to detail Meg Lundsager to my office to deal with
                    debt matters and foreign assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that point you were involved in far more than just
                        European matters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: That is correct. One of the main functions of that position was to be part
                    of the three-member team for economic summits. I became one of the “Sous
                    Sherpas” for the economic summits. I was the White House person on the team. The
                    Sherpa was Dick McCormack, the Undersecretary for Economic Affairs at State, and
                    the third person on the team was David Mulford, the Undersecretary for
                    International Affairs at Treasury.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you would meet periodically with your counterparts
                        from the other G-7 countries in preparation for the summits?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: We usually had four or five preparatory meetings per year.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, we're resuming the foreign affairs history interview
                        with Tim Deal, Timothy E. Deal. It's May 19, 2005. We're picking up after
                        about a three-month interval. Tim, I think we were talking last time about
                        your assignment as Special Assistant to the President at the White House, as
                        Senior Director of the International Economic Affairs directorate of the
                        National Security Council (NSC) from 1989 to 1992. I would suggest we talk
                        about a couple of things: one, the preparations for the Group of Seven (G-7)
                        summits. I think we did talk some about that; I don't know if there's
                        anything more that we can say about that first, and then secondly, about
                        your responsibilities during the Gulf War and the role that you played
                        there. So, maybe we can start out briefly talking about the G-7 economic
                        summits.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: I participated in the preparations for three summits: Houston, London, and
                    Munich. I attended two summits, but missed Munich because I had left the NSC by
                    then. The advance preparations usually involved four or five preparatory
                    meetings to establish the agenda and begin drafting work on the summit
                    communiqu�. I think the Houston summit was especially interesting in that we
                    were the hosts. As a result, we had responsibility for organizing the event and
                    drafting the communiqu�, a truly tedious process, as I came to learn. In any
                    event, by the time of the Houston Summit, we had resolved most of the
                    contentious issues with the exception of trade issues and the environment. We
                    reached agreement with our G-7 partners on the trade issues under the good
                    leadership of Jules Katz, who was brought down from Washington to assist in this
                    effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was, at the time, Deputy Special Trade
                        Representative?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: That's correct, he was number two in the U.S. Trade Representative's office
                    under Ambassador Hills. I took the responsibility for coordinating the
                    communiqu� language on the environment. We had problems there with both the UK
                    and Germany. On the first day of the summit, I had a working dinner with the
                    German Sherpa team. We reached an agreement on compromise language, which, for
                    our part, included an initiative on forests, a Presidential objective. The
                    British learned of our deal and were greatly annoyed that we did not include
                    them in the process. Negotiations on the environmental language lasted all night
                    the day before the summit was to end. At the end of this negotiating session we
                    still had some “bracketed language” (i.e. differences of opinion), which we had
                    to leave to the G-7 leaders themselves to resolve. The next morning, Prime
                    Minister Thatcher took the lead in the discussions, proposing compromise
                    language that we had submitted. So the meeting broke up on a positive note.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you a question about Houston before I forget
                        about it. You were not really involved in the logistical, physical
                        arrangements, the social events of the schedule, things like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: No, that's right. A business executive, Fred Malik, took on the
                    organizational responsibilities, working with the City of Houston and local
                    civic organizations.</p>

                        year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: The Houston summit was 1990. In 1991 the summit was in London. Bob Zoellick
                    had replaced Dick McCormack as the Sherpa. We had four or five preparatory
                    meetings and went through a process similar to the 1990 cycle. The only
                    difference this time was that the G-7 leaders had invited Soviet leader
                    Gorbachev to take part. So there was a G-7 meeting that covered the traditional
                    issues. Then Gorbachev joined the G-7 leaders and made a presentation on the
                    Soviet economy. Russia has since become a regular participant in the Summit
                    process and this year (2005) is acting as host.</p>
                <p>The next year, 1992, was in Munich; as I said, I didn't participate in the summit
                    itself, only in the preparatory meetings. The Germans used the summit process to
                    highlight the importance of unification.I think most notable, to me at least,
                    was not so much the substance of the discussions, but the opportunity to see
                    parts of East Berlin and Eastern Germany that had been, in effect, off limits to
                    Americans. One meeting took place in what had been the official residence of
                    former German Democratic Republic (GDR) President, Eric Honecker.</p>

                <p>DEAL: It was in the city of Berlin proper. Our wives did have a tour of Potsdam.
                    There is a tradition that spouses of the Sherpa teams are invited to one of the
                    preparatory meetings. In 1991, that special meeting was in Hong Kong. In 1992,
                    it was in Berlin. In any event, my wife saw some interesting sights, while we
                    haggled over communiqu� language. They passed by the Soviet army barracks. Jill
                    reported that it was a horrible, sad-looking place with Soviet soldiers waiting
                    to be repatriated to Russia. The Russians appeared to be stringing out the
                    process, while the Germans wanted them out as soon as possible.</p>
                <p>The last summit preparatory meeting I attended was in R�gen, a Baltic Island that
                    had been part of the GDR. We stayed in what had been guest quarters for high
                    party officials. The local citizenry looked on this summit troupe as if we were
                    from another planet.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>In the end, I was glad to be moving on. The summit process is exhausting; and I
                    really question whether these events are worth the effort. Summit preparations
                    tended to involve four or five overseas trips in the space of a three-month
                    period. They always occurred over weekends. So you ended up dragging yourself
                    into the office on Monday, when everyone else was fresh from a weekend
                    break.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else that you wanted to say about the
                        economic summit process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: While not really part of the summit process per se, I should say something
                    about the negotiations in early 1990 to establish the European Bank for
                    Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) since the U.S. Sherpa team conducted those
                    negotiations with staff support from State and Treasury. The EBRD was a French
                    initiative led by President Mitterrand's close aide Jacques Attali. We met four
                    or five times in early 1990 (on top of all the summit preparatory meetings!) to
                    negotiate the Articles of Agreement and decide the Presidency and location of
                    the bank.</p>
                <p>It was quiet a spectacle to see representatives from former Communist countries
                    sitting around a negotiating table with their Western counterparts as well as
                    some “unreconstructed types” from the Soviet Union. Lively discussions ensued
                    when, for example, the Czechoslovak representative, a future Finance Minister
                    and Prime Minister, offered to establish the EBRD's headquarters in Prague
                    “since we have an old Museum of Communism that we no longer need.” On another
                    occasion, a new Romanian delegation arrived to applause after the overthrow of
                    the Ceausescu regime in Bucharest.</p>
                <p>The negotiation of such issues as the Soviet right to borrow was contentious, and
                    we even had differences within our own delegation on that and other matters.</p>
                <p>The final preparatory meeting was especially unusual at least for the U.S.
                    delegation. It followed on the heels of an economic summit-planning meeting,
                    which we held in Paris to avoid duplicative travel for the Sherpa teams. The
                    last two issues subject to a vote concerned the selection of a President and the
                    location of the Bank. Attali wanted the Presidency for himself and was opposed
                    only by the former Dutch Prime Minister Onno Van Rudding. The French also wanted
                    to locate the Bank in Paris, but realized they could not have both. So the
                    compromise solution was for Attali to become President and the Bank to be
                    located in London. On the last day of the meeting, Dick McCormack claimed to be
                    exhausted from chairing the summit meeting, while David Mulford had to bow out
                    because of a scheduled trip, I believe, to Japan. As a result, I was left as
                    acting head of the U.S. delegation and cast the deciding votes for Attali and
                    London. I always wonder whether I had the legal authority to cast those votes
                    since I was only a White House Staff Member and not an Under Secretary subject
                    to Senate confirmation. Well, that is ancient history now.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's turn now to the Gulf War.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I was out in California on vacation when the Iraqis invaded Kuwait. I came back
                    to Washington and immediately sought a meeting with Bob Gates. I stressed to him
                    the potentially adverse economic implications of the invasion. It took Bob a few
                    days before he gave me the go-ahead to draft an action plan.</p>
                <p>The first thing I did was propose an interagency study on the utility of economic
                    sanctions, in other words, would they put pressure on Saddam Hussein to pull his
                    troops out of Kuwait? The Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, John Robson, took
                    charge of the effort. We worked through the Labor Day and produced a report
                    about the middle of September. Our study concluded that economic sanctions alone
                    would not drive Saddam out of Kuwait. At best, the impact of those sanctions
                    would not be felt for 12-18 months. Our political masters were not happy with
                    that conclusion so they ordered us to label the study “draft” and shelve it
                    since it was inconsistent with the Administration's public line that economic
                    sanctions would have a great impact on Iraq, perhaps obviating the need for
                    military action.</p>
                <p>Another area where I was actively involved concerned the financing of the Gulf
                    War. Toward the end of August, while the sanction study was underway, Deputy
                    National Security Advisor Bob Gates, called together a small group to look into
                    the question of providing financial aid to the front line states: Egypt, Jordan,
                    and Turkey. The group met at the Deputy Secretary level with participation by
                    State, Defense, Treasury, and OMB. Bob Gates chaired it, and I acted as its
                    Executive Secretary. We reached agreement on a plan that Treasury Secretary
                    Brady and Secretary of State Baker would make visits to allied states and seek
                    financial support for the front-line states most impacted by the invasion. Brady
                    led a team to Germany and Japan. I accompanied Secretary Baker to Egypt, Saudi
                    Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). We also met with the Kuwaiti
                    Government in exile in Taif, Saudia Arabia. During our preparations for these
                    trips, Secretary Baker came up with the idea that, in addition to seeking funds
                    for the front line states, we should seek financial support to cover our
                    military costs. That notion became part of talking points for the two trips. As
                    a result, during the final quarter of 1990, the Desert Shield phase of the
                    operation, we collected $9 billion from our Allies, Germany, Japan, Saudi
                    Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE. That figure became significant in shaping our
                    financial demands for the war itself.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>In January 1991, around the time that the air war began, there was a meeting
                    scheduled in New York between Treasury Secretary Brady and either the Japanese
                    Finance Minister or Prime Minister. The agencies agreed that we should approach
                    our allies again for financial support in the “shooting phase” of the conflict,
                    Desert Storm. Defense proposed that we ask Japan for $15 billion. State
                    suggested $6 billion. The two Departments were at loggerheads. Bob Gates asked
                    me to come up with a formula before the meeting with the Japanese. I asked OMB
                    for their estimate of the daily costs of the war. OMB gave me a ballpark
                    estimate of $500 million a day. I projected those costs forward for 90 days and
                    came up with the figure of $45 billion. I then prorated the $45 billion among
                    the five contributing allies based on what they had given in 1990. Japan's
                    contribution under this formula was $9 billion for the first quarter of 1991. I
                    sent the proposal over to Gates on a Friday afternoon. Jill and I went out to
                    eat at a Japanese restaurant that night where Gates tracked me down. He said the
                    President liked my formula and that I should get Defense and State on board the
                    next day, which I did. Our allies, especially the Germans, wondered how we came
                    up with those figures, but all ultimately paid. Thus between September 1990 and
                    March 1991 we collected $54 billion. In the first quarter of 1991, the U.S. ran
                    a current account surplus, the only time that has happened in modern times. The
                    British wanted a cut of the money we had collected from Japan to cover their
                    troop costs, but I told the UK Cabinet Office that the British would have to
                    approach the Japanese on their own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a profitable war then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Well, the contributions ultimately matched quite closely our total outlays
                    for the war. Congress became very interested in the effort and demanded that
                    Defense provide Congress a monthly accounting of the costs. Members of Congress
                    wanted to know where the money came from and how it was being spent. So the
                    Administration provided Congress monthly reports for a period of time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, the $54 billion was the combination of the $9billion
                        for Desert Shield and $45 billion for Desert Storm?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: That's correct. Since the war ended so abruptly, we did not make any
                    further fund-raising efforts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It helped that this was a clear case of aggression that
                        pretty much unified everybody across the spectrum, which was quite different
                        than Gulf War II. I don't think anybody thought very seriously about trying
                        to raise that kind of money.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>DEAL: No, I don't think such an effort would have succeeded this time. In
                    1990-91, there was great appreciation abroad that the U.S. had taken the
                    military lead. The monetary contributions were concrete evidence of that
                    international support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The discussions that you were involved with primarily
                        related to this, the financing aspect, as opposed to whether countries would
                        contribute personnel, troops...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: That's right. I was not involved in the military questions. One other thing
                    that was very much on our minds was the possible burden on the American public.
                    So, collecting the money was an essential part of that exercise. But we also
                    wanted to make sure, for example, that oil prices did not skyrocket. There was,
                    of course, a spike in oil prices immediately after the invasion, but they
                    dropped just as quickly as they rose. During the fall of 1990, we made plans for
                    drawing down the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and conducted a test run, which
                    worked well. We also coordinated with the International Energy Agency (IEA) to
                    put their emergency-sharing scheme into operation. We had these measures
                    prepositioned so that when the air war started the drawdown on the Strategic
                    Petroleum Reserve began and the IEA sharing mechanism went into effect. Prices
                    spiked again, but because of these actions, they dropped very quickly to normal
                    levels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, anything else related to the Gulf War and its
                        effects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: I don't think so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see from your notes that you headed a Vice-Presidential
                        task force that succeeded in reducing regulatory obstacles to the issuances
                        of licenses for the export of strategic goods and technologies. Could you
                        elaborate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: During the Bush Administration, I chaired the NSC's Policy Coordinating
                    Committee (PCC) on Technology Transfer, which operated at the Assistant
                    Secretary level. Shortly after taking over as Senior Director, I won approval
                    for a State Department proposal to streamline the export control list. The Joint
                    Chiefs carried out a major study of controlled technologies, which concluded
                    that many of the existing controls on dual use goods were unnecessary. Work on
                    those issues continued throughout the administration. The PCC met every two
                    weeks to deal with the technology transfer agenda. I must say that we had a
                    cordial working relationship among the agencies in contrast to the bitter wars
                    over export controls during the Reagan years.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>One major issue in the export control area that arose in 1990 concerned a Soviet
                    proposal to build a fiber optics network across the country. A U.S. and a
                    British firm were in competition for the project, which had major intelligence
                    implications. I worked closely with the Deputy in the British Cabinet Office to
                    coordinate positions. I brought together the head of the National Security
                    Administration and its British counterpart in Washington to work on a strategy.
                    Ultimately, the two governments decided to block the two companies participation
                    in the project, a decision announced by President Bush and Prime Minister
                    Thatcher.</p>
                <p>Toward the end of the Bush administration, the Vice-President was put in charge,
                    along with the Counsel to the President, Boyden Gray, of a major interagency
                    effort to streamline regulations. My contribution to that effort was a proposal
                    to simplify the export licensing process. I had a rather ambitious objective in
                    mind, which was to consolidate the various export control lists, and assign
                    licensing approvals to one agency, Commerce, because of a steady stream of
                    complaints from the business community about inordinate delays in obtaining such
                    licenses. Complaints about the State Department's handling of goods on the
                    Munitions List were particularly bitter. Unfortunately, Reggie Bartholomew, the
                    Under Secretary at State in charge of these matters, strongly objected to this
                    notion of transferring control of licenses for goods on the Munitions List to
                    Commerce. And so, my initiative, which had broad support within the White House,
                    did not lead to the degree of deregulation for which I had hoped because of
                    objections from State with the support of DOD.</p>

                <p>DEAL: One Friday morning in 1990, General Scowcroft called me over to this office
                    and said that the President had decided to “do something” to help Latin America.
                    Brent asked me to transform that very general request into a concrete program. I
                    called together a group of people at various agencies to brainstorm about a
                    possible initiative for Latin America. We came up with a list that included free
                    trade, debt relief, liberalization of investment rules, etc. and circulated a
                    framework paper to that effect. When my Sherpa colleague, Treasury Under
                    Secretary Mulford, heard about the project, he went ballistic, saying the NSC
                    should stay out of what were Treasury's line responsibilities. I didn't see how
                    free trade was a Treasury preserve, although debt relief and investment clearly
                    were that department's responsibility. In any event, Mulford got Treasury
                    Secretary Brady to intervene with General Scowcroft, and Treasury took on the
                    task of crafting the program. Treasury kept a tight lid on the project, but
                    General Scowcroft kept me in the loop and sought my advice on the various
                    proposals under consideration. Eventually, this developed into what became the
                    Enterprise for the Americas initiative. This ultimately provided the policy
                    framework for the negotiations of a Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico,
                    NAFTA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, where did you go from the White House?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Well, in my final year at the NSC I began to look at possible onward
                    assignments. One thing I had always tried to do in my Foreign Service career was
                    to pick places where Jill might have the best chance to continue her legal work.
                    She had been able to find good positions in all of my overseas assignments after
                    Warsaw. The Ambassadorial list for what would be an election year did not look
                    promising, and I knew that in many places it would difficult, if not impossible,
                    for the wife of an Ambassador to work, especially in any high-profile legal
                    position. So I thought I should look for a posting at the DCM-level at a place
                    where we both might do something interesting. London seemed the ideal choice. I
                    recalled the tenures of Ed Streator and Ray Seitz and my own previous assignment
                    there and thought the DCM's job offered the kind of intellectual and management
                    challenge that I was looking for. So at the conclusion of the Economic Summit in
                    London in 1991, I spoke with Ray Seitz, who was Ambassador there and told him of
                    my interest. He was in complete accord because he said he wanted a DCM with an
                    economic background. So the usual negotiations then began with the Department,
                    leading ultimately to my selection for the position. I went to London in the
                    summer of 1992.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, let's talk about London then.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>DEAL: In London, I had the benefit of working for two pros: Ray Seitz, who was
                    the first and only career person ever to hold the position as U.S. Ambassador to
                    the Court of St. James's, and Admiral Bill Crowe, the former Chairman of the
                    Joint Chiefs of Staff. In essence, this was a much more traditional Foreign
                    Service assignment than, for example, my tours at the NSC. In large missions
                    such as London with a staff of 500 plus, the DCM's role is overall coordinator
                    and manager. Ray Seitz, who was on his third or fourth assignment to the UK, was
                    simply the best Political Officer in the Embassy. He had impeccable contacts
                    going back to his first assignment, where he was the primary liaison with the
                    Conservative Party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And his second assignment, as I recall, to London was also
                        in the Political Section. He was very much involved in the Zimbabwe
                        negotiations and maybe some other things at that time. So, he certainly knew
                        the Foreign Office, as well as the foreign policy community.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: And he had been DCM as well. Ray was extremely well wired into all aspects
                    of the British political scene, and there was not much you could tell him about
                    the UK that he didn't already know.</p>
                <p>With Ray in the lead, we had a very talented team in the Embassy. For my part,
                    initially I was involved with some specific issues related to the Gulf War, in
                    particular, questions over the extension of the “no fly” zone in southern Iraq.
                    We had differences with the British over how far that line should go and I
                    worked very closely with Pauline Neville-Jones, who at that point was Deputy
                    Cabinet Secretary. We reached an agreement on a way to extend the line to the
                    Western border of Iraq to close any possible gaps, an issue of great concern to
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>On the representational side, I took on responsibility for increasing our
                    contacts with the Labor Party and some junior Ministers within the government
                    with whom Ray did not have much contact. That outreach paid off when Labor came
                    to power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have contact with Tony Blair?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: No, I didn't know Blair, but over my four years in London I became
                    acquainted with Labor politicians who eventually became Ministers of State in
                    Blair's government, the second echelon in most of the major Ministries.</p>
                <p>The two most important substantive issues during my watch were the Northern
                    Ireland question and Bosnia. We had quite a difficult time when the
                    administration changed after the 1992 elections. Ray Seitz was popular with the
                    American community, which joined the British government in lobbying for him to
                    stay in London. In fact, he did stay for the first eighteen months of the
                    Clinton administration, which is a true credit to his personal standing in both
                    Washington and London. In any event, he was bound to be replaced at some
                    point.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>Early in 1993, while Ray was still Ambassador, the White House under National
                    Security Advisor Tony Lake and NSC Counselor Nancy Sodeberg embarked on a new
                    approach to Northern Ireland. This approach involved direct contacts with Sinn
                    Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA). Among other things,
                    the White House took the unprecedented step of inviting Sinn Fein to St.
                    Patrick's Day events in the U.S. Such actions were very controversial in London
                    and opposed by Ray, who took the position of the British government that this
                    was a matter that needed to be solved by negotiations, but not negotiations with
                    “the terrorists”.</p>
                <p>The problems that started in Ambassador Seitz's tenure actually worsened after
                    the arrival of Admiral Crowe because the White House continued to run its own
                    Northern Ireland program with no meaningful input from State or the Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the reason for that situation partly because
                        Ambassador Seitz had made very clear his adamant opposition to that kind of
                        approach and perhaps the feeling that...I think he even publicly made known
                        his feeling...he couldn't be trusted to carry out a different approach, a
                        different policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Possibly, but the unfortunate thing is that the situation continued under
                    Admiral Crowe even though he had been selected for the Ambassador's position by
                    the President himself. Suffice it to say, this was a matter totally out of the
                    State Department's control. No one in State had any significant say in the
                    matter. The British Government had a hard time understanding that we were
                    completely out of the loop. We had some unfortunate and embarrassing incidents
                    where we were basically told by the White House to let Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein
                    use our secure phone in the Consulate in Belfast to communicate with Lake and
                    Sodeburg, conversations to which we were not a party. That was just typical of
                    the whole thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were issues of technique and style, but that is the
                        way the White House chose to operate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: That's right. On the other hand, perhaps what was done ultimately paved the
                    way for the progress on Northern Ireland that came later.Once George Mitchell
                    became involved, the process became more orderly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that was after you left, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Well, Mitchell began his mission while I was still in London.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And as DCM did you supervise the Consul General in Belfast
                        and the other posts (there aren't too many in the UK anymore)?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes, we had posts in Belfast and Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did the Consul General in Belfast figure in the
                        operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: The Embassy and the Consulate General were in full accord. Of course, the
                    Consul General's position was especially uncomfortable because he could see
                    first hand what was happening. Relations with the Protestant parties were
                    especially difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the British government was unhappy too, as you
                        indicated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they expressed that, I suppose, in different ways to
                        the White House, as well as to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes, but we heard their complaints at all levels. Traditionally, relations
                    between the White House and the Prime Minister's Office have been close, but
                    they became quite tense because of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Prime Minister at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: John Major. Again, as I said, once George Mitchell became involved in the
                    process, tensions eased. I sat in on Mitchell's initial meetings with Major and
                    his team. The British respected him and began to believe that the U.S. would be
                    more even-handed than in the first part of the Clinton Administration.</p>
                <p>Q: And the Embassy London felt that it was in the loop and more aware of what was
                    going on? . DEAL: Well, we never really felt that we were in the loop, but the
                    process was more transparent and less secretive. George Mitchell was more
                    balanced in his approach and took account of the multiplicity of interests
                    involved, not just the views of Sinn Fein.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he work out of the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes, I believe so.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, let's talk about some other things that
                        happened in the period from '92 to '96 that you were in London. I noticed
                        that there was a big staff reduction at Embassy London. What was your
                        involvement in that effort?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Well, as DCM, I, of course, oversaw the reductions, but I had the able
                    support of my Administrative Counselors. It was the usual situation: State cuts
                    back its overseas positions at the same time as other agencies are adding
                    staff.Nonetheless, we managed to reduce staff over time without really affecting
                    core operations. Both Nick Baskey and Lynn Dent, the two Administrative
                    Counselors who had primary responsibility for framing the proposals, were pros
                    and made it possible to carry out this reduction in a sensible way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talked some about your relationship with Ambassador
                        Ray Seitz. Let me ask you before we leave him, he left that position in '93,
                        early '94?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: 1994, yes. He stayed on for the first eighteen months of the Clinton
                    Administration.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, after leaving his post in the Embassy Ambassador
                        Seitz stayed in London and worked on a book on the bilateral relationship.
                        How did he conduct himself in London? Was he discreet and careful?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Absolutely. He kept out of the public eye, quietly working on his book in
                    1994-95. He never saw himself as an alternative voice of the United States in
                    London. He was very diplomatic in that regard. After the 1995, his public
                    profile increased. He gave some marvelous interviews to the BBC about U.S.-UK
                    relationship akin to Alistair Cook, but from the UK side of the ocean. By the
                    second year he also became more active in the business world. He served on a
                    number of boards and had a senior full-time position with Lehman Brothers. So,
                    as a result, we never really saw much of Ray and his wife Caroline. They did
                    give us a farewell dinner, but that was one of the few occasions that we met
                    after he left the Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And were you there when the book came out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: I am not sure when the book came out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It did attract press attention, at least certain aspects
                        of it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>DEAL: Yes, it did. Ray was especially outspoken on the subject of Northern
                    Ireland, criticizing the Administration and Ambassador Smith in Dublin for the
                    conduct of U.S. policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Admiral Crowe came in as the new ambassador in 1994. He
                        was a political supporter (fairly rare in the retired military) of Bill
                        Clinton's campaign in the 1992 election. He, of course, had been Chairman of
                        the Joints Chiefs of Staff and Commander in the Mediterranean (southern
                        command). He was very experienced. How did he set up his relationship with
                        the DCM, and how did your role change? You had been charge d'affaires, I
                        suppose, for a period of...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: About a month. Well, it was a very smooth transition. He may not have known
                    a lot about the State Department, but he certainly knew a lot about government.
                    He had worked, of course, at the highest levels of the U.S. Government and was
                    very familiar with the interagency process. He allowed me to continue to manage
                    day-to-day Embassy operations, as most DCMs do, and he chose the issues that he
                    wanted to be involved with. He took a strong interest from the start in the
                    Northern Ireland question. He functioned very much like a career Ambassador. He
                    respected the opinions of people and didn't try to run things on his own. He had
                    close contacts with John Major's government and used them to good effect. He was
                    especially active on the speaking circuit. He probably gave more speeches and
                    public appearances than most of his predecessors. He presented a good image of
                    the U.S. He was well liked and respected by the staff and the British.
                    Obviously, he did not have the rich in-country experience of Ray Seitz, but he
                    was a quick learner and very able. He was in charge of an Embassy with high
                    morale despite the personnel reductions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To what extent were you involved in defense issues such as
                        defense sales? Did that change when the former Admiral came to the
                        mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: No, our approach on advocacy efforts was the same under both Ambassadors
                    Seitz and Crowe. From the outset, I believe we needed a coordinated approach
                    within the mission to be effective. I took lead responsibility for bringing
                    together the appropriate agencies, e.g. Defense, Commerce, and deciding how we
                    could best support U.S. contractors in the competition for defense sales to the
                    British Government. In many cases, I made a direct appeal on behalf of the U.S.
                    contractor to the Ministry of Defense and Foreign Office. We were quite
                    successful in my time there, winning about four or five major competitions in
                    the defense procurement area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Most of the conversation we've had so far has been about
                        things in London. To what extent did you or others in the Embassy travel
                        around the United Kingdom?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>DEAL: Well, the Embassy staff traveled much more than I. Both Ambassador Seitz
                    and Crowe had active speaking programs throughout the country. While I made a
                    few public appearances, I felt it was my job to mind the store at home. As is
                    true of all Embassies, we tried to gather views about what was happening around
                    the country. And we used speaking opportunities to explain U.S. policy
                    priorities. Aside from Northern Ireland, we probably did less political and
                    economic reporting from the provinces than might be true in another country
                    because of the centralized nature of the British Government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned earlier that one of the reasons that
                        Ambassador Seitz was interested in you to be the DCM in '92 was because of
                        your economic background, which was obviously very extensive. I'm not sure
                        if we've talked too much about economic issues. To what extent were you
                        involved? There was a very large, and I'm sure able, economic section.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Well, I was involved, but perhaps not as deeply as I had originally
                    expected. Internal management consumed most of my time in London. I did some
                    public speaking on international economic issues. And I generally fielded the
                    requests for media comments on economic and trade issues, whereas both
                    Ambassadors tended to address political matters such as Bosnia or Northern
                    Ireland. I followed the activities and reporting from the Economic Section quite
                    closely. In my last year in London, I lost both my Economic Minister and
                    Economic Counselor due to unexpected retirements and reassignments.
                    Consequently, in addition to being DCM, I took on the role of Acting Economic
                    Minister during the last nine months of my tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you and others in the Embassy spend an awful lot of
                        time on matters related to Britain's participation in the European
                        Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: We participated in a lively debate among missions in Western Europe about
                    Britain's role in the EU. In 1994, I attended a Chief of Missions' conference in
                    Brussels in place of Ambassador Seitz, who was about ready to leave post, where
                    European integration was a major item on the agenda. Stu Eizenstat, whom I had
                    known from the Carter White House, was, as the U.S. Ambassador to EU Commission,
                    the principal spokesman for the view that deeper European economic integration
                    was in the best interest of the U.S. Perhaps, reflecting to some extent British
                    views, I tended to take the more skeptical approach supported much to my
                    surprise by Ambassador Harriman in Paris. The debate continued on and off
                    throughout my four years in the UK. I had the feeling then, as I do now, that
                    the UK does best in preserving a degree of independence from many of the
                    policies espoused by France and Germany. And I am not all sure that the U.S.
                    should endorse every European action to integrate their economies further. I
                    believe we need to look first at how U.S. interests are affected. Depending on
                    the issue, closer economic integration in Europe may or may not be good for the
                    U.S. Our support for European economic integration has deep political roots, but
                    the situation today is far different than in the 1950's when the integration
                    process was in its infancy.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that struck lots of us over the years is
                        the number of visitors that come to London. The visitor load may be greater
                        than any other embassy in the world. Do you want to say anything about that
                        in the time that you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: The visitor load was indeed heavy. We had two Presidential visits. The
                    Secretary of State came four or five times. And other Cabinet members made
                    regular appearances. But we had an experienced local staff and top-notch
                    Administrative Counselors, and most of these visits went off without a
                    hitch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good. Anything else about your four-year tour?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: I should mention something about Bosnia, the other big issue on my watch in
                    addition to Northern Ireland. EUR Assistant Secretary Holbrooke had a game plan
                    for involving DCMs in the five-Party talks on Bosnia. In principle, this was a
                    good idea, but it was difficult to execute in practice. The problem was the flow
                    of information and the tendency for Holbrooke to deal directly with the
                    Political Directors in the countries concerned. We weren't really kept in the
                    loop, although the British, and I assume others, thought we were. It was fine
                    when the meetings took place in London, but when they occurred elsewhere we
                    frequently did not know what had been discussed. It was frustrating to say the
                    least. I did host a number of meetings and working luncheons for U.S.
                    negotiating teams and their British counterparts. I believe we could have
                    contributed more actively to the promotion of U.S. policy initiatives if we had
                    been better informed. I suppose this way of doing things is the new reality in
                    American diplomacy.</p>
                <p>In any event, early in 1995, I started having heart problems once again, which,
                    after many fits and starts, led to bypass surgery in May. The illness and
                    recovery essentially sidelined me for many weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During that period, who acted as DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Tom Gewecke, the Economic Minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, anything else about London?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>DEAL: No, looking back over that time, I believe the health issue put a damper on
                    what should have been (and was) one of the most interesting jobs I've ever had.
                    The change in Ambassadors midway through my tour also was not what I had
                    expected either. Because of the Washington connections that Ray Seitz and I both
                    had, we felt much more engaged and involved in the foreign policy process during
                    the Bush Administration. The 1992 election changed that to some extent. Bill
                    Crowe had personal lines to the White House, but it was still a much more
                    difficult operating environment for the Embassy in 1993 to 1996.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it certainly could have been worse.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Of course. And you could do things in London as a DCM that you could not do
                    in many other places. You could invite people as diverse as John Cleese and P.D.
                    James to your dinner parties, and they would come willingly. The entertainment
                    side of the job proved enjoyable and rewarding. We made some lifelong friends in
                    the process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, and that ended in '96, and what happened then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: As I said earlier, I knew that in not seeking an ambassadorial assignment
                    in 1991-92 that the position in London would likely to be my last Foreign
                    Service assignment since I was not likely to be promoted to Career Minister from
                    that job, no matter how large or important the mission. I expected it to be my
                    last post and it was. So during my last few months in London, I started thinking
                    about the future. I returned to Washington in June 1996. I took the Department's
                    outplacement course and, while at the Foreign Service Institute, lined up future
                    employment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you've been Senior Vice-President of the U.S. Council
                        for International Business in Washington since 1996?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEAL: Yes. I retired from State on August 31, 1996, and began work the next day
                    as head of the Washington office of the U.S. Council. I am also on the Board of
                    Directors for two life insurance companies that are subsidiaries of a major
                    British insurer. The Directors' positions flowed from contacts made with the
                    British business community during my time in London.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, well, thank you very much Tim. I've enjoyed these
                        conversations, and sorry that it's taken this long. I see that our first
                        conversation was in November 2004; well, we haven't done too badly. I've
                        taken two years for some others. Thank you very much; I'll stop here.</hi>
