                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like you to start this interview by giving me your
                        name, where you were born, went to school, etc. Why you chose to go into the
                        Air Force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: OK, a biographical sketch, just hitting the high spots. My name is Anthony
                    Joseph Perna. I was born in Jersey City, New Jersey in 1918 of Italian-American
                    parents. I spent my youth on Long Island and got my elementary education in a
                    rural area called Commack. Subsequently went to Mineola, another rural area and
                    graduated from High School in Mineola in 1935. I was an average student,
                    interested in average subjects, and keen about golf as a hobby. I was a product
                    of the depression days and had to work for a couple of years before I was able
                    to enter Syracuse University. I began at Syracuse in '39, and was a member of
                    the class of 1941. In this period of my life, I became enamored with a local
                    girl, Betty (Silliman) and enjoyed two years of her company while at Syracuse as
                    a freshman and sophomore. I was majoring in Spanish and in advertising working
                    toward a commercial degree and hoping to go to Latin America, with a
                    qualification in Spanish, and get hooked up with the Otis Elevator Company (to
                    which my family had some connections). When Betty graduated in '39, I returned
                    for my junior year. I was self employed and self supporting. I worked in a
                    sorority house as a houseman, maintaining the house, keeping the furnace,
                    waiting on tables, and doing the bidding of the housemother. This provided me
                    with my board, and for my room, I worked in the University library stacking
                    books. I had various odd jobs for making money and was able to support myself.
                    In my junior year, I was feeling the pains of my loved one being on Long Island,
                    and I decided in 1939 that I wanted to be with her and wanted to get married. I
                    went to Long Island on a visit and decided that we couldn't manage it for
                    financial reasons and I, at that time, investigated the opportunity of going
                    into the Air Force. I subsequently signed up, took a temporary job on a
                    newspaper selling advertising, and waited until the spring of 1940, when I got
                    my appointment as a flying cadet. I joined the United States Army Air Corps,
                    went off to Tulsa, Oklahoma where I began my primary flying training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were in the Air Force through the war, really?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>PERNA: This began in 1940, a year before the war, and I graduated on December 20
                    of 1940, married December 22 and spent all '41 as a flying instructor on bombers
                    until Pearl Harbor Day, December 7, 1941. At this time, because of my experience
                    in bombers, I was sent to a base in Florida at Sebring, called Hendricks Field,
                    where we began the first B-17 school and, I, because of my experience with heavy
                    bombers, became a pilot instructor at Sebring, and then commander of the
                    instructor school. It was here that we were training pilots and co-pilots to fly
                    B-17s. They left us and went to an operational training unit where they got
                    their navigators, bombardiers and gunners and eventually went off to the 8th Air
                    Force in England.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you never went overseas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: I did not at that time. I stayed in the training business from 1941, the
                    beginning of World War II up until 1944. I went about the country opening up
                    additional B-17 schools. I eventually went to the headquarters of the Training
                    Command up in Fort Worth and supervised these 4 engine bomber schools. We had 4
                    B-24 and 4 B-17 schools. I spent a lot of time doing anti- submarine work in the
                    two years we were in Florida. This was a period when the German wolf packs of
                    submarines had control of the shipping lanes from Galveston/Houston, all the way
                    to Bayonne, New Jersey. We were working with the Navy trying to suppress this
                    submarine threat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Along the coastline of the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: Along the coastline of the Gulf Coast and up the Atlantic coast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within how many miles were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: They were close enough that on some occasions, when we would sink one, and
                    they found in the personal effects of the crew that they had theater stubs from
                    Miami, and from Palm Beach, where they had come ashore at night in rubber boats,
                    spent a few days on the beach, and then gone back and joined their boat. They
                    had complete control of the shipping lanes. We were successful in getting a few
                    of them and we had a few airplanes that were shot up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They could very well have come and invaded the United
                        States at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>PERNA: Well, in the case of Jekyll Island, GA where a great many American
                    millionaires had their homes, the War Department insisted that these wealthy and
                    famous Americans be evacuated because they were fearful that the submarines
                    could come and take them hostage. As a result, they all left the island in a
                    caretaker status. And this happened on many resort areas along the coast. You
                    will see even now the remnants of towers, and gun emplacements, and lookout
                    positions for submarines on the Maryland coast, the Long Island coast, and all
                    down through the Carolinas, still remnants of this period of '42, '43, when the
                    wolfpacks were so successful. But we had our taste of combat getting shot at by
                    submarines while we were trying to get them with depth charges. But we were
                    primarily in the training business, and we would assign so many airplanes each
                    day to the Navy to supplement their search program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you go overseas then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: I went overseas in the end of the war and it was again in a training
                    capacity. I had moved through the B-17s and the B-24s and then up to the B-29s.
                    The B-29, you'll remember, is a super fortress and we had over a thousand of
                    them stationed on Guam, Tinian, and Saipan. This is where they mounted the
                    offense against the Japanese homeland and began a systematic strategic bombing
                    of population centers as well as strategic targets of petroleum, oils,
                    lubricants, communications, and defense positions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you in the Far East?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: I was out there in a training capacity. I was running one of the B-29
                    schools, and I went over to represent the training command with the users, the
                    Commander of the 21st Air Force, General LeMay. We worked on providing what they
                    wanted in the replacement crews. We were school teachers and, parenthetically, I
                    would tell you that this was very ironic the way it worked. When we got picked
                    as school teachers, we were picked originally because we had the highest grades
                    in our class, and the people who had less proficiency, pardon my braggadocio,
                    but, they would be sent to combat. They kept the best ones as we were
                    instructing and we needed more instructors. We didn't keep the poorer students
                    to be instructors, we kept the best ones and sent the other guys overseas. The
                    ones we sent and who went to war were back in a year, covered with decorations,
                    and about two grades higher, but also many of them were killed. So it was a
                    strange thing, and many of the guys who worked for me cursed us because we were
                    keeping them in a permanent training establishment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Keeping them from promotion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: Keeping them from promotion and keeping them from going to war, and they
                    were all young and full of vinegar and wanted to get in to it. And so it
                    was.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>I wound up as a Staff Director of B-17 and B-24 programs, and then I got a B-29
                    school, and I was a Commander of a B-29 school at Denver, Colorado. At the end
                    of the war, in '44, '45, we were in the Marianas talking with the user agency
                    which was the 21st Air Force. (Incidentally, I just came home from this
                    conference out in Seattle which was a reunion of all the B-29 people that the
                    Boeing people had in August of 1992 celebrating what the B-29 did for the United
                    States and what the people in the B-29 flying business did and what the people
                    in Boeing did to win the cold war with this airplane.)</p>
                <p>The war ended in August '46, the war ended in August '45 when they dropped the
                    bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In January 1946, a couple months later, I joined
                    the unit that had dropped the bomb, and I became Deputy of the 509th Composite
                    Bomb Wing. We organized a program to go to an island called Kwajalein in the
                    Pacific in the Marshall Islands where we set up the Bikini bomb test. The Bikini
                    bomb test was called Operations Crossroads. This was a program to detonate a
                    nuclear weapon under scientifically controlled and test condition. The ones we
                    had detonated heretofore was the test one in White Sands (the first one that
                    went off), and then the second one was the one we dropped on Hiroshima, and the
                    third one was dropped on Nagasaki. There was no test data to speak of, so we set
                    up this test program and dropped one from an airplane onto a target ship, the
                    Nevada. We had a whole fleet of navy vessels, a whole bunch of army buildings,
                    and army materiel, including guns and tanks, etc...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To be destroyed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: Everything to be tested, to see what happened when you dropped a nuclear
                    weapon. We dropped from 30,000 feet. I did not fly the airplane that dropped it.
                    I was flying an airplane around the target site and I had what we call blast
                    gauges in my airplane. When we came down to the point that they were going to
                    release the bomb, I released these blast gauges. Other pilots with other bombers
                    like mine released blast gauges and with telemetering equipment and radio
                    transmission they were able to record the blast and the data scientifically so
                    that they could find out at various altitudes how much intensity you had from
                    the burst of the bomb.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How far away were you from the blast?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: I was eleven miles slant range. When the bomb went off here and I was
                    eleven miles at 28,000 feet. We wore goggles for fear of retina damage to the
                    eyes. When the shock wave hit us the whole airplane jerked. It felt like someone
                    took a tremendous plank and slammed it against the airplane, and this was at ll
                    miles.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>Well, we stayed out there for the second shot which was where we put a weapon on
                    a tower again up at the Bikini lagoon and we set it off on a tower about 200
                    feet above the ground.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was how much later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: This was just a matter of weeks, a month later. We did a test in April and
                    May, and then we came home in the summer. We had to produce all the scientific
                    data and recording material that we had. We had a tremendous array of
                    instrumentation from Los Alamos and from all the scientific community in
                    America, including some of the scientific colleges. These people were under
                    contract to the War Department and recording the data to see what would happen.
                    We had animals, we had materiel, we had structures, we had medicines, we had
                    everything you can think of that somebody wanted to see what were the effects of
                    a nuclear detonation. This was a very impressive moment in my life and I was
                    convinced when I saw the thing go off that you could never use these. Then I
                    spent the rest of my life hauling them around as part of the deterrent against
                    the Russians. But I was convinced when I saw that one go off that this was not
                    the answer for mankind. But we used the threat of them as a successful
                    deterrent.</p>
                <p>This Kwajalein “Crossroads” duty with the 509th lasted until the summer when we
                    got our data together, then packed up and came back to Roswell, N.M. and
                    Washington and turned in our report. I delivered the Air Force report called
                    “The employment of nuclear weapons by the US Air Force” to the Air Force
                    headquarters. This was Top Secret in those days.</p>
                <p>A lot of service politics were involved and interesting at the time. The weapons
                    had large explosive charges put in a casing, they called them “Fatman.” The
                    Fatman was probably 5 or 6 feet high, probably 8 or 10 feet long. In the core of
                    it was where the uranium went. This was the material that caused the fission,
                    but to make it detonate you had to have an implosion of all the high explosives.
                    When it exploded inward, it made the U235 go critical, and you caused the
                    fission phenomena. The ingredients U235 capsule that went inside was controlled
                    by the Navy. We had a Navy Admiral on board our Air Force airplane, Admiral
                    Parsons, who was the man who had inserted it on the flight to Hiroshima. So the
                    Air Force did not have control of the whole thing, the Navy had control of the
                    critical ingredients of the bomb, and he had to wait until we took off, and when
                    we got in flight ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was inserted in flight?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: It was inserted in flight, when you were at low altitude and didn't need
                    oxygen to get in the bomb bay to put the thing in. This was a very interesting
                    period. We had everybody in the world out there looking at the test.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you mean by that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: Well, all kinds of foreign diplomats, allies but there were no Russians
                    there, but we had lots of the scientific community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was for Bikini?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: This was for Bikini. We had lots of Asians, and all of our European allies
                    were there. As a Deputy of the Composite Bomb Wing that was doing it, we were
                    deeply involved in meeting all of these people, and helping. It was an
                    interesting time to rub shoulders with the highest level of the scientific
                    community in America who were all out there. Teller, and you name any of them,
                    they all went out to see the shot, and see it themselves.</p>
                <p>At the conclusion of these tests, I had the opportunity to take the exams for the
                    regular Air Force. I was a reservist, I was not in the regular Air Force. I got
                    a reserve commission when I got my wings back in 1940. I took the exams and
                    passed them and I got into the regular Air Force. As soon as I got my regular
                    commission, they gave me the opportunity to go back to college and finish my
                    degree, provided I'd take what they wanted. The Air Force wanted aeronautical
                    engineers, they wanted physicists, they wanted chemical engineers, they wanted
                    electrical engineers, and they had one spot open in political science,
                    international relations, and it was at Syracuse, Maxwell School of Citizenship.
                    I was able to finagle the appointment there. I went back to Syracuse, and they
                    gave me two years, but I only stayed for a year and a half, and I got my
                    Bachelor's degree in Political Science. By this time, I had three children. They
                    were born during the process of World War II while I was training people in
                    B-17s, and my son was born in Syracuse, when I was a student finishing my
                    undergraduate work. I was the Commandant of all the military students who were
                    there. The Army, Navy, and the Marine Corp had students going to school also. I
                    was the baby sitter for all of them and had to make arrangements with the
                    University, etc. We had to appear and perform certain functions for national
                    holidays, etc.</p>
                <p>At the conclusion of my studies, I went into Strategic Air Command and very
                    briefly, I was a Base Commander at Spokane, with B- 29s, and I was a Squadron
                    Commander at Spokane with B-29s, and this is in the period starting in '48.</p>
                <p>I went to England and became a Base Commander at Lakenheath, and then at
                    Mildenhall. This was interesting because, when Khrushchev closed access to the
                    city of Berlin and blockaded it, our government decided that we would feed and
                    supply the city by air. We commenced what was called the Berlin airlift.
                    Coincident with it, we put B-29 bombers in England and took our weapons with us.
                    We hauled these old weapons I described for you, “Fatman.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nuclear?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: Nuclear weapons to England in 1948. This has now become public knowledge,
                    but at the time, no one knew it, except a very few people. It was closely
                    guarded. However, it was leaked to the Russians, so the Russians knew it. The
                    way it came about was that Truman and his Chief of Air Staff, (Hoyt) Vandenberg,
                    and Attlee, the Prime Minister of England, and his Chief of the Royal Air Force,
                    a guy named Lord (Tedder), the four of them got together without any staff, and
                    they agreed that they would do this. Congress did not know it, Parliament did
                    not know it. It was an agreement between the two Heads of State with their two
                    Air Force chiefs. They went ahead and did it, and eventually told the rest of
                    the people, in the State Department, and in the Defense Department, “We're doing
                    it.” We moved about six squadrons of these B-29s over to England. We'd keep them
                    there 90 days and then replace them with other squadrons—this went on for 24
                    months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was President at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: Truman. They took their weapons with them. We went to these World War II
                    airfields and had to reopen them and it was chaotic. It was like the movie
                    “Twelve O'Clock High” going back to a base and having to start the thing up
                    again. I was the Commander in one of these bases for a year, then I went to the
                    base next door, and commanded it. I worked in the Headquarters initially as the
                    Plans Officer setting the thing up with a General by the name of Leon Johnson.
                    It was a very exciting time, organizing the USAF reinvasion of England with
                    their Air Ministry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you participate in the airlift?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: Yes. Our job was to hold this deterrent over the Russians' head by having
                    the B-29 capability to bomb out of England. We had to set up a depot to repair
                    the airplanes that were flying the airlift, those were the C54 transports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They came to your base?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: They came over to Burtonwood which was near us where they repaired them.
                    Our job was to provide deterrents to make the Russians stop being any worse than
                    they were. After the Berlin airlift got their production up to like 20,000 tons
                    a day, the Russians threw the hat in and said: “OK” and they opened up the
                    autobahns, and they opened up the canals for barge traffic, and they opened up
                    the railroads and life went on. The B-29 deterrent in England and the Berlin
                    airlift were successful.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you went back to the States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: I stayed there until '51, went back to the States. I went through the Air
                    Force Staff College at Norfolk. It's a joint college for people then up at the
                    Lieutenant Colonel, Colonel level. I had been promoted to Colonel when I was in
                    England as Base Commander. I had ten years' service and I made Colonel, then for
                    the next twenty years, I stayed Colonel. Got it quickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you became eventually Attach� to the Embassy in Tel
                        Aviv. Did you request that, how did that happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: Well, to fill you in very quickly, I came home and went to the Air Staff,
                    and I ran the training aids business ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The training what? Excuse me.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: Training equipment, training aids. They call them “special training
                    devices.” Training aids are all kinds of props and equipment, including films,
                    manuals, cutaways of engineering systems in the airplane, and simulators. I was
                    successful in introducing simulators at that time into the Air Staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which are...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: Simulators are replicas of the cockpit of the airplane which generate all
                    the responses you get when you are flying the airplane. You put the crews in the
                    simulators and they can perform all the functions of starting, taking off,
                    etc...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For training purposes?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>PERNA: Yes. And you can have them lose a couple of engines and see if they're
                    able to cope with flying the airplane. But when they crash, you just put all the
                    computers back and start over again. The simulators have become very, very
                    successful. They are used by everybody including the Atomic Energy Commission
                    where they simulate the control rooms at our nuclear power plants. The Navy uses
                    them for simulating the nuclear submarine control. You do all this critical
                    training on the simulator where with several mechanisms and with digital
                    computers, you simulate the responses of the instruments or the feel of the
                    airplane in order to give beginners a chance to learn without wrecking the
                    equipment. I was instrumental in getting these into the Air Staff and getting
                    them into the Air Force, and I got a lot of good publicity from doing this.</p>
                <p>I then went to SAC and became Wing Commander of a B-47 Wing. These are jet
                    bombers with 6 engines. This was in the period of John Foster Dulles and
                    Eisenhower with their foreign policy of deterrence. Hold the club over the
                    Russians and make them behave. SAC was built up to be a preeminent elite force
                    for the entire Defense Department at that time, and I was Commander of one of
                    the Wings. We had 20 some Wings that were on alert day and night, some airplanes
                    in the air, some airplanes at the end of the runway all ready to go, all
                    equipped with nuclear weapons. It was very pressure filled business. You were at
                    the end of a phone all the time. I had good success. I had one Wing at Abilene,
                    Texas, and I moved from there to El Paso, and I had a Wing at El Paso, and then
                    I came back to Abilene, and took that one over again. I was enjoying great
                    success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A Wing comprises what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: 48 bombers and 20 tankers. These are airplanes comparable to ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tankers that refill in flight?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>PERNA: In flight. The tankers are 707 type, and the bombers were B-47 and B-52.
                    These are like Jumbo Jets and like 707s that you know in commercial aviation. I
                    was running the Wing that had these. I got in to the diplomatic business because
                    I left SAC. I left SAC due to an unfortunate incident. One of our crews had
                    dropped a nuclear weapon into a swamp near Florence, South Carolina, and the
                    press was so severe on it that Eisenhower ordered the air force to stop flying
                    these weapons. Stop! And we did stop. It interfered with our training greatly
                    because the crews needed, as you turn people over, to get acquainted with
                    handling the bomb, and you need to practice, practice. We did radar bombing,
                    pretending we were going to bomb Denver, or Los Angeles, or New York, and we had
                    a bombing scoring site down there, a radar site who would track us coming and we
                    released the signal, and the signal was interrupted, that was when we would have
                    released the bomb. Knowing all the ballistic data, they would know where the
                    bomb would have hit, and was it successful or not. We were graded on this. LeMay
                    did a tremendous job in building the efficiency of this Strategic Air Command
                    force. He was a tremendous organizer and a great leader and he took good care of
                    his people. He got housing for his enlisted men and housing for the officers,
                    and he got spot promotions, and made it a real elite force. We were very proud.
                    In any event we were prohibited from flying the weapons because of this incident
                    in Florence and it was hurting our training badly. General LeMay prevailed upon
                    the Commander in Chief, Eisenhower, to let us go back to training. I was picked
                    with my unit to fly the first mission after we had stood down for about 3
                    months. I had everybody in the country and the Air Force looking over my
                    shoulders seeing what I was doing and how I was doing it. I decided I was going
                    to fly the mission myself. I had a lot of time in the airplane and I was an
                    instructor pilot and I wasn't going to leave it to anybody else. So I spent the
                    night in the alert facility next to the end of the runway in order that we could
                    leap up when the bell went off, run and jump in the airplane and be off in less
                    than 15 minutes with these mammoth airplanes. We would have the airplane
                    “cocked” as we called it, do everything possible up to starting the engines,
                    buckling your parachute, and shutting the canopy, and disconnecting the power,
                    and go. We did all of this. We had to put “JATO” on, jet assisted take off
                    rocket bottles in order that we could be sure to get off in hot weather
                    conditions with the load we had. We had wing tip tanks, we had the full body
                    tanks, and we had the bombs in the bomb bay. We had to use the “JATO” to be sure
                    we could get off the ground in case we had the alert to go in the middle of the
                    day when it was hot and it took you a long, long run to get enough speed to take
                    off. So, after great haranguing by everybody looking over my shoulder, we
                    finally went to bed and next morning at seven thirty in the morning, they called
                    the alert, “Go” and we went. We had five airplanes that were to go and fly a
                    simulated bombing mission. I was No. 1, and I was off and gone in thirteen
                    minutes. The No. 2 man behind me was off and gone. The No. 3 man, as he was
                    taking off ... What you would do was bring the airplane up to full power, six of
                    these jet engines, let the brakes go, and when you get to 75 knots, you would
                    hit the JATO bottle switch, and then these 15 rockets that were strapped to the
                    back of the airplane would give this tremendous blast to shoot you up, like the
                    space vehicles use rockets to get them up. When he fired his rockets at 75
                    knots, the tower called him and said: “You're on fire. The whole back of your
                    airplane is on fire. Bail out, bail out.” I could hear this. I was out starting
                    a turn, to pick them up in the turn after take off. This fellow's name was
                    Youngmark who was flying it, he was a Major. As it turned out, he never heard
                    the tower, but the co-pilot in the back seat could see the reflection of the
                    fire on their tip tanks, and the reflection made him look and he saw it was on
                    fire, and they said: “Bail out, bail out.” They got up to about six hundred
                    feet, and exploded the canopy off, and the two of them ejected. They have big
                    cartridges under the seat that shoot you up these rails and you go out, and then
                    your parachute opens automatically. The guy in the front ejected downward, and
                    he got his chute open, but the guy who was in the aisle who didn't have an
                    ejection seat, he never got out. The three of them got out and their parachutes
                    blossomed, and the airplane went down, and crashed on the end of the runway.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>What had happened was that my flying safety officer had an 8 millimeter camera
                    and he was out there taking pictures of these airplanes taking off, very, very
                    spectacular. Tremendous clouds of white smoke when the rockets are lit, and the
                    airplanes going up like this. Interesting to see, fun to see, and everybody on
                    the base knew it was going to happen, and they were there to watch it. And he
                    had an 8mm camera, and the 8mm camera showed that when this guy fired the
                    rockets, one of the rockets exploded and blew open the back of the airplane and
                    ignited the jet fuel, and then all the other bottles went flying. The fifteen
                    were flying around like rockets on their own going in every direction. It was a
                    materiel failure because of the rocket case rupturing when it ignited. But to
                    make a long story short ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that aborted this mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: Yes. We went to a neighboring base over in Fort Worth, and landed, then I
                    came back. Then everybody in the Air Force descended on us because it was so
                    embarrassing. Not only had we killed a man, but we had gone to the President to
                    get permission to do this, and the first time we do it, it turns to “glue.” It
                    was a function of the JATO bottle exploding. Well, I collected some “scars” from
                    this one, and although I was exonerated, that it was not a supervisory error,
                    and it was not command error, it was materiel failure, I had a good premonition
                    that it was a good time to leave the Strategic Air Command.</p>
                <p>They gave me the opportunity to say where I wanted to go, and I said I wanted to
                    go to Paris, if I could take my family. They gave me the Strategic Air Command
                    post in Paris, which was a job to provide the NATO Commander with American air
                    strikes if the war ever began. We allocated so many mission to NATO from our war
                    plan, and I was the guy who was the in between the American massive effort of
                    how many we would give to the NATO authority. General (Norstad) was the
                    Commander of NATO at that time, and I had a small office, and all the
                    communications necessary to allocate him the missions. I stayed there for about
                    a year. I went through the NATO College as a member of the NATO college 16th
                    Class, in 1960.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>PERNA: This was downtown Paris, Champs de Mars, right near the Eiffel Tower. We
                    were students at the NATO college, then I was at this SAC job. Then I went to
                    work at the NATO Headquarters as a military representative to the Secretary
                    General of the NATO organization. Paul Henri Spaak was then the Secretary
                    General and he had a military structure called the “Standing Group.” I was the
                    American member of the Standing Group in the Paris office. I stayed there for a
                    couple of years. Then I came home. I went to the National War College. (In
                    addition to graduating from the National War College in '63, I managed to get my
                    Masters degree in Political Science from George Washington University, in D.C.)
                    The NWC is where they train officers who are going to be Generals. I went from
                    there to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. At that time, Maxwell Taylor was the
                    Chairman, and McNamara was the Secretary of Defense, and Kennedy's
                    administration had arrived. I was the officer in charge of the NATO desk. I
                    prepared the papers for the Joint Chiefs on NATO subjects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the Pentagon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: At the Pentagon. I was there for two years and hated it. It was a blind
                    alley. Very important, very high level. You're right in the middle of
                    everything, and you're at the White House, and you're in Congress, and you're
                    doing all kinds of high powered things, but there really was no future in it. It
                    was back breaking, long hard hours, and I asked the Air Force to give me another
                    job. They gave me the job in Israel to go as the Attach�. I went in 1965 and
                    came back in 1969. I had about four and a half years. I returned in December,
                    1969, then I retired in the first of the year 1970. Then I became a farmer in
                    Browntown, Virginia. And here I am.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. Let's talk more, if you don't mind about your stay
                        in Israel. How were the relations between the Arabs and the Israelis when
                        you arrived there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: First, I want to fill you in on the background of what had happened
                    previously, the war of 1948, and then the war of Suez were backgrounds to the
                    time I arrived in 1965. The Fatah was the primary arm of the Palestine
                    Liberation Organization. The PLO was established, and chartered, and headed by
                    Arafat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Already at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>PERNA: He was in the hierarchy. Whether he was in control, I'm not sure, he was
                    in control in '65. I think so. But the Fatah was running raids against the
                    Israelis and the Israelis were retaliating and it was a series of events that
                    went on until the beginning of the Six Day War. The relations between the Arabs
                    and the Israelis were poor. The Palestinians were under the control of Jordan.
                    They had large numbers of refugees in camps on the West bank. Two camps out in
                    the Jordan Valley, a big camp between Hadera and Nablus and another camp near
                    Nablus, another camp north of Jerusalem and large camps in the Gaza strip. These
                    camps were populated by the people who ran away during the war of independence
                    in 1948 and never got back. Thus from '48 until '67, almost 20 years, a whole
                    generation of people lived there. However, the ones who had education, and the
                    ones who had contacts, and the ones who had means got out and they went to work
                    in Kuwait, and they went to work in Saudi Arabia, and they went to work in other
                    Arab countries and a lot of them got integrated in Jordan and in Lebanon. These
                    Palestinians were skilled and they were well educated by comparison to the other
                    people, so they didn't have trouble finding jobs in these places. In modern
                    times, in Desert Storm, they had large numbers of Palestinians still working in
                    Kuwait. Anyway these refugee camps were being run by the United Nations who fed,
                    housed, and educated them, and ran schools and health clinics. The people who
                    were in there were the people who had no skills to sell, who were economically
                    and socially down the ladder, and interested in going back to Haifa, and back to
                    Jaffa, and back to the farms where they had been before. It was very sad with
                    miserable conditions. Why they stayed was in part because the hostage policy of
                    the Arab governments to keep them there in order that international opinion
                    would be on their side. The Arab governments believed that these people must be
                    given the opportunity to go back where they came from.</p>
                <p>The terrorists came from these refugee camps. It was a place where people had
                    nothing, and the kids joined radical movements. It wasn't like someone who had a
                    business and who had a lot to lose, he was not going to let his kid go out
                    bombing an Israeli train or a bus because he'd have a great deal to lose. The
                    ones in the refugee camps didn't have much to lose. Recruiters looking for
                    terrorists got them from refugee camps. Anyway, it was not a good situation and
                    the tensions were high and the Israelis were on guard all the time around this
                    green line border. Events leading up to the six day war were... Before I go to
                    that, I wanted to say something about the question of how the Israelis managed
                    to prevail when they were so small in numbers against these vastly superior
                    numerical forces. At this time the Arabs had large inventories of Soviet
                    munitions, aircraft, tanks, and artillery. The policy of the Soviet Union
                    spreading communism was to use military sales. They were deep into Egypt with
                    large numbers of Soviet advisors. They had equipped the Egyptian Air Force with
                    MiGs and the Syrian Air Force with MiGs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the Israelis as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>PERNA: No, the Israelis had all French aircraft. De Gaulle had sold them
                    trainers, he had sold them transports, he had sold them helicopters and
                    fighters. They had numbers that were numerically inferior. In the case of
                    airplanes, the Arabs in each country outnumbered them like five to one. And in
                    tanks, they were outnumbered four to one numerically. If the Egyptians had one
                    thousand, the Israelis had several hundred. Well, how could the Israelis succeed
                    with these kinds of numbers. They succeeded in my judgment because they had no
                    alternatives. If they didn't succeed, they were finished. So they had to win.
                    This motivated the people to be ingenious, to be brave, to do their homework,
                    and to work like hell preparing for the worst eventuality. They got all kinds of
                    junk armaments left over from World War II and brought them to Israel with the
                    help of Jewish friends in Europe and in America, and they refurbished them.
                    These were Sherman tanks. They got all kinds of weapons carriers, half-tracks,
                    that they gathered up that were junk from WWII left over and they refurbished
                    them. And they used them in the Suez war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were buying this in different countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: Buying them from junk dealers and there was no prohibition on this. And we
                    didn't care. As a consequence, their determination made up for their inferiority
                    in numbers. And they prevailed in these two wars, the War of Independence and
                    the War of Suez. When we get to 1967, the Arabs were now heavily armed with
                    Soviet equipment. The Egyptians and the Jordanians had large amounts of British
                    equipment. Some American arms were in Jordan. The Syrians had almost 100% Soviet
                    arms and the Lebanese did not have much of a significant force. There were the
                    Saudis equipped with British and American arms. The Iraqis were equipped
                    principally with Soviet arms. The events that led up to the Six Day War, were
                    the frictions of the Palestinian problems, the refugees wanted to get back and
                    the fact that the military were getting stronger and stronger in each of these
                    countries. Nasser caused the war by moving a number of divisions, armored
                    divisions into the Sinai. He came across the Canal and brought them down as far
                    as the Gaza strip and the southern border of Israel and scared the Israelis. The
                    Syrians who had been allied with the Egyptians in the United Arab Republic were
                    now separate at the beginning of the Six Day War, but they were also
                    mobilized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Weren't they talking about the Golan Heights at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>PERNA: Yes. The Golan Heights were the mountains overlooking the Jordan Valley
                    where the Syrians had gun emplacements and tank emplacements and periodically
                    fired onto the settlements down below. The settlements had air raid shelters
                    where they all spent lots and lots of nights when they were being bombed. But
                    the crowning blow was when the Egyptians closed the straits of Tiran. The
                    straits of Tiran are at the bottom of the Gulf of Aqaba, where the Israelis have
                    a port called Elat, and that's where their shipping went out that dealt with
                    Africa and dealt with Southeast Asia. Next to Elat there's a Jordanian port of
                    Aqaba, and the gulf is called the Gulf of Aqaba. The bottom end of it, the
                    straits, are a narrow passage that control access into this gulf of Aqaba. The
                    Egyptians told the UN, who had a contingent there, to leave. These were UN
                    hangovers from Suez days, and also told the UN to get out of the Sinai. They
                    scared the Israelis sufficiently that they mobilized. Everybody in Israel is in
                    the army, women and men. The women go for two years and the men go for three
                    years and then they are on reserve duty until they become 50 years old. And
                    after 50, they become letter carriers and air raid wardens, and other
                    quasi-official helpers. But they mobilized and they took all the buses and they
                    took all the trucks and all the civilian equipment and they put together a force
                    in the Negev, facing the Egyptians across the green line. The Egyptians called
                    on the Jordanians to come in and the Jordanians came in. and the Israelis were
                    frightened enough that they fired the first shots. They preempted the Arab
                    forces that were mobilized. In the north, Syrians and Iraqis, Saudis,
                    Jordanians, and the Egyptians in the South. In the series of air strikes on June
                    6th, they caught the air forces of the Arab neighbors on the ground and
                    destroyed 95% of their air power on the ground. With control of the skies and
                    air superiority, they then proceeded to beat up the Egyptian armor and the
                    Egyptian tank battalions that were in the Sinai. Their forces crossed the border
                    and they had a big engagement there, and with control of the air they had
                    mastery of the battlefield.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there at the time, and these were French aircraft
                        they were using?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: The Israeli were using all French aircraft and they were using their
                    trainers as well. They armed the trainers with rockets, used these “fougas” as
                    tank busters ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sorry, I don't know what trainers are?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: A trainer is a plane that you use for training pilots, not normally for
                    combat, but they armed them with machine guns and with rockets and augmented the
                    Mirages, Oregans, and Mysteres. They engaged the Arab armor because they had no
                    enemy in the air. They shot up all the armored forces that were on the ground.
                    And they made quick work of the Egyptians in about 3 days and then they went to
                    the north and started up the Golan Heights and advanced to within about 35 miles
                    of Damascus; they finally got a cease fire and stopped.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PERNA: The US was pressuring them to stop and world opinion was pressuring for
                    them to stop. They agreed once they had control of the Golan Heights. Once they
                    had control of the Sinai and they had conquered the Egyptians, they did not want
                    to go to Cairo, they did not want to cross the canal. They had driven the
                    Jordanian forces back across the Jordan River and they had control of the West
                    bank. Now they had gone all the way over the Judean hills and down into the
                    Jordan Valley and they had everything. The Golan Heights, the whole Jordan
                    Valley down to Elat, all of the Sinai...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They felt protected? Their settlements were
                        protected?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: There were settlements in the north, but the Golan Heights could no longer
                    bother those because they had pushed the Syrians back, and this was a stunning
                    military success. I was there all the time. They wouldn't let me fly. I had an
                    aircraft that I leased most of the time. They made me take a baby sitter with me
                    when I flew, and I flew a lot, but I always had to take an Israeli along with
                    me, so that he could see what I was doing. They had areas where they wouldn't
                    let me go. I was in a car most of the time and on the road, watching as close as
                    I could get to the fighting. I was under fire a couple times when they were
                    bombing, and I burned up the engine in the car one day running like hell at high
                    speed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the other direction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: Yes, I was running away from some Syrian aircraft that were trying to bomb
                    Nazareth. I was right at the edge of the city.</p>
                <p>We had sent our families to Rome when we saw what was going to happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that the whole Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: No. It was an optional evacuation. A few wives stayed who didn't have
                    kids, but the ones who had children took them and went to Rome. The Embassy did
                    not come under attack, Tel Aviv did not come under attack. A few shells landed
                    in Tel Aviv when it started. The Jordanians shot some artillery to Tel Aviv, but
                    it was not consequential.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing then, aside from being shot at? You
                        were reporting?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>PERNA: Our job was observing and reporting. We had all of our Attach�s watching
                    what was going on. We were getting briefed by the Israelis and we had messages
                    from our Embassies in Lebanon and in Amman and in Cairo, and we were comparing
                    notes and we were reporting to Washington about what was going on. We had been
                    asked when the mobilization started, what we predicted. We got together in our
                    office, and with the Ambassador's approval, we said we did not think it would go
                    more than 10 days or two weeks at the outside. This was our estimate. And we
                    were very proud of the fact that we had said not more than two weeks. Actually
                    it was over in 6 days. Our reports were going in daily. Everything that we could
                    see and everything that we could hear. The Israelis were giving us briefings
                    which were canned and what they wanted to tell us. We took that and repeated
                    them and sent them in saying this had been given us by the Israeli Air Force or
                    the Foreign Liaison office or whoever gave the briefing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you say that the Israelis were pressured to have
                        a cease fire. Did that come through the Embassies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: Yes. The mechanics of why they stopped can best be answered by the fact
                    that they had achieved their objectives, that is to get rid of the threat of the
                    forces that had mobilized on their borders, and once they got rid of the threat
                    they had no reason to go on. They had no objectives of going to Damascus, or
                    going to Cairo. So they had achieved their objectives. We were of course trying
                    to stop them before it ever started. It was against our interest to have war
                    anywhere, and we tried to inhibit them. It had little effect. But once they
                    achieved their objectives, they stopped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, they were in the Sinai, and they had the Golan
                        Heights, and they stayed there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: Yes, and the West Bank up to the Jordan River. And unfortunately, large
                    numbers of Palestinian fled during the Six Day War across into Jordan, and into
                    Syria, and into Lebanon, and into Egypt and they further populated the refugee
                    camps. A case can be made why didn't these countries move those people out of
                    the camps and absorb them. However, they wanted them to go back to the land
                    where they had come from. This has been the source of friction down through the
                    years.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>The period following the Six Day War was complicated because De Gaulle didn't
                    want them to go to war, and De Gaulle had told them that if they began fighting,
                    he was going to shut off all their supplies. Their tanks, their aircrafts, and
                    their supplies were French. He said: “You will get no supplies if you go to
                    war.” And they went to war. He shut them off and set up an embargo on all
                    supplies. Following the Six Day War, they could get no French supplies. This is
                    when they came to us and begged us to sell them arms. We had given them some
                    help with anti-aircraft missiles, these were Hawk missiles, to intercept
                    aircraft, low flying aircraft. We had sold them some Hawks, and subsequently, we
                    sold them some A4s, which were fighter bombers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were no nuclear weapons at that time in the
                        area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: We don't know, the Israeli nuclear capability. Let me put it aside for a
                    minute, and I'll get to it in a little while. But on the arms situation ...
                    because they were dependent on French supplies, they had no way to get arms from
                    anybody, once De Gaulle had shut them off, so they came to us, and we did not
                    want to sell them arms. We did not want to sell them because we had friends in
                    the moderate Arabs countries, and we didn't want to destroy the sources of our
                    oil, and our other strategic interests in the area. We were reluctant to arm the
                    Israelis with American equipment. However, the American policy had been that,
                    from the time of Truman, in 1948, when we first recognized them, we supported
                    the concept that the US believed in the integrity and supported the integrity of
                    the state of Israel. This was from the time of their declaration of
                    independence, when the country was partitioned between Arabs and Jews, and we
                    said that we supported the territorial integrity of the state of Israel. Our
                    concept, strategically, how we would support them, was to try to prevent wars,
                    and if the war started, we would try to stop the war by interceding. This was a
                    bankrupt policy. There's no way you can get in between the forces that had large
                    amounts of Soviet armor and the Israelis with their armor, and try to say: “Stop
                    boys.” It won't work. The Ambassador discussed this at length with the Attach�s
                    and we convinced him that if the United States wanted to preserve the
                    territorial integrity of the state of Israel, we needed to give them the
                    opportunity to buy weapons in order to take care of themselves, so that we
                    didn't have to try and come at the eleventh hour to try and help them. The
                    policy changed after the Six Day War when De Gaulle put an embargo on things
                    they needed. The Russians rapidly rearmed Syria and rapidly rearmed Egypt, with
                    airplanes and tanks and artillery. The Ambassador recommended that the US supply
                    arms and the State Department and the Defense Department vetoed it. However, the
                    White House approved it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this came from the Embassy in Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>PERNA: In Israel, yes. We recommended it, and the State Department and the
                    Defense Department disapproved it, but the White House approved. And we began a
                    program of selling them selected weapons. The first big sale was the F4 fighter.
                    A lot of things happened at the end of the Six Day War. We were fighting in
                    Vietnam and we wanted to know as much as we could about Soviet armament, and we
                    were successful in getting access to a whole series of really important weapons
                    that our Army and Air Force, and Navy wanted to know about. The SA2, that's a
                    surface to air missile that had high altitude capability. The Soviet tanks,
                    their modern tanks. In this period, they were equipping the Vietnamese, the Viet
                    Cong, and the Chinese. The Israelis had radar, and artillery and a lot of stuff
                    that we were interested in, that were captured during the Six Day War. We were
                    successful in arranging for Americans to exploit this material and to know how
                    it worked. Some of it was sent to America and some was examined and exploited in
                    Israel by teams that came in. We were extremely busy in the hardware business.
                    Not only in setting up a procurement program for American stuff to be sold to
                    them, but by exploiting the Soviet equipment which the Israelis had captured
                    during the Six Day War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did some people come over from the States then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: We had teams, Army and Navy and Air Force teams that came, and they
                    examined the captured material. Some of the material, we shipped back to the
                    States. They examined it, and studied it at centers that we had for this
                    purpose. It was a bonanza for the army in particular to get access to these
                    Soviet radars, and Soviet missiles, artillery and armor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And so the Israelis released this to the US?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: Under a great deal of pressure and bargaining, by very tough business
                    deals. “Yes, we'll let you have it, but we want this, and this, and this in
                    exchange.” They would have a lot of trading that went on and a lot of it got to
                    the point where I couldn't help, and sent them to Washington. They went over
                    there, and thrashed it out. Because all I could do was to be a messenger boy and
                    take the messages. “Would you give these guys a certain kind of radar, and
                    they'll give us a MiG 15.” I couldn't make these decisions. We got the thing
                    going and sat back and watched, and it worked well, exchanging vast amounts of
                    materiel. The Israelis also took all of this captured equipment and refurbished
                    it and put the Israeli Star of David on it and they now are still equipped with
                    Soviet tanks which they captured.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was an exciting time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>PERNA: It was exciting. The sad part of it was that the refugees who were now,
                    probably doubled in numbers because of the number of Palestinians who ran away
                    during the Six Day War. These poor, unfortunate, poorly educated, low skilled
                    people were the ones who got trapped, often with large families and they're now
                    in the camps since 1967. The UN passed a number of resolutions, 242 was the big
                    one. 242 said that the Israelis should give back the territory of captured land
                    from the Six Day War, and that the Arabs should recognize secure borders for
                    Israel. Well, the Arabs wouldn't even recognize the existence of the state. They
                    had boycotted any business that did business with Israel, they wouldn't do
                    business with them and they just pretended that the state didn't exist. They
                    would not recognize there was a state of Israel. There was a whole series of
                    events going on at this time in the UN passing resolutions about how you do this
                    and you do that in terms of trying to clean up the aftermath of the war. The
                    Israeli occupied the Golan Heights to about 18 miles. And the UN put a buffer
                    zone between Syria and the Israelis, and set up observation posts ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: UN observation posts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: Yes, and they were staffed by people who were non-partisan, so to speak, a
                    lot of Danes, a lot of Scandinavians. They established a border with the
                    Egyptians along the Red Sea, in the Sinai, and the UN was there observing. The
                    Israelis held the Sinai and of course they held it until Sadat and Begin many
                    years later in 1978 agreed at Camp David to give back the Sinai for peace with
                    the Egyptians. That's another chapter, but the immediate aftermath of the war
                    was a great flurry of UN activities. Attempts to bring these refugee people
                    back, there were fights in Israel on who could come back and join families and
                    who couldn't. There were hardliners who wanted to kick them all out, forever,
                    and there were others who said, this is no good, you've got to live with them,
                    you've got to let them come back and they fought the thing on a case by case
                    basis. Sometimes families were reunited and came back...</p>

                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>PERNA: Yes, there was terrorism in '68 and '69, and there were a number of things
                    connected with the war that should be mentioned. One was the fact, that we had a
                    communications ship like the Pueblo, which was captured in Korea. We had a
                    communications eavesdropper, a spy ship called the Liberty which was in the
                    Eastern Mediterranean and which the Israelis bombed and strafed and killed
                    several dozens Americans, I think 35 or 36 Americans on this ship. This was on
                    the second day of hostilities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was an American Navy ship?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: This was an American ship. Actually it was run by the American
                    intelligence people, NSA. They had staffs of Navy people and they were from the
                    agency that was involved in listening, not only to the Soviets, but to
                    everybody. That was their business. The Israelis claimed that it was mistaken
                    identity. In the heat of battle, the heat of war, they thought it was Egyptian.
                    They did not think it was American. They thought it was Egyptian and they had
                    some bad “snafus” in their control center, one team changing and another team
                    coming on, failed to tell the team coming on that there was a plot of a target
                    out there that had been recorded previously. And in the confusion, the next time
                    it was sighted they said it was unidentified. And the Israeli Air Force attacked
                    it and before they stopped, they had shot it up and killed some 35 people. The
                    Israeli government apologized profusely, and said it was a mix up, it was not
                    deliberate. It was an error, they were sorry, and they promised recompense, etc.
                    This has been a bone of contention down through the years and journalists have
                    tried very hard to make a case both on television and in the printed journalism
                    that the Israelis did it deliberately. Our position at the Embassy after sending
                    my Naval Attach� out there and flying over in an helicopter and doing everything
                    that we could, and checking with the Ambassador, we reported to Washington that
                    we had no grounds upon which to dispute the statements that the Israeli
                    government made. It was an official government position that they had made a
                    mistake and that it was an error in the heat of war, and that they were sorry.
                    They admitted it and said that they would pay the damage, which they ultimately
                    did. But the case has never ended. There is still a lot of people, including
                    families of the wounded and of the fatalities who believe that it is legitimate
                    to make a case that this was done deliberately. I accepted the Israeli
                    position.</p>
                <p>But in saying that I accept their explanation on the Liberty case, I would make
                    this kind of a general qualifier. The Israelis could do anything, no matter how
                    bad it embarrasses us, and no matter how bad it insults us, if they think it's
                    in their own national interest, if they think it's a big enough issue, in their
                    own national interest, and we get a black eye from it, they will do it. And so
                    will we, and so will any country. This is not restricted to the Israelis. But it
                    was a bad episode. The ship limped off west under its own power, and they got
                    the casualties off, and the Navy came to rescue them, etc.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>The period following the Six Day War was equally deeply involved with the UN
                    resolutions: Would they give back this? and would they give back that?” etc. And
                    a quick synopsis goes like this. The Arab countries would not recognize any
                    boundaries other than the original green line that existed when the Six Day War
                    began. The green line was decided on the island of Rhodes in 1948, and the
                    Israelis said no way will we go back. They have an area in the middle of the
                    country where there is only 11 miles from the green line to the ocean and this
                    separates Haifa and the Galilee from the plains of Sharon and down to Tel Aviv.
                    The plains of Sharon is the coastal area going down to Tel Aviv and then further
                    south towards Beersheba and Jerusalem. But that 11 mile area they will never
                    have again.</p>
                <p>Jerusalem, they will never have divided again. Jerusalem, they have made their
                    capital and they have built big apartment complexes all around in areas which
                    had been Arab. We don't have our Embassy in Jerusalem. Our Embassy is in Tel
                    Aviv. Most other countries have their Embassies in Jerusalem. But the Brits and
                    the French are still in Tel Aviv and I think the Germans and some of the other
                    NATO allies are still there. The Soviets of course left at the beginning of the
                    Six Day War and they're just now reestablishing diplomatic relations. They
                    haven't had them since 67, but they're about to renew them.</p>
                <p>But the city of Jerusalem is never going to be divided again. The Israelis will
                    go to war over it. And although there are large numbers of Arabs living in
                    Jerusalem, there's a whole Arab sector in the old city and Bethlehem is Arab
                    completely. To my knowledge there are no Jews living in Bethlehem. But in the
                    area of Jerusalem there are large populations in areas where they have apartment
                    complexes, shopping centers, libraries, swimming pools, hospitals, schools,
                    etc.There are about six of these areas around the city.</p>

                <p>The West Bank has the Israeli settlements, as you know, for various reasons.
                    Those zealots who wanted to force the Arabs out are trying to do it by building
                    settlements and pushing them. Those who are militarily oriented want the
                    settlements to be in positions to stop any attack that might come in the future,
                    principally on the high ground, strategic positions, and along the Jordan River.
                    Since Rabin came to power, (and I know him well, he was Chief of Staff during
                    the Six Day War. I entertained him at home lots of times, traveled with him)
                    he's more of a dove than Shamir who was a hawk. He's talking now, and there's a
                    possibility that he will negotiate an interim government for five years, give
                    the Palestinians some kind of a police force of their own and permit them to run
                    their own infrastructure. Presently, the Israeli military takes care of the
                    roads, and the communications, and the electricity and all that. They will give
                    that over to the Palestinians and they will give them some measure of self rule.
                    They won't let them have military defense, military self-defense, although they
                    will let them have a police force. We're talking about a three thousand man
                    police force. The Israelis will control foreign relations. They won't let the
                    Palestinian run foreign relations. But everything else, they will let them do
                    themselves. Run their own jurisprudence system, run their own tax system, run
                    everything themselves. And they've stopped construction on some six thousand
                    housing units. And it looks now like Rabin is going, hopefully, to push to get
                    these talks going. Baker was just there a few days ago, and the prospects are
                    that if the zealots on each side don't take too much control that there can be a
                    period of relative quiet, and this will keep the factions from raising hell.
                    There will be terrorist attacks, and there will be bombs, and there will be this
                    kind of stuff going on, still, but an interim plan is possible.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was Prime Minister when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>PERNA: When I first got there, Levi Eshkol had the Prime Minister's job as the
                    head of the Labor government. Their politics are interesting. They have 21
                    parties and the only reason they don't have more is because there are only 21
                    letters in the Hebrew alphabet and each have a letter that designates their
                    party. So if you get two Jews together, you have three opinions, and this is the
                    way it is with their politics. There are extreme left idealistic communists, who
                    have some kibbutzim who are communist. Really. I mean working communism you can
                    see. Each person according to his needs, each person gives according to his
                    abilities. Then you have extreme conservative capitalists on the other side, who
                    own cement factories, and automobile factories, aircraft factories and munitions
                    factories, who are extremely well off. And in between these two, you have a
                    whole number of grades and shades. The big party had been historically under
                    Levi Eshkol, the Labor party. He had Abba Eban as his Foreign Minister.
                    Subsequently, when he died, Golda Meir came to power, and she was a Labor party
                    candidate also. Dayan was the Minister of Defense at the time of the Six Day
                    War. He had been their representative to the peace conference in Rhodes in '48.
                    Then he had worked his way up to the Chief of Staff. He was a capable ,
                    personable, effective Minister of Defense. The Chief of Staff was Rabin. He was
                    not as effective in my judgment, as a number of his Generals. Particularly Tal,
                    and Ariel Sharon, and Al Azhar who ran the northern operation against the
                    Syrians. There were a number of very, very proficient and effective generals at
                    the two star level who made Rabin look very good. But he was not that broad
                    gauged, but he had some very good people. One of his abilities was to surround
                    himself with good people. Ezer Weizman had been the head of the Air Force and
                    built the Air Force. Rabin brought him in as an Air Force officer on the General
                    Staff as Chief of Operations. A fellow named Motti Hod became Chief of Staff of
                    the Air Force. He was a skilled tactician and very good leader. Rabin's forte
                    was the fact that he picked really good guys, but he was, on a scale of one to
                    ten, a 5 or 6. But he had generals who were 8, and 9, and 10, who were doing the
                    real things. I wasn't in on it, but the scuttlebutt was that he had had a
                    nervous breakdown in the first few days of the Six Day War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rabin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: Yes. He has recovered nicely and has become the Prime Minister.
                    Previously, he became the Ambassador in Washington. And he got into some kind of
                    disgrace when he was the Ambassador because of an honorarium being paid to him
                    and to his wife for speeches and what they were doing with the money, and so on.
                    But he's weathered all that and he's now the head of the Labor party again and
                    they won the majority with their coalition, and believe me it's a coalition.
                    It's a wall to wall coalition from the extreme right to the extreme left. All
                    these different parties, including the extremely religious guys who have a few
                    members and a few votes. And there's an ex Chief of Staff who has a party, with
                    about 6 or 8 votes, and he's got his people with him. And there's a lot of
                    problems in getting a majority, but although I haven't been there in a few
                    years, the feeling in the country seems to be that they want to find some way to
                    solve this problem of Jews and Arabs living together.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to an earlier question then. Did the Israelis
                        have nuclear weapons? How did they get them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: OK. We essentially have ended the talks on the Six Day War and the post
                    Six Day War period. We didn't dwell very much on the Yom Kippur War. I wasn't
                    there at the time, so it's second hand information that I have. We brought
                    ourselves up to date. Now, to go back and talk about the Israelis' nuclear
                    capability. To begin with the Israeli government developed a nuclear reactor at
                    a place called Dimona in the Negev desert. This is about 80 miles south of Tel
                    Aviv and it is about 30 miles southwest of Beersheba. It is out in the middle of
                    the desert. They built a compound there to develop a nuclear reactor, ostensibly
                    for the purpose of peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Throughout the world, many
                    of the nations who have the capability have built nuclear reactors. OK. With
                    this as a start, their problem was to get enriched uranium or heavy water or the
                    ingredients to make weapon grades uranium. We had an inspection procedure worked
                    out with the Israelis as well as with a number of other nations where on a
                    reciprocal basis, they were allegedly opening nuclear facilities so the world
                    could see that these were not to proliferate nuclear weapons. The Israelis
                    participated in this program. Prior to my arrival in '65, there were American
                    teams that went in to the Dimona reactor and from what they were permitted to
                    see, they concluded that it was a peaceful use of nuclear energy. They don't
                    have any power plants that are nuclear powered in Israel. They make their power
                    with coal and oil.</p>
                <p>In the period from '65 to '69, I tried very hard to find out what the Israelis
                    were doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get to visit the plant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: I did not ever get inside the plant. I flew near the area. It was a
                    prohibited area to fly over and I drove around it as close as you could get
                    without being obvious. But there was an ambivalent attitude on the part of the
                    US government which reflected itself in the policies of our Embassy. Rather than
                    pursue an aggressive spying operation to try and develop some really good, hard
                    knowledge about the Israeli capability, it was my feeling that Washington was
                    just as happy that we didn't bring this subject to a head and cause incidents
                    and cause bad feelings, etc. So I had my staff essentially lay off trying to
                    penetrate the subject overtly. This doesn't mean that we didn't do a lot of
                    collecting of ancillary and correlated information. We knew that they were
                    building missiles and we knew of certain details connected with the development
                    of the program on the Jericho. The Jericho was an intermediate range rocket
                    capable of carrying a nuclear head.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Ok, having said that, it develops over the years that the Israelis obtained
                    weapons grade materials from several unknown sources. Correspondents,
                    journalists have alleged that they got most of their help from France. The
                    reactor was built with French technical help during the period when France was a
                    principal supplier of all of Israel's armaments and supplies and equipment. The
                    French technicians who lived in Beersheba and worked at the plant were numerous.
                    There were some leaks by French civilian employees which were picked up by
                    journalists and other sources suggesting that the peaceful uses of nuclear
                    energy was not the primary mission of Dimona. It was also believed that they had
                    gone deeply underground in order to build laboratories and facilities for
                    production that were not evident when inspection teams came from the
                    International Atomic Energy Commission to look and see what was going on. It was
                    easy for them to hide. This has been speculated on by a number of journalists
                    and other technicians. There were investigations conducted about possibilities
                    that they got some weapons grade material out of the United States. A number of
                    prominent American Jewish leaders' names surfaced during this investigation. I
                    don't think it is useful for me to cite names because I don't have definitive
                    backup to support presumptions in this area, so I will bypass that. The sum and
                    substance of it is that they got the material either from America or from France
                    or from some other source to give them the capability to develop weapons grade
                    material. They have never admitted that they have nuclear weapons. The policy of
                    the Israeli government has been from the very beginning and continues to be
                    enunciated in a statement that goes like this: “The government of Israel will
                    not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into the Middle East.” They have
                    been consistent in that policy all the time. Well, so what? What do I think. I
                    think that they ran a test program with the South Africans in the Indian ocean
                    somewhere, probably in the mid to latter '60s...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>PERNA: Yes, when they detonated a device. This was never confirmed by either
                    government. However, there are means of collecting the bad news about people
                    blowing off big explosions in space, and the collectors got an indication that
                    something went off down there. I surmise that it was a joint Israeli-South
                    African test and I surmise that the Israelis and the South Africans have
                    cooperated closely, possibly in the area of obtaining weapons grade uranium and
                    other source material for making bombs and for making plutonium and the
                    ingredients. I give them credit from a gut feeling of having worked and lived
                    with them of being capable of delivering nuclear weapons by several means. I
                    think they're capable of delivering them by air, I think they're capable of
                    delivering them by rocket, and I think they're capable of delivering them by
                    artillery. This knowhow is not the sole property of the Soviets, the Americans,
                    the British, and the French. The scientific community knows how to do this and I
                    think the Israelis have developed their own capability in these areas. If I had
                    to guess I would say that they have an arsenal that probably numbers in the
                    dozens of nuclear devices. I also think that they are very prudent about the
                    consequences of employing them, and although we used the bomb on Hiroshima and
                    on Nagasaki, it has become apparent to both the Soviets and the Americans during
                    the cold war as well as the British and the French, and the Chinese, that this
                    is a no win policy to start detonating nuclear devices. The consequences are so
                    horrendous to the planet that this is not a good idea. We used nuclear weapons
                    by the thousands to deter the Russians and they used them to deter us, and
                    unfortunately now we are faced with the prospect of the Russian Republics having
                    some thirty thousand plus of these things, under new independent republic
                    governments and we're trying to get treaties engineered with the Soviets to get
                    these things under control. But the Israelis I think realize that it would be as
                    impossible for them to use it as it was for us to use it.</p>

                    when all else had failed and the Arabs were at their throat that they would
                    employ nuclear weapons, in my judgement.</p>

                    Washington, where they sent me on a debriefing tour to go to the major commands
                    and give them a briefing of the Arab-Israeli situation as it stood at the end of
                    '69. I did that in all of the major Army and Air Force Command Headquarters. I
                    then returned to the Pentagon and had a retirement ceremony on the 1st of
                    February 1970.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had decided to retire then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PERNA: Yes. I was assigned in the Pentagon when I got back home in November '69,
                    and I spent December and January touring the major commands, and briefing, and
                    then retired on the 1st of February. That was the end of my military service.
                    Subsequently, I went back to Israel each year and had an opportunity to keep my
                    hand in so to speak on what was going on. I got accredited as a journalist and
                    was given press credentials by the Israelis. I went over 4 or 5 times in the
                    years subsequent to my retirement, and I wrote articles for local newspapers and
                    for some other publications. My last trip was in '85. I haven't been back since
                    '85.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, good. I think we can stop there. Happy retirement,
                        and thank you very much.</hi>
