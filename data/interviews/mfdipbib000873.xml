                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could tell me a bit about your background:
                        when you were born, where you grew up and were educated, and a little about
                        your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Well I'm a Midwesterner. I was born in Iowa in the town of Laurens, in
                    northwest Iowa, Pocahontas County. My father was there as superintendent of
                    schools. He was an educator. But he had been born in Iowa. My mother is also an
                    Iowan. All four of my grandparents came from Norway. Northern Iowa was the part
                    of the world that I grew up in and still know well because I have two brothers
                    who are still in that part of the world. Laurens was a very small, 1,700 person
                    community. I was fortunate in that I had the intellectual influence in my family
                    that comes from having a professional educator father. He attended a little
                    school called Waldorf, in Forest City, Iowa, on successive winters. He farmed
                    during the spring and summer and early fall. He was the only son with six
                    sisters. The sisters, in typical early 20th-century fashion, insisted that he be
                    the one who went to college. So he went to Waldorf, finished high school there,
                    and then went on to Iowa State University, where he got a degree in agricultural
                    education. Henry Wallace was at Iowa State at the time. So my father was not
                    just a farmer; he combined the intellectual and the practical.</p>
                <p>My grandfather on my mother's side was at one time a very wealthy landowner. But
                    he speculated; he borrowed using some farms to buy others, and then lost all but
                    a couple of them. During that heyday, my father bought a farm from him, in
                    northern Iowa, Worth County; we still have that 160-acre farm. We managed to
                    save it. It's still in the family, and I actually own some acres there.</p>
                <p>But the family left Laurens and went to Cedar Falls, Iowa. There was a college
                    there called Iowa State Teachers' College at the time; it's now University of
                    Northern Iowa. My father taught for a couple of years while a professor went on
                    sabbatical. And then he went back to the farm that he had purchased in northern
                    Iowa near Kensett, Iowa. I lived on that farm in northern Iowa for five early
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were born when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>NORLAND: In June of 1924. So from about '26 until '31, we lived on the farm.</p>
                <p>The Depression hit, and my father couldn't make a good living by farming (and by
                    this time there were five of us in the family), so he returned to Laurens to
                    resume his duties as the superintendent of schools. He was very popular, I think
                    it's not unfair to say. So I had eight years, from '31 to '39, living in
                    Laurens.</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact, I went back to the 50th high school reunion although I
                    didn't graduate from there. In '39, things having improved, my father, having
                    done his stint in educating, returned to the farm near Kensett, Iowa. So from
                    '39 to '41, I finished high school in the town of Kensett, named for a painter,
                    John Kensett, I believe. It was a poor school. There were 25 in the graduating
                    class, and it was really an improvised arrangement—a tiny little gymnasium, no
                    football team, all the things that I'd wanted. I graduated from there in
                    1941.</p>
                <p>That fall, what more natural thing to do than to go to the school where my father
                    had taught and my mother had gone to school, Iowa State Teachers' College. So I
                    went to college beginning in September '41. Pearl Harbor was bombed that fall.
                    And in 1943, like so many others (I was 19 and I knew the time was coming) I
                    joined the U.S. Navy. And that began the period of detachment from my roots, you
                    might say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For so many. World War II had such a profound influence on
                        our whole generation, and the generation later, of the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It got us out of the small towns.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: How true! While in Laurens, I had gotten interested in something which
                    one could never dream would play an important role in my life—the sport of
                    football. I became a lineman. (I was big enough then; I weighed about 40 pounds
                    more than I do now.) And when I got into the Navy V-12 program at Northwest
                    Missouri State Teachers's College (Maryville, Missouri), I went out for the
                    football team. In May of 1944, having spent eight months at this pre-midshipman
                    training at Maryville and several months at Asbury Park, N.J., I was sent to
                    Cornell, where I got my ensign's commission in September of '44. And then, in a
                    great bit of luck, I qualified for PT Boats; people thought being a football
                    player gave you a special ability to resist the particular kind of beating you
                    take in PTs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: PT means a small motor boat...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>NORLAND: Patrol torpedo boat. As a matter of fact, this will remind you of what
                    they were like. I brought this...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. We have a picture here of these. If one wants to
                        get a feel for this, a researcher can look at the photo of John F.
                        Kennedy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: That recalls one of the first things that activated my sense of history.
                    I was in the same PT squadron as John F. Kennedy but he had already been to the
                    South Pacific and become something of a hero, and had returned to the training
                    base at Melville, Rhode Island. I met him on a pier at Melville. This is a
                    picture (I'm in the front row there somewhere) of the class I graduated with.
                    He's not there, but I have that picture because it was about that time that I
                    met him. It was an event.</p>
                <p>I played football at Melville. And at the end of the season...I shouldn't say it
                    that way, but we had a base commander who thought that a football team was very
                    important for morale and esprit de corps, so I did not get sent to the Pacific
                    until the football season was over. That was January of '45.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was very, very common, particularly in the Navy. Good
                        boxers, good football teams, these were very, very important.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: For morale. Anyway, this was Commander David I. Walsh III. Since you're
                    from the East, you'll remember that David I. Walsh was the son of a senior
                    senator from Massachusetts. So he had real clout.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: I was sent to the Pacific. After a thirty-day troop transport
                    experience, I arrived in Leyte Gulf in late January 1945. Again, this was four
                    months after the Leyte invasion, but MacArthur's tracks were still evident. And
                    we moved around. Just picking up this folder, I came across a picture of the
                    areas where, in convoy, my squadron, Squadron 7, went from Leyte Gulf around the
                    southern tip of Cebu and to the island of Panay, where I participated in
                    invasions—several, because this was a time of so-called island hopping.
                    MacArthur was the commander in charge. Somewhere I have a picture of MacArthur
                    visiting our PT boat.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Because I was healthy (those Norwegian roots are not unimportant), I ended up at
                    age 20 being in command of a PT boat on several daylight raids, which were
                    considered to be very tricky. Normally one patrolled at night and tried, with
                    radar, to identify barges or other Japanese navy ships. We were trying to draw
                    them out. I was in charge of a PT boat on several raids in Northern Samar
                    Island, just across from Panay if you recall the geography of the Philippines.
                    And so I had several maturing experiences before the age of 21.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: We also conducted night raids, but it happened that I was in command on
                    daylight runs. I can remember being shot at. From a distance, I could see
                    tracers coming toward me. I can't say that I participated in land combat, but
                    that was a very maturing experience.</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact, I was the youngest person on that PT boat. The enlisted
                    personnel all happened to be older. So I matured.</p>
                <p>At the end of the war, I had the experience of being on one of two PT boats
                    selected to go around with a Japanese lieutenant, a Japanese interpreter and an
                    orderly to various smaller islands in the Philippines—Romblon, for example. We
                    would come to a dock, the Japanese officer, the interpreter and an American Army
                    lieutenant would go into the interior of the island with a bullhorn to announce
                    that the war was over. This was September of 1945.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The war had ended in August.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: August 8th, 1945. And that gave me an opportunity, for about a week, to
                    associate with Japanese. The Japanese interpreter, by the way, had been a
                    graduate of Columbia University. He was very intelligent. This experience had
                    the effect of putting the war in perspective, and I've never been terribly
                    troubled since by the fact that the Japanese had shot at me and had caused us a
                    lot of grief at Pearl Harbor. I realized that this was a terrible time and that
                    Japan had an incredibly different civilizational legacy but that it would be
                    overcome by education and leadership.</p>
                <p>I left the PT boats about this time (October 1945) as our PT boat was one of
                    dozens put in mothballs on the Island of Samar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mothballs meaning...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>NORLAND: Being pulled up a river, tied up along with others, stripped of all the
                    armaments, and left to rot. In some cases they were burned, I learned later. But
                    they were kept there provisionally with the idea that they might possibly be
                    used again.</p>
                <p>I was taken off the PT boat and shipped off to minesweeper duty. This can be a
                    long story; I'll shorten it by saying that we went to Guam to pick up the
                    minesweeper—it wasn't there. I rode an aircraft carrier to Okinawa—the
                    minesweeper (AM125) was not there. While in Okinawa in November 1945, Walt
                    McNiff, another fellow who'd been on PTs, and I convinced the Air Force traffic
                    controller that our ship was in Shanghai. We had no evidence on which to base
                    this, but we said to hell with staying in Okinawa for a long period; we wanted
                    to see another part of the world. And we got orders to fly to Shanghai.</p>
                <p>We arrived there on the last day of November 1945. There was no pay station. We
                    were attached to what was called the Glen Line building but were billeted at the
                    Shanghai American School. I know a lot of our China colleagues went to school
                    there. So we settled in to wait, broke but living an extraordinary
                    adventure.</p>
                <p>I became friendly with a Frenchman who had been assistant chief of police in the
                    French quarter. He heard of my plight (and that of my friend), took pity on us
                    and loaned us money. Can you believe it? To me it was phenomenal that a man
                    would loan us money to live. He also took us to his home and fed us. At that
                    point, I took a particular interest in the French language. He had a ten-year
                    old daughter who thought Americans were great. And so I began a study of the
                    French language in earnest.</p>
                <p>To our shock and surprise, however, on about the 2nd of January 1946, our
                    minesweeper arrived. I couldn't believe it. So I became an officer on a
                    minesweeper. We went out of Shanghai, up the Huangpu River to Sasebo, Japan,
                    which was devastated. We were assigned to conduct minesweeping operations in the
                    Tsushima Straits, which we did during February and early March 1946. That was a
                    miserable experience. If you know that part of the world, it's raw weather. It
                    was not fun. But it was interesting.</p>
                <p>Then we were asked to tow a ship back to Guam, and from Guam my ship was returned
                    to Shanghai, in April of '46. Our orders were to turn it over to the Chinese
                    Maritime Customs. As executive officer, my job was to literally count every
                    object on the ship, from silverware to radar, and get a Chinese officer to sign
                    for it. It took two or three months in Shanghai to get that job done.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>During this time, I saw my French friend again and was able to repay him, because
                    instead of turning over goods like flour, rice and sugar (which I knew would not
                    remain on the ship, it would probably be sold on the black market; because I was
                    also a Shore Patrol officer, and I could see things being sold on the streets) I
                    got a truck and took them to my French friend—a hundred pounds of rice, probably
                    an equivalent amount of sugar. He was grateful and it turned out to be an
                    important event in my life.</p>
                <p>Like many other Westerners, he had to leave Shanghai at about that time, because
                    of the threat from the Communists. He went to Nice and bought a small hotel.</p>
                <p>I shipped back to the United States in June of 1946, was demobilized and went to
                    the University of Minnesota. Why? Because one of the people with whom I'd played
                    football at Melville was Bud Svensen, an ex-All American, who talked to Bernie
                    Berman, the coach. Svenson said he had “a young recruit here from Iowa, who
                    seems to be pretty tough, and can help your athletic program.” So I went to the
                    University of Minnesota largely for that reason. I not only played football, I
                    also wrestled. And I stayed at the University of Minnesota from '46 through '48
                    continuously—summer school included, participating in athletics in the fall and
                    winter while working. I was also on the debating team. I was beginning to enjoy
                    it, reveling in this civilian atmosphere. And the mayor of the city was Hubert
                    Humphrey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, later vice president of the United States, a very
                        famous liberal senator, a major political figure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: A major proponent of civil rights, he was the first to develop a city
                    civil rights program. And he was an inspiration to a lot of people, including
                    people who are quite well known today. Max Kampelman, for example, ambassador in
                    charge of arms control, was my second college advisor. The first was a man named
                    Evron Kirkpatrick, who married a woman well known at Georgetown University,
                    Jeane Kirkpatrick.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: So I was in that Minnesota political environment. But I had to work,
                    because a three-year (military) hiatus does not help your intellectual
                    capacity.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I did not serve in World War II; I got the Korean War. But
                        it was a time when everybody was older and more serious. It was a very

                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had to make up for time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: You had that feeling, that you had to move quickly. Instead of the usual
                    fifteen hours, I was taking twenty hours of course work, covering the spectrum.
                    I wasn't sure what I wanted to do.</p>
                <p>After having studied consecutively for two years, i.e. through the summer of '48,
                    I felt I needed a break. My French friend from Shanghai who had returned to
                    France and bought a hotel in Nice, invited me to come over there to stay with
                    him and his family. I was at the stage where I'd gotten a B.A. and I needed a
                    thesis topic, so I thought I would do a thesis on French politics.</p>
                <p>Another Navy friend, well connected in the Greek shipping industry, got me a job
                    as the librarian on a Greek (it was actually a Canadian) tramp steamer. I was to
                    be paid $30 for my services during the trip. I went to New York in June of 1946
                    and caught the steamer. We went to La Guaira, Venezuela, to pick up crude oil,
                    then across the ocean to Martigues, France, where I got off the ship and went to
                    Nice to see my friend.</p>
                <p>I spent from July of '48 through October living in Nice with the family that
                    still felt gratitude for the supplies I gave them at a crucial time. I studied
                    French on my own, using Le Monde, a dictionary and discussions with people. I
                    took a trip around Europe in the course of which I passed through Grenoble,
                    France. When I got back, my friend, whose name was Roger said, “You should
                    really spend more time here. Why not perfect your French? And the best place to
                    do it is Grenoble.” So I arranged to have my GI Bill transferred to
                    Grenoble.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The GI Bill was a government payment of tuition to
                        veterans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: That's right, tuition and a small stipend that was, at that time, enough
                    to live on in France. So from November of '48 through April of '49, I studied at
                    the University of Grenoble. And that was a critical time, because French is
                    important for diplomatic service. I learned French to the point I was
                    comfortable with it. I stayed until April, 1949 and then returned to the
                    University of Minnesota.</p>
                <p>My Master's thesis was entitled “The Politics of the Third Force in France.” At
                    the time, the French were trying to find a middle ground between the Communists,
                    on the one hand, and the Gaullists on the other. There was this attempt to
                    develop a coalition, a middle-of-the-road party. The thesis was a hundred and
                    some pages. This was a big adventure since I had not previously had such a
                    requirement.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>Having finished the thesis, I scouted around for a job. And the first job that
                    appeared was (lo and behold!) an offer to be an instructor at the University of
                    Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls where I had gone to school for two years and where
                    my parents had lived. So I taught political science and history for two years. A
                    great learning experience. Teaching required a wide mastery of your field. I
                    taught what amounted to Constitutional law (I'd had an excellent professor of
                    Constitutional law at Minnesota), and also American History, a course called
                    Contemporary Affairs and comparative governments, because I'd been to France and
                    studied a bit in that part of the world.</p>
                <p>In 1951, after two years, I had to make up my mind whether I was going to get a
                    Ph.D., teach, or whatever. Meanwhile I'd heard about the Foreign Service while
                    in Shanghai, while on shore patrol, I heard about a person called a consul. And
                    I heard that the British were very effective in getting their sailors out of
                    jail, and we were less effective, and it was the effectiveness of the consul
                    that made the difference. I was not able to verify exactly what the British
                    did.</p>
                <p>But I took the exam. It was then a three-day examination.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was actually three and a half days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: That's right. And there was a long language aspect to it.</p>
                <p>Earlier in 1951 I had applied to a number of universities and was accepted at
                    Michigan. So I went to Michigan in the fall and was a teaching assistant there.
                    Met a lot of good people and finished the course work for a Ph.D. I was scouting
                    around for a thesis topic and had chosen diplomatic privileges and immunities,
                    because of this interest in consular work. I was, by this time, pointing in the
                    direction of international affairs as a vocation.</p>
                <p>I passed the written exam in '52 and was invited to Washington to take the oral.
                    I was accepted and sworn into the Foreign Service in July of 1952. As a matter
                    of fact, our class just had its 40th reunion. It was a very good group. John
                    Anderson, the 1980 presidential candidate, was one of our number. One of my
                    classmates took me on a blind date with him in late August or September of 1952,
                    and I met a charming woman who became my wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, tell me a little about the class. How did you and
                        they look at the world and the United States, and how was your training, and
                        how did you look upon a career at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Well, that's interesting, because we did spend a certain amount of time,
                    in the course of our reunion, on the training. And I can tell you that we had
                    our biggest laughs when we looked over the syllabus for our training course. It
                    was largely theory. There was a lot of protocol, a lot about the social
                    behavior, which you can imagine was very different.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It played such a small role in our business.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Now it seems to play an even smaller role. For example, one of the major
                    subjects which we discussed in 1952 was linguistics and language. We had a man,
                    and I think his name was Henry Lee Smith...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Huxie Smith.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: He would listen to you talk for a few minutes and then tell you where
                    you were from, your linguistic influences. Do you remember him?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, oh, yes. Fascinating.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: It was fascinating indeed. We also had lectures about the role of the
                    United States in the world.</p>
                <p>We didn't do much on the specifics of international organization or international
                    law, something I was interested in. We didn't focus on administration. We didn't
                    practice writing requirements as they do today. And we didn't “bond” in the way
                    that they now do. Young officers spend a lot of time in retreats “bonding.” We
                    got along very well. Only a couple of us were married with the special schedule
                    that entails.</p>
                <p>We were certainly aware of the fact that the United States played a key role in
                    the world. And we were all anxious to join in the anti-Communist struggle. I
                    don't think there was anyone who didn't realize this was a very serious
                    undertaking, that we were going to be spending a great deal of time fashioning
                    ways of countering Communist influence.</p>
                <p>For example, we traveled to New York, and the person who briefed us there was
                    Bertram Wolfe. Bertram Wolfe had been a Communist who'd gone to Mexico, written
                    about Communism, was a friend of Diego Rivera, who was a Communist. Wolfe then
                    escaped the Communist clutches and wrote a book called “Three Who Made a
                    Revolution.” It was a classic. I had read the book but to be briefed by Bertram
                    Wolfe was an experience. He was actually a very unassuming guy, unmistakably
                    anti-Communist, and doing everything he could to counter it. I think he was a
                    consultant for the VOA at the time. He was certainly a source of motivation.</p>
                <p>Another phenomenon of that time really bothered us, namely McCarthyism.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain? After all, here you were, I assume
                        practically all of you were military veterans. Your patriotism was not up
                        for question or anything else. You weren't artsy fartsy college liberals or
                        something like that. And then, to have this thing descend on the Foreign
                        Service. And brand-new. How did this react on you all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: I looked upon it as a real challenge. I defied the McCarthyist idea. I
                    had done so while teaching, by the way; I had given college lectures, to the
                    point that I antagonized a lot of people, saying that McCarthy was a fraud. And
                    when I got into the Foreign Service (luckily I suppose), I didn't change my
                    thinking that he was a menace. I couldn't understand why the American public was
                    so slow to react. There was a momentum that was sweeping away even the General
                    Eisenhowers of the world. Remember, he refused to defend General Marshall
                    publicly. It was a terrible thing, and we talked about this, and we worried
                    about the influence this would have. It was eroding morale. There were people
                    who were being hurt. And people who were taking positions of responsibility,
                    like Scott McLeod, were known henchmen. (He was in charge of security.) So it
                    was a time of great concern.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting the feeling, gee, you better watch out
                        what you report? How was this affecting you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: I would not say that we were affected in that way. There was a kind of
                    underlying defiance, a feeling that this man McCarthy and his ideas could not
                    prevail, because there was no substance to it. And I know, privately, we were
                    absolutely convinced this could not last. But how you go about combating it—only
                    in little ways. We probably wrote letters, maybe even a petition, to get people
                    to stand up more strongly. No one can remember what we actually did but I had
                    the feeling that it was terribly wrong. We were, as you say, mature people and
                    veterans. I think the average age of the class was 29 or 30; I was 28.</p>
                <p>And, worse, my first assignment was Morocco. To pursue this McCarthy business, my
                    first duties were as assistant public affairs officer. The public affairs
                    officer soon left, and while I was in charge the team of Cohn and Schine made a
                    trip to Europe and threatened to come to Morocco. I got a telegram saying that,
                    in anticipation of their visit, I should remove from the shelves of the library
                    all books by Dashiell Hammett, the murder mystery writer, and a couple of other
                    names.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Right. It was unbelievable—in America.</p>

                <p>NORLAND: Indeed.</p>
                <p>

                        around. I hate to use the term, but they were just absolutely animals, being
                        unintellectual and having a wonderful time giving a terrible name to the
                        United States. They were so-called “investigating” books, and they would run
                        around ripping books off shelves.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: That's right. And it had further personal consequence in that I was
                    scheduled for home leave after two years. I had arrived in Morocco in December
                    of 1952. 1954 came, and the Department decided not to give us home leave, for
                    fear that, once we returned to Washington our positions would be abolished and
                    there would be an opportunity for the McCarthyists to talk to us, to conduct
                    investigations. I mean, I don't know what all was feared. But it was a
                    ridiculous episode.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's go back to the time you were there. I came in
                        in 1955, and I had very much the impression, as I think most of my class
                        did, that you really couldn't trust the Secretary of State. Alger Hiss and
                        that whole case. I had no doubt about his guilt, as leaking documents to
                        the...I got the feeling that my superiors would not back me up. One had the
                        feeling that Dean Acheson was a solid person, but that Dulles was not, as
                        far as standing up for the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: That is certainly true. And I developed a dislike of Dulles even before
                    I saw him. I saw him a couple of times and actually had dealings once. But
                    Dulles could subordinate what I thought was his natural human and democratic
                    instinct and bow down to this man McCarthy. And when Dulles succeeded in getting
                    rid of a number of people and letting the security people have their way,
                    obviously acquiescing in a number of things that McCarthy was doing, it made
                    things worse. I mean, it was not a good time to be in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did this not turn anybody off?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Oh, yes, I think it did. I don't think any of our group actually
                    resigned as a result of it, but they certainly developed an active dislike for
                    that particular era and that particular regime. I don't know anyone who looks
                    back fondly at John Foster Dulles's term as Secretary of State. I did return to
                    the Department and was working there while he was going around developing the
                    SEATOs and the CENTOs, these anti-Communist alliances, and calling nonalignment
                    immoral. And that showed that he was catering to influences that were not well
                    grounded in reality, and that he didn't understand the non-industrialized
                    world.</p>

                        where you served from '52 to '56.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: That's right. I was supposed to come home on home leave in '54, but they
                    were afraid, so I stayed on and on, and finally left in January of '56, having
                    spent more than three years at my first post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Morocco when you went there in
                        '52?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: This was a fascinating period. Let me give you a quick overview of the
                    '52 to '60 period. In the course of those years, I spent five years abroad under
                    colonial regimes. The only way to understand what was going on in Morocco at
                    that time, and what was going on in Ivory Coast later, was to see that the
                    colonial power was determined to retain its status and maintain its citizens in
                    positions of power and responsibility. It was another mentality. And we're only
                    talking forty years ago. But in Morocco the atmosphere was dominated by the
                    French, in the person of the French resident general sitting in the highest
                    position of authority, with the Moroccan monarchy reduced considerably in
                    stature by the way the French treated him, King Mohammed V. (He was then known
                    as Sultan Mohammed V.)</p>
                <p>At that same time, there was percolating in the body politic of Morocco the
                    effects of what an American president had done in 1942. You remember President
                    Roosevelt had met with the Sultan after the Casablanca Conference. He told the
                    Sultan that he would do nothing to facilitate continued French colonialism in
                    the world. And that applied specifically to Morocco.</p>
                <p>Roosevelt's word had given rise to feelings of independence, which were focused
                    in the Independence Movement (in Arabic the word is Istiqlal). Istiqlal was
                    banned by the French, it was anathema to the authorities and, of course, it was
                    gaining ground rapidly among Moroccans.</p>
                <p>So you had this implacable confrontation between the French on the one hand, with
                    their extraordinary armed forces...I became quite well acquainted with G�n�ral
                    Duval, who was the head of those armed forces for much of the time that I was
                    there...and the Moroccan people. The French armed forces controlled the city,
                    patrolling where necessary. They had spies; they had their ways of exercising
                    authority. And on the other hand, you had the Moroccans, who were quietly going
                    about in their djellabas (long gowns).</p>
                <p>The djellaba, in a sense, was a metaphor for their politics—a deceptively common
                    outer garment able to conceal arms while they looked you in the eye and said,
                    “I'm not doing anything wrong, I'm just trying to stay out of trouble,” then
                    going behind the scenes and conducting what we today call terrorist attacks.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>One of my jobs, when I moved to the political section of the embassy, was to send
                    in weekly reports of the number of arson cases, terrorist attacks, armed
                    incidents, such as assaults on French authority by Moroccans.</p>
                <p>My boss there, by the way, was a figure of great capacity and dimensions. I'm
                    sure you've heard his name—Bill Porter. I'm terribly sorry he did not get his
                    chance to do an oral history. Bill Porter was a man who understood the Moroccan
                    mentality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: He became the consul general in the fall of '53. John Dorman had been
                    the consul.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In those days, we didn't have an ambassador because it
                        wasn't...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: It was not independent. We had a minister resident in Tangier. And those
                    ministers were extraordinarily competent people. John Carter Vincent was one.
                    And Joe Satterthwaite. And the reason those ministers were there was because
                    they did not require Senate confirmation. John Carter Vincent was suspect
                    because of his China policies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about the McCarthy period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Yes, he was minister during the McCarthy period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this is where you kind of...I won't say buried them,
                        but kept them out of the line of fire.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: That's true. And the ministers had very little to say about what we were
                    doing in French Morocco.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Rabat, wasn't the system that Morocco was considered a
                        separate country?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>NORLAND: Indeed it was. It was governed under the terms of the Treaty of F�s,
                    which was agreed between Marshal Lyautey and the Moroccans in 1912. In a word,
                    it provided that Morocco would be autonomous, except for defense and foreign
                    affairs, which would be in the hands of the French. And, of course, the French
                    expanded the authority granted them in that loophole (defense and foreign
                    affairs), and literally ran the country. Their investments were the dynamism
                    that enabled the country to be actually quite prosperous and economically
                    interesting. The Moroccans have great tourist potential. One olive oil company,
                    Huile Lesieur, for example, in Casablanca, was a major multinational, we would
                    say today. But the French used Morocco as a kind of training ground for their
                    military. And they were constantly trying to preempt prominent Moroccans and get
                    them to front for their administration.</p>
                <p>I was going to say, when Bill Porter and I would drive inland, to F�s, for
                    example, we had to go through roadblocks. And roadblocks meant French military
                    poking their guns inside the windows of the car until you showed them your
                    papers, and then you'd go on. It was a case of strict military domination and
                    not pretty.</p>
                <p>Bill handled it very well. He got to know the successive residents general. There
                    was Guillaume, Duval, Dubois, a former prefect of police in Paris, very
                    prominent French politicians in positions of authority. But the Moroccans made
                    their wishes known.</p>
                <p>Let me offer one incident that will describe what it was like to live in that
                    country. I was the lowest-ranking officer in the consulate general. Bill Porter,
                    having spent a lot of time in the Middle East (his first post was Baghdad about
                    '36; he went on to Lebanon and Cairo), understood the mentalities, studied
                    Arabic, and knew that the future of the country was with the Moroccan
                    independence movement. And we kept getting informal emissaries from King
                    Mohammed V.</p>
                <p>One man, named Sbihi, was one of these quiet Moroccans who would slip in the back
                    door to talk, in anxious tones, to Bill Porter, leaning forward, telling him all
                    the feelings at the palace, how the king wanted help, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be Mohammed V.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Mohammed V. We'll call him the king from now on because that's when he
                    changed his name.</p>
                <p>The king wanted to cause the Americans to understand that the independence
                    movement would be friendly to us, that Moroccans were not anti-French, but this
                    was the age of independence. They remembered what Roosevelt had said.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>Bill Porter would play the game absolutely straight and say, “Thank you very
                    much. We know we are indeed a symbol of independence, of course. But at the
                    moment, the French are the authority here, and we must work and try to negotiate
                    something different.”</p>
                <p>At one point, a young Moroccan named Douiri came to my house. He'd been educated
                    in France at the �cole des Mines. He'd returned and he was the top-ranking
                    working-level Moroccan official. (He's still a figure in Moroccan politics,
                    although I'm told he's not well.) He came to me and he asked to talk. I reported
                    this to Bill Porter, who somehow got the Department to agree to allow me to have
                    a contact with this young Moroccan. It took about two meetings to determine
                    that, instead of being what the French thought he was, namely a product of the
                    French universities and someone who believed entirely in the French way of
                    looking at things, Douiri was a member of Istiqlal. I then had an authorized
                    contact with a member of Istiqlal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just a bit about how we operated. Here we were, our oldest
                        relationship with any country in the world was with Morocco, of all things.
                        The French dominated it, but at the same time, legally, the situation wasn't
                        quite that straightforward. You had this independent movement going on. How
                        were you guided as far as contacts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Well, we were passive; I never put out the word that I wanted to see
                    Douiri. I was authorized to receive him in my house when he came around. So it
                    was usually after dark, in the most imperceptible way, that he would somehow
                    find his way to the house.</p>
                <p>I should have mentioned, as part of this overall contact, something which I
                    stress very much when I lecture on the subject. That is the fact that the United
                    States was building five major air bases in Morocco at this time, three of which
                    were already operational. And you know their purpose. Perhaps I should put it on
                    the record: these were so-called recovery bases for American aircraft striking
                    the USSR from bases in the Middle East...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the Soviet Union.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: A strike against the Soviet Union. They would make their strike,
                    possibly from the United States, and would stop in Morocco for refueling and
                    recovery, as they say.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>And so this was a country that was playing an important role in the thinking of
                    our Strategic Air Command, which was operating the bases. Morocco became
                    important. The U.S. talked in the same terms about Libya and Wheelus Air Force
                    Base, the Azores, about other bases around the world. But because of this
                    strategic measure we were doing everything possible to m�nager (spare) the
                    French, i.e. to be very careful about maintaining good relations with the
                    French. They were an ally in NATO—not totally committed to NATO, but they were
                    our ally, and we had this common adversary. And that superseded all other
                    considerations in our relationship with the Moroccans; we treated the latter
                    accordingly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, back to this contact with the young official
                        of the Ministry of Mines.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Right. He would come around, and he would pass information about what
                    the Istiqlal was doing, how they were organizing, mobilizing. They even began a
                    newspaper at this time. We were trying to find out whether there was Communist
                    influence in Istiqlal. And there were, of course, some members who were
                    Communists, but we were convinced that they were not dominant in the movement.
                    So we maintained this contact.</p>
                <p>I have to say that, later on, I discovered that our CIA representatives, who were
                    based in Tangier, were receiving Istiqlal and other nationalist leaders, without
                    the same inhibitions because it was the so-called international city. The
                    Moroccans who got to Tangier felt much more open about seeing our people,
                    although I'm sure the French knew who they were and who was being received.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever worry about the French sending agents
                        provocateur to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Oh, yes. And the French occasionally would seek Bill Porter and ask:
                    “Why are you receiving these Moroccans?”</p>
                <p>And he would reply, “We don't turn people away if they come to our door. We can't
                    turn them away, but we do not receive them in their capacity as independence
                    movement leaders. We are an open country, an open mission, and we receive
                    anybody. Send over your people.”</p>
                <p>He was very good at this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When talking to this young Moroccan man, were you trying
                        to extract information without giving encouragement?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>NORLAND: That's right, that certainly describes it. It was to show that we were
                    open, and not renouncing our past. We recognized that our country had produced
                    the Declaration of Independence (which they kept reminding us), and that it was
                    contrary to our historical tradition to oppose independence. But I can remember
                    saying, time and again, “Look, we're in an international confrontation here, and
                    once this is over, who can say.” Meanwhile, our instructions were to do
                    everything possible to cultivate the French.</p>
                <p>And, incidentally, in running the American Library in Rabat, which I did for a
                    year, we were discouraged from having Moroccans come into the center. We
                    oriented our programs almost exclusively to the French.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Because if we brought in Moroccans we could be accused of tainting them
                    with the ideals of independence. I know the French used to plant people inside
                    the door and take note of which Moroccans would visit the Library. We were
                    running a book-lending operation, for example, movies, art exhibits; the
                    invitations went almost exclusively to the French and to those very few
                    Moroccans who were considered to be approved, like the one that I was seeing,
                    Mohammed Douiri.</p>
                <p>Can you imagine having an information operation in a country of about twelve
                    million, with only perhaps a couple of hundred thousand French, and yet the
                    whole operation geared to the French?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this causing discomfort with you and with others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Sure, but orders are orders.</p>
                <p>I can remember one exhibit, for example. I had some people who were quite good at
                    putting things together. We were trying to convey to the Moroccans, as well as
                    to the French, what our policy was, and so we called one exhibit La Pieuvre
                    Rouge (pieuvre is octopus, in French).</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Red Octopus.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>NORLAND: We had all kinds of tentacles going out, including USSR tentacles,
                    toward Morocco (we were trying to justify our important base operation). This
                    was an attempt to educate both the Moroccans and the French. To the Moroccans,
                    we were saying, “Look, there is a greater danger even than your French colonial
                    master.” And to the French, we were saying, “Look, you can trust us. We
                    understand the global threat, and we're going to continue the policy as long as
                    this danger persists.”</p>
                <p>It was something, all the military resources in the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you moved from the USIS.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: To the consulate general, where I became the political officer. Jack
                    Bowie left, because he didn't get along with Bill Porter. And I was asked to
                    move. We liked Bill and Eleanore very much. It was great to work for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a political reporter, you say you were counting up
                        terrorist incidents and all, but were there any official Moroccans you could
                        talk to openly, or weren't you able to go to the palace?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: No. The palace was guarded very carefully. Bill Porter, the consul
                    general, would go there on ceremonial occasions, but little business was
                    transacted. I don't think, except for special occasions, he was allowed to see
                    the king. It was very much a resident-general-oriented operation.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, the resident general always had a Moroccan aide-de-camp, a military
                    aide. That was very good for photo ops., as we would say today, because it
                    looked as though some Moroccans were supporting the French presence. There were
                    Moroccan soldiers totally integrated into the French military—very good
                    soldiers, always well trained and groomed; they also had cavalry (horse)
                    divisions. There was one particular aide-de-camp, assistant to the resident
                    general, who seemed always to be around. The French would present him proudly.
                    Colonel Oufkir would meet Bill when he got out of his car, walk him up the red
                    carpet, sit in the Resident General's meetings, and escort him back to his car.
                    To make a long story short, it turned out that Oufkir told Bill Porter of his
                    sympathies for the independence movement. So, during the years where the French
                    thought they were showing off Moroccans loyal to the French, in fact, their
                    “model” turned out to be a strong independence supporter. I've never seen this
                    in print but I'm confident it's true.</p>
                <p>Oufkir became suspect in later years...as detailed in a book that came out last
                    year, called “Notre Ami le Roi” (Our Friend the King), by a French investigative
                    reporter who documents the fact that Colonel Oufkir was among those trying to
                    overthrow the king at Fedala, site of the king's house south of Rabat, during a
                    major celebration.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: That's right, Colonel Oufkir was one of the key people in that whole
                    episode, and was himself killed. One of the things that this book, “Notre Ami le
                    Roi,” goes into in great detail is that Colonel Oufkir's wife and several
                    children, including a five-month-old child, were held in jail without bail,
                    without hearing, without any judicial process, until about a year ago
                    (1991).</p>

                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: It's an example of the arbitrariness of the king. And I don't think you
                    can read this book, or two or three others that have come out as well, without
                    concluding that King Hassan, the son of Mohammed V, is guilty of gross
                    violations of human rights. The comparison made a year ago was with Saddam
                    Hussein.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: True.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Among the French that you'd meet, was there disquiet about
                        the future of French dominance there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>NORLAND: It's part of the posturing that goes on in these countries always. If
                    you show the slightest crack in your psychological armor, even admitting the
                    possibility that there might be change in the future...the French might agree
                    but would respond, “Eventually, perhaps, sometime down the road.” But the
                    thought of a break soon—such as occurred in Morocco in 1955—came as a shock. It
                    came when Pierre Mend�s-France became prime minister of France and decided that
                    resistance to change was not useful.</p>
                <p>There was the difficult problem of the colons, the farmer-colonizers. There were
                    organizations of colons who would simply not countenance the thought that
                    Morocco would not forever be the way it was, that they would be forced to leave
                    their beautiful homes and their easy situations, with servants and cheap labor
                    responding to their beck and call, as they had always done. We knew people among
                    the French (unfortunately, those were the people that we socialized with) who
                    had the swimming pools, the parties; and Moroccans were wonderful as domestic
                    servants, very good at many different tasks.</p>
                <p>So there was no apparent concession of any significance among the French that I
                    knew. I knew a number of people. I was an official of the Franco-American Club,
                    for example, where I helped bring together French and Americans—the Americans to
                    learn French. We produced tourist outings, lectures. We'd give French officials
                    a chance to explain their policies. Moroccans never attended those meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there during the changeover?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe how it developed. You might also talk
                        about our response and the feeling of our reporting, how we saw this. Or was
                        this something that basically happened in France. And then how did it work
                        out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: As far as our operation in Rabat was concerned, we were on the
                    defensive, in the sense that we could not produce these earthshaking changes. We
                    were simply reporting. We had little influence on events. It was the Moroccans
                    who were creating the conditions that became insupportable. They accelerated
                    terrorist activities. They began demonstrations, which we would report. They
                    were usually under some euphemistic heading, not independence, but for higher
                    wages, for example, or against something the French had done. They would make
                    their wishes known in various ways. But it was the French in France, the Pierre
                    M�ndes-France types, who had concluded that this was simply untenable or
                    affordable and France would have to do something. And they then had to decide
                    with whom they were going to negotiate.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Do you remember the sequence of events, by the way?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not in detail.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: In August of 1953, the French found the presence of King Mohammed V in
                    Morocco uncontrollable. So one very dark night (I think it was the 18th of
                    August 1953), they removed him from the palace and took him by plane to
                    Madagascar, Antsirabe, if you know Madagascar. [There are three Antsirabes in
                    Madagascar.] There he was kept until 1955, about the 25th of November. In the
                    interim, the French brought in a minor religious leader named Ben Arafa, from
                    F�s, a man who could scarcely speak. (I guess his Arabic was good, but he didn't
                    speak French.) They made a puppet king of him. As you know, the king of Morocco
                    is also a spiritual leader. The principal sects regard the king of Morocco as
                    the descendant of Mohammed and, as a result, pay religious as well as political
                    allegiance to the king. Ben Arafa was able to claim some of that authority. But
                    he was still a puppet, and everybody knew it. So there were a succession of
                    anti-Arafa demonstrations. They were publicly pro Mohammed V, of course, but
                    everybody knew that in fact they were calling for the sultan's return. The
                    sultan's return then became the loudest rallying outcry, when Moroccans talked
                    politics.</p>
                <p>But, it was what was going on in France that created the change.</p>
                <p>I'm sure that the French in Morocco were reporting that the situation had become
                    increasingly difficult because there were some extraordinary events.</p>
                <p>For example, the large demonstrations. On occasions when the French were trying
                    to put on a good show, the Moroccans would refuse to show; they would boycott an
                    event. And it became apparent that the event couldn't take place.</p>
                <p>And various things occurred that could have had significant implications. I don't
                    know if they did or not. But I go back to the commanding general, General Duval,
                    a four-star French general, a man who had a gimpy leg. At the time, I was
                    playing quite a lot of tennis, and he saw me at one point and asked me to become
                    his regular tennis partner. This was morning tennis, after which we would have
                    orange juice, coffee, and croissants at a little cabana right next to the court.
                    The general and I got to be quite well acquainted.</p>
                <p>But one day he asked me if I would like to go with him on a flight into the
                    interior, to show me, as a political officer at the consulate, how his troops
                    were combating a dissident movement in the interior.</p>
                <p>I asked Bill Porter, “What do you think?”</p>
                <p>And he said, “Well, you know, it's up to you.”</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>I had just become a father for the first time, and I thought, no, I guess I
                    better not.</p>
                <p>Duval went out that day, his plane crashed, and he was killed. Nobody knows
                    whether his plane was shot down or whether he actually lost control.
                    Whatever.</p>
                <p>But the fact that they lost a four-star general was an event. It had a certain
                    psychological impact on what was going on.</p>
                <p>So there were incidents like that, combined with the sullenness of Moroccans in
                    public demonstrations, that were obviously pointing the way.</p>
                <p>You may have heard of the leader in Marrakech called El-Glaoui. Glaoui was from
                    another age, really. He was “old fashioned” but it's worse than that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hadn't he been around since the turn of the century, or
                        something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, he was the longest...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Pasha.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pasha. We're talking about well before World War I.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: He was, at one point, kind of a nationalist. But the French got him and
                    tried to bargain, using El-Glaoui's authority to try to get acceptance for what
                    was going on in Rabat. And that just didn't work at all; it was a futile
                    exercise.</p>
                <p>But what's so hard for people to understand (it relates to one of your first
                    questions) is the determination of the French people, the fact that they did
                    have an effective army and military control. Yet if it had been just a matter of
                    military resources, a military confrontation, the French could have hung on. But
                    there was something else, as we later learned in Vietnam, that made it untenable
                    and so disrupted the relationship that they could never have been comfortable
                    staying in the country if they continued to resist in the way that they did.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>So they made concessions. And in November of 1955, I remember standing on the
                    road leading from the airport at Sal� where the Bou Regreg River runs in the
                    valley, with the king coming by on his return and hundreds of thousands of
                    people lining both sides of the road as he drove back up to the palace. After
                    that it was just a matter of formalities before he was totally reinstated and
                    independence declared in March of 1956.</p>
                <p>It was an interesting story.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: No. In January of '56, I got orders to return to this country and
                    assigned to the Moroccan-Tunisian Desk as the first desk officer for those two
                    countries.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: The same month, right. I actually greeted the first representatives of
                    Morocco and Tunisia, at the 21st Street entrance of “New State”. In the case of
                    Tunisia, it was Habib Bourguiba, Jr. In the case of Morocco, it was Dr. Ahmed
                    Ben Aboud, who's still a friend.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did the Moroccan-Tunisian Desk fit in Near Eastern
                        Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: That's exactly what it was. There was no African Bureau at the time. It
                    was under the Office of North African Affairs, which, incidentally, was, at the
                    time, directed by Leo Cyr, with Fred Hadsel as the number two. But Bill Porter
                    came back to take over that desk in 1957. After being the first charge in Rabat,
                    he returned to the Department. So I worked for him another two years, five years
                    in all.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was your first time working in Washington. What did
                        you feel was the role of the Moroccan-Tunisian Desk? Here are two
                        independent states, and sandwiched between them was Algeria. This was the
                        period of the great Algerian war in the Department of State—the French Desk
                        and the NATO people. France was absolutely key. And yet here you were, and
                        Algeria was part of France. Anyway, could you describe how you saw this
                        played out at the bureaucratic level?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>NORLAND: As usual, there are several levels in the bureaucracy. Just to give you
                    a quick illustration: the governments of Morocco and Tunisia looked upon our
                    recognition as a tremendous event and expected a great deal of us. They wanted
                    technical assistance; they wanted a flood of student exchanges; they wanted to
                    enhance their status. They competed actively to get us to attend embassy
                    functions. So, on the one hand, we were being courted; on the other hand, they
                    were trying to promote the Algerian cause. And they were telling us, for
                    example, you should receive Ferhat Abbas (an Algerian nationalist). You should
                    receive some of the other leaders (whose faces I can see and who I met at the
                    time).</p>
                <p>But, of course, we were reminded daily by the French Desk that Algeria was part
                    of France (even though the rebellion had broken out in 1954), and we were not to
                    mess around. Every time the Tunisians and the Moroccans wanted us to receive one
                    of these Algerian leaders (there were some very distinguished people). I
                    mentioned Ferhat Abbas, a pharmacist, and very moderate; there was another man,
                    who was their regular emissary here, whose name I will come to). We could hardly
                    get the French Desk to agree to let us see them. And the relationship with the
                    French Desk often became tense. Some people on the French Desk were totally
                    Francophile and saw these Third World liberation movements as nothing but an
                    invitation to chaos. And you still have something of that division in the
                    Foreign Service, if people honestly level with you. So the tensions were
                    real.</p>
                <p>Still, this didn't prevent us from doing everything we could for the Moroccans
                    and Tunisians. And although there was much to be done, we didn't have the
                    resources. We were not responding to the extent that both those countries
                    hoped.</p>
                <p>We did, however, succeed in doing one of the first things they wanted, which was
                    to have official visits by their respective chiefs of state.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As far as assistance, which was not as highly developed as
                        it became later on, particularly in the Kennedy and Johnson and Nixon
                        administrations, did we consider that in these two places, France could do
                        its aid and assistance there, and we would concentrate elsewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Well, we had no basis or experience for undertaking programs of real
                    scope in those countries. The French controlled the economies of both.</p>
                <p>And there was a time in both countries when the French gave every indication of
                    being able to reconcile their economic interests and the new independent
                    governments. There were a number of intransigent colons (French colonists) who
                    returned to France, but a surprising number stayed.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>In the case of Morocco, King Mohammed V was very benevolent, very understanding.
                    He was not a firebrand. He was quiet, possibly because he was not well and
                    physically fragile. I remember shaking his hand a few times; it was a limp
                    handshake. And yet he had tremendous stature.</p>
                <p>So the French were not making a mad rush for the exits.</p>
                <p>And what did we know that would qualify us to move in? What did we know about
                    Morocco or Tunisia? Morocco was one of the first countries to recognize our
                    independence. Actually they did so two weeks after France. We had a long
                    history—but virtually no American presence in Morocco. We had a legation at
                    Tangier, and a few investors. We had some American expatriates, like Paul Bowles
                    and Truman Capote. But we had almost nothing in the way of real presence. I
                    don't think we had a significant number of missionaries. The French had
                    virtually dominated the country. So independence was largely ceremonial. And
                    that's why the State visits were key.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the visits go? I assume you got involved very much
                        in them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: It was in October of 1957 that the king of Morocco came. By that time,
                    we'd divided the office, so that there was a Tunisian Desk officer (Arthur
                    Allen, who I think died). I was doing Morocco. The king came in October of '57.
                    In those days, the U.S. president went to the airport, National Airport, to
                    greet high-ranking visitors. As Desk officer I had been preparing a number of
                    briefing papers. One very lengthy paper (drafted by the Historical Division)
                    focused on the question of whether Morocco was the first country to recognize
                    American independence. I was all prepared for a variety of questions as there
                    was a certain amount of press interest.</p>
                <p>President Eisenhower did go to the airport as scheduled. And waiting there beside
                    the President, was John Foster Dulles; the chairman of the joint chiefs; several
                    others from State, plus Bill Porter. And way down at the end, was I. Wiley
                    Buchanan was in charge of protocol. About ten minutes before the King's arrival,
                    Wiley Buchanan came walking down this line of people, accompanied by Bill
                    Porter, to where I was standing, and asked me to “come up here”. The President
                    was asking whether Morocco was the first country to recognize the United States
                    or not. I walked up, with Bill Porter, and I stood there with the President and
                    Dulles. And the President turned to me and said, in a very businesslike way,
                    “Was Morocco the first country to recognize us?”</p>
                <p>The answer was: “No sir, on August 15th of 1778, the French recognized us. Two
                    weeks later, the Moroccans saluted one of our ships.”</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>He asked me another question or two about what the relationship was of this
                    particular king and the United States, and what we had been doing for Morocco,
                    and so forth. Ike turned to Dulles and said, “Well, we can't say that they were
                    the first, then.”</p>
                <p>Dulles agreed, “No, we can't.”</p>
                <p>I stood in that company for a few minutes before returning to the end of the
                    line.</p>
                <p>That was about 12:30. The ceremony was over. Then Eisenhower went back to his
                    quarters and had a heart attack.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, my God.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: To fill in at the first official dinner was Vice President Richard Nixon
                    and I was asked to help interpret. At the official dinner, which was at the
                    Mayflower Hotel, I remember the king, who did not bring any female with him, and
                    Vice President Nixon, and Prince Moulay Abdullah. Prince Hassan stayed in
                    Morocco. My task was to sit behind Mrs. Nixon and Prince Abdullah as
                    interpreter—French to English. So I had an upfront perspective on events, and
                    saw Mrs. Nixon in action with this prince. He was a ne'er-do-well, who had
                    brought over several French ladies to accompany him, and didn't pay attention,
                    wasn't interested in what Mrs. Nixon was saying, and, as a matter of fact, made
                    some offhand cracks to me, which it would have been improper to translate.</p>
                <p>There was a subsequent luncheon given at Anderson House, on Massachusetts Avenue.
                    J. Edgar Hoover attended; it was hosted by Vice President Nixon. Those two
                    talked very animatedly. I remember overhearing a little of their
                    conversation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: J. Edgar Hoover was the head of the FBI and a very strong
                        conservative, a very difficult man.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Yes. So the visit was disrupted—the flow, the level. They didn't have
                    the big dinner at the White House. And, of course, people were very concerned
                    about the President's health which was the subject, as I recall, of the
                    Hoover-Nixon conversation.</p>
                <p>It was an interesting visit. The Moroccans never showed their dissatisfaction
                    with events. They're too polite. I still have two autographed pictures from King
                    Mohammed V of Morocco—they forgot they'd given me one, and they gave me another
                    as a souvenir of the visit.</p>
                <p>But then the king died in 1960; he had not been well, and King Hassan took
                    over.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Bourguiba come to the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Yes, Bourguiba also came to the United States. He was dynamic. I did not
                    get as deeply involved in that visit. I didn't attend the major dinner, although
                    I did attend the reception and had a chance to talk to him. And his son became a
                    friend. Bourguiba's son had a boy who was the same age as my eldest son, and we
                    actually shared babysitters at one point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was ambassador to the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: He became ambassador. He was first minister; Mongi Slim was the
                    ambassador. But he was the first person to come to the U.S. and prepare the way.
                    And he was an awfully nice person, as you know—and competent. Married to the
                    daughter of the interior minister of Tunisia, and very well placed. He'd come
                    with his family to share a snack at the house and bring his son over there, and
                    they played together. We later saw Habib, Jr. when he became ambassador to
                    Italy. He went through a period where he was not well. But Habib, Sr. didn't
                    speak English, and so a lot of his charm was lost in translation.</p>
                <p>But there were distractions even in those days that kept President Bourguiba's
                    visit from becoming the major event that the Tunisians would have wanted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much, particularly since you were dealing mainly with
                        Morocco on the Desk, did the air base and the navy base that we had there
                        continue to dominate our policy during that period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: They were very important. As long as Mohammed V was alive, it seems to
                    me, the pressures on us to leave weren't great. I left the Desk in the fall of
                    '58, having done almost three years, but I have to say that as of the time that
                    I was still on the Desk, Mohammed V was still around, and there were
                    indications, but I don't think anything more than that, that we would be asked
                    to leave. And we were doing everything possible to conduct a rearguard action
                    that would enable us to stay.</p>
                <p>I think by the end of the Fifties, the king had also come under tremendous
                    pressure from Istiqlal that led him to conclude that we would have to leave our
                    bases. And I'm sure that it was in that period that the king said, “Prepare to
                    leave.”</p>
                <p>Then we had negotiations that resulted, for example, in one of the bases,
                    Nouasser, outside Casablanca, being turned into an international airport. The
                    one near Marrakech, Ben Guerir, was closed. The same for the base near Mekn�s.
                    Two of the bases were never operational. They became a source of acrimony,
                    needless to say. Our military were not very pleased.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this, of course, is always one of the problems. Once
                        we're in, the State Department finds itself in the not-very-pleasant
                        position of trying to protect our military interests in the place, while at
                        the same time trying to curb our military which wants to really sort of take
                        over. Around the area, our people don't come under Moroccan law, and there's
                        always the unhappiness and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Status of Forces agreement was one of the major problems that we had
                    with the Moroccans. When our people committed criminal acts, e.g., violence to
                    Moroccans such as automobile accidents, it did not go over well that we were
                    able to extract those people from Moroccan jurisdictions. That probably
                    contributed significantly to the Moroccan decision to ask us to leave. I leave
                    it to others to assess to what extent that was done entirely amicably, or
                    whether there were some residual problems that have impaired our relations ever
                    since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the October '56 war, which we know as the Suez
                        crisis? How did that impact? I guess at that time you were dealing with both
                        in Tunisia and in Morocco.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: I know that we were deeply concerned that there would be events in both
                    countries that would be inimical to our interests. As I recall, there was no
                    overt anti-American activity. I'd be surprised if the record shows that there
                    were even significant incidents. There may have been minor ones, but I don't
                    think anything serious came to our attention. This is one of the things I
                    learned early on, and that is that Tunisians and Moroccans did not automatically
                    follow the Arab policies. They were never pro-Israel, but they were not just
                    automatically pulled in to whatever Arab position was being adopted. And as for
                    the Suez, I'm sure that there were public manifestations, probably attempts to
                    collect funds and distribute various forms of assistance to Egypt and victims of
                    the war, but the governments were restrained.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Nasser? What was our reading? This was during
                        the period when we were really concerned about Nasser becoming the major
                        influence over the whole Arab world. How were we reading him as far as
                        Tunisia and Morocco were concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: In Morocco, the Voice of the Revolution, his Arabic radio station, was
                    widely listened to. As long as Morocco was not independent, it was a very
                    important rallying point; as soon as they got independence, it tapered off. And
                    Nasser did not respect Islam the way that good Moroccans would like and would
                    expect Islam to be treated. The king, as I say, has a religious role, and there
                    was no great sympathy in Morocco for Nasser, not at the governing levels. At the
                    popular levels, I'm sure people would say Nasser was popular, but when the final
                    choices had to be made, there was not great sympathy for him.</p>
                <p>Tunisia was much closer and there was not this same religious barrier.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bourguiba was very much a secular figure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Yes. But he had already taken his distance from strict Islam in a number
                    of ways. For example, allowing women to go without the veil, encouraging women
                    to be educated, giving women positions in government—something that still is
                    hardly done to this day in Morocco. If I'm not mistaken, Bourguiba was strong
                    enough to be confrontational at times with Nasser. But, again, that was
                    peripheral, and it didn't become an important factor in our relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking about relations, in NEA. Here NEA had a major
                        crisis with the Suez thing and all this. Did you all have the feeling that
                        dealing in the North African side, not including Egypt of course, but did
                        you feel that you were all kind of off on the back burners?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Yes. The Suez invasion we thought was an unfortunate event. And we were
                    worried that Eisenhower was going to go along with the French and British.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: We were worried, and it was a great relief when Eisenhower pulled
                    back.</p>
                <p>I wonder if Dulles really agreed with that? Dulles was such a colonialist in his
                    own mentality.</p>
                <p>But Eisenhower pulled back, and that spared relations between our two countries
                    (Morocco and the U.S.). It enabled us to go forward on virtually the same track
                    that we had been on when those events occurred.</p>
                <p>But you're right, we were peripheral. The Department kept sending requests for
                    people to go in and talk to the governments concerned. But I don't recall that
                    we had any real problems with either one.</p>
                <p>Suez Canal Users Association, do you remember that?</p>

                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Opinions were by no means undivided...in those days. But, as I say,
                    Eisenhower's action in taking his distance from the French and British actions
                    saved our relationship.</p>
                <p>I think Dulles would have done otherwise.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, he certainly didn't care for Nasser.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Oh, no, nor did we.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a palpable distaste, for both of them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Going back, covering both times, both as a Desk officer and, before that, serving
                    in Rabat, how were we reading the Moroccan Jews? Israel had been formed; very
                    confrontational in the Arab world. We had the example of what Hitler had done to
                    the Jews during World War II, the holocaust. And we had a strong Jewish lobby.
                    So we must have been looking at the Jewish situation very closely this whole
                    time.</p>
                <p>NORLAND: Do you know that Moroccan Jews, with few exceptions, were considered to
                    be protected by the king directly. They had what I'm sure would be described in
                    Moroccan law as a special status.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Prot�g�s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Prot�g�s, in a sense. But that has quite a different connotation.
                    There's another word for it, which I can't think of. It might come to you. But,
                    in any case, there was not the alarm in the Jewish community in Morocco that you
                    would find in some parts of the Arab world.</p>
                <p>Moroccans quietly made their way to Israel. There is no question about that. The
                    numbers were relatively restrained, I would say. And even to this day there are
                    important settlements of Moroccan Jews and Tunisian Jews who have stayed and who
                    have integrated and who seem to be satisfied. I don't think they have been the
                    object of government efforts to persecute them or to cause them harm. But things
                    go on very quietly in that field; there is not a great public announcement when
                    Jews leave Morocco or arrive in Israel.</p>
                <p>And yet the king has done some very interesting things. He met with Peres,
                    remember, in Fez.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Shimon Peres, who was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Who was then prime minister of Israel. Oh, that was a daring move. That
                    was only '86 or '85?</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Of course, the king has also done some unusual things. Do you remember the
                    Libyan-Moroccan agreement of 1984?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, one of these joint-nationality things that the
                        Arab world seems prone to. One just has to wait about two to three months,
                        and they're dead again.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: And, of course, there were such incompatibilities. By this time, I had
                    taken a particular interest in Qadhafi. Among other things, he's strongly
                    anti-monarchist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you got a very interesting assignment. You went to
                        Abidjan, where you served from '58 to '61.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Actually, I left in December of '60.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this assignment come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: [laughter] I tell you, it was an example of the Department personnel
                    system. I was working on the Moroccan Desk and was walking down the hall one
                    day, when I met Charlie Lemmo, an admin officer in AFEX (Executive Bureau).
                    Charlie said that our consul in Abidjan was being PNGed, and they were looking
                    around for someone to send out. Would I be interested? And I said of course I'd
                    be interested. I was tired of Washington; I'd been here almost three years.</p>
                <p>And so, on quite short notice, I was made consul in Ivory Coast, Abidjan. In
                    historical perspective it may be useful to note that I was only the second
                    consul. My predecessor had only been there for a year and a half (he came in
                    April '57 I believe), and until then we'd had no representation. We were still
                    living under the most elementary conditions—a two-bedroom house for my family. I
                    had two sons then, and a daughter was born there in March of 1959. According to
                    local historians, she was the second white child born in Abidjan. The French
                    would send their wives to France or upcountry to missionary hospitals; they
                    wouldn't think of having children born in Abidjan. We were having good luck with
                    a local French doctor, and didn't see any reason not to stay, although there
                    were no anesthetics or what you'd call modern hospital equipment. It was
                    pioneering in many respects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place, how did the consul get PNGed (persona
                        non grata)? And then what was the situation there when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>NORLAND: He got PNGed because he had not shown sufficient respect for the French.
                    He got picked up, apparently, and influenced...this is now hearsay, because I've
                    never been able to get the full facts, but people in Ivory Coast told me that he
                    allowed the Xerox copying machine in the consulate general to be used for
                    anti-French leaflets. Another one told me, on good authority, that he carried a
                    pistol. In several other ways he had reportedly insulted the French, so
                    blatantly that the man who was in charge of that country then, and is still
                    president today, Houphouet-Boigny, supported the French. Houphouet was friendly
                    with the French, and did not do anything to stop my predecessor from being
                    ousted. He couldn't probably have done much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you picked up anything while you were on the Desk, or
                        before you went out, about the man's attitude? Did you think this was
                        probably a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Yes, there was definitely something there. The Department didn't fight
                    it. That's usually the first sign that there's something going on. And my
                    predecessor didn't fight it. And his wife reportedly did not like Abidjan. They
                    were bridge players. And there was one person who was continuity and a source of
                    some of those reports. The CIA officer was Bill Dunbar. You may have heard of
                    him; he was later a historian of the CIA on Africa. Bill came to Dakar to meet
                    us and to escort us back to Abidjan; he told us that my predecessor had done a
                    lot of funny things. Bill was not one to make stories up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we're really talking about a personality problem and
                        not any real state to state...Well, when you went out there, you were
                        basically our representative to the Ivory Coast. This was before
                        independence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: This was two years before independence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was anybody saying, “Okay, Don, this is what we want out
                        of the Ivory Coast, and these are our interests there,” or anything like
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: There was so little knowledge about the country that I don't think we
                    could have fashioned a letter of instruction. What we did have (and this is
                    something which I'm prepared to document, because it really is a ridiculous
                    episode) we had a consul general in Dakar, and the consul general thought that
                    it could never happen that the rest of those countries in French West Africa
                    would become independent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the consul general?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>NORLAND: Don Dumont. And Don Dumont was so sure that the situation that existed
                    then was going to prevail that he could not believe that there was even a need
                    for another person to be assigned to Abidjan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he what you might call a French hand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Yes, he was. And his wife was French.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. This so often was the case for a long time. Dakar
                        was sort of our French outpost down there, and we sent the equivalent to the
                        American colonial officers out there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: That's right. And he actually was so convinced of this...And it was easy
                    to do if you've been to Dakar. You know there are those big, beautiful
                    buildings. The French had made of Dakar a real bureaucratic headquarters, a
                    center from which they governed all the rest of West Africa. And they did it by
                    having residents general in the other eight countries, but all reporting was
                    sent through Dakar, where they had a person of the stature of a minister. Louis
                    Joxe, for example, was one of the great governors general in Dakar. Don Dumont
                    got in that circuit and was convinced that we should not only agree with the
                    French to do things their way, but we should actively oppose independence in
                    these countries. And when I got to Abidjan, it didn't take me long to realize
                    that Houphouet-Boigny was not only a person of considerable stature in his own
                    right, he had been, remember, the number-three man in a post-war French
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: A minister of state (ministre d'etat) and minister of health; he was an
                    African doctor. A person of considerable stature within the RDA (Rassemblement
                    D�mocratique Africain), which was his political party in all of French West
                    Africa. But his Ivory Coast section of it, which was called the PDCI (Parti
                    D�mocratique de la Cote d'Ivoire), was his instrument, and, in addition to all
                    of his independent political power, he was engaged in a serious personal
                    conflict with Leopold Senghor, who was the man to become president of Senegal.
                    He didn't like Senghor, and the feeling was reciprocated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Too intellectual.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Senghor was intellectual. He had a French wife. He was writing poetry
                    for French audiences. He was an agr�g� in the French educational system. And he
                    became a member of the Acad�mie de France, which is to say, a veritable
                    Frenchman.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>When I got to Abidjan I could see there were going to be problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place, sort of a wiring diagram, to whom did
                        you report?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: That was a problem. I reported to Dakar, but I began to send copies of
                    my messages directly to Paris; we were still a colony under France. The first of
                    our visitors, in January '59, was Cecil Lyon, the U.S. minister to France. Very
                    shortly thereafter we had Ambassador Amory Houghton. So we understood that we
                    were reporting through France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were very definitely part of the French...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: That's right. Here, I'm quoting from a letter that Dumont wrote me in
                    1959.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, if you would like, we can include that at the
                        end. But, anyway, please quote.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: “Let me suggest, in the future, you send a personal note direct whenever
                    you find yourself in the kind of a fix that seems serious to you and calls for
                    prompt action. One other comment I would like to make concerns your distribution
                    of copies of communications to sundry individuals and organizations in the
                    Department. I think you ought to think twice before sending copies of your
                    communications to the four winds.</p>
                <p>“That is to say, if the substance is a matter requiring action on the part of the
                    consulate general, you should leave it to the discretion of this office to see
                    that the Department or the embassy in Paris is informed.”</p>
                <p>Dumont was upset at this. I couldn't prevent it if I had tried. I could not have
                    prevented this surge of independent thinking and emerging independence.</p>
                <p>At the time Houphouet was actually resisting independence. He said, “We're not
                    ready for it yet. In order to run a railroad, you need engineers,” was one of
                    his similes, “and we do not yet have those engineers.” So he was not an
                    extremist; but he wanted recognition as the leader of the Ivory Coast, and he
                    was starting to do things that were quite different from what they wanted done
                    in Dakar.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, he had resources. His country was in the tropical forest belt. They
                    had hardwoods, coffee, cocoa, pineapple. They had a base that made their GDP
                    dwarf that of Senegal, which only had peanuts, really, and a few other
                    things.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>So it was a matter of psychology in our not being able to adapt to this new
                    reality. And, furthermore, if Abidjan should get ideas about independence, then
                    what about all those other countries? And then what would happen to Dakar? Don
                    Dumont could not bring himself to consider that Dakar, like Vienna, was going to
                    become this massive head with almost no body or shoulders. He could not conceive
                    of that, and vented his feelings. And this letter...I had it out for other
                    reasons, which I'll tell you about, but it took a tremendous adjustment on his
                    part.</p>
                <p>Maybe I ought to finish this one story. He got so mad at me that he refused to
                    write an efficiency report on me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My God.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: It's hard to imagine. But in those days, it was not so unusual. At least
                    two inspectors were sent out. Bob Ware was one of them. They came to Abidjan,
                    went to Dakar, went to other posts, to try to figure out what it was that Don
                    Dumont was so upset about.</p>
                <p>I'm happy to tell you that, in each case, the inspectors came down on my side and
                    said, “All you're doing is reflecting what you are confronted with here. You're
                    reporting reality. Houphouet is running things here. He's not subordinate to
                    Dakar, and you shouldn't be, either.” Although I was careful always to send
                    Dakar copies, that wasn't enough.</p>
                <p>The upshot of this, and this becomes a key factor in my career, is that in the
                    summer of 1960, Africa got involved in the 1960 presidential campaign. John
                    Kennedy had made quite a hit by stressing our failure to support Algerian
                    independence and he decided to pay attention to Africa in general. So he sent
                    Averell Harriman around the circuit. That's another story. And the Department,
                    in response, sent Loy Henderson around in a private plane, with eight different
                    section heads from the Department, including the head of FBO, the head of MED,
                    AF personnel, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is a very famous trip.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: A famous trip, indeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A trip to go around to look to opening up Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Exactly, and to try to counter the Democratic Party calls for more
                    attention to Africa.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>Anyway, when Loy Henderson arrived in Abidjan, we got along well. John Stutesman
                    was his assistant. Vaughan Ferguson was with him, and I'd known Fergie earlier
                    when he was in Tangier. Henderson told me and others he was very satisfied with
                    his visit to Abidjan. And he took me to Ouagadougou, to look over the situation
                    there and to make decisions about whether we should have an embassy there and
                    elsewhere. On the plane I was sitting across from him and he said, “Well done,
                    thank you very much. Tell me, what's your status?”</p>
                <p>I said that I was an FSO-6.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: FSO Six.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: And that I hadn't had an efficiency report in 18 months. You should have
                    seen him react. “Why not? Whose responsibility was this? Why has this not been a
                    matter of record? What is going on here?” I told him of its Dakar-Abidjan
                    dispute. He sat down and dictated a two-paragraph telegram, which is somewhere
                    in the Department. About three months later, I was promoted. So Don Dumont
                    helped me get promoted.</p>
                <p>We came to Upper Volta, as it was then known, and I can remember him saying at
                    the time, as he did again after we visited Niamey, and again in Cotonou and
                    Togo, “Should we have an Embassy here?” After every visit, he would ask his
                    staff and me (since I was accredited to those other three countries) whether we
                    should have an embassy resident? And we would have these discussions; it was nip
                    and tuck. I really was not strongly in favor of having an embassy in each one of
                    these countries. I felt we could do it by traveling and reporting out of these
                    places. As a matter of fact, Brandon Grove, who came to Abidjan as vice consul
                    in 1959, went to Upper Volta, and he did a great report. And it convinced me
                    that we could cover this country if desired. Why did we want to get people
                    involved. I can remember Henderson saying, after he heard all these arguments,
                    “We'll have a resident ambassador in each country.” And that was the beginning
                    of a process we're now reviewing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it's a political decision, not an administrative
                        one, really.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: That's right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, in a way, fair enough.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Anyway, you can begin to see the feeling about this little post,
                    Abidjan, where we had little experience or interest. In Dakar, we'd had a
                    representative for decades, important people had been assigned there.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, also, it was extremely important during World War

                        capture it and didn't succeed and all that. Later, it became an extremely
                        important transshipment point, all across Africa, for the war in North
                        Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Absolutely. So it became a real battle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We haven't talked about how you reported on these other
                        countries, and then your relations with Houphouet-Boigny. We really haven't
                        gotten into any of the politics of the thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: To illustrate the situation, I might note that as soon as I got to
                    Abidjan, the decision was made to include Upper Volta within our jurisdiction.
                    Even Dakar recognized that they couldn't travel there as easily as we could. We
                    even had a railroad from Abidjan to Ouagadougou; it's still there.</p>
                <p>Then Houphouet, showing his independence and his ability to organize, and wanting
                    to move gradually and intelligently to independence, created an organization
                    called the Conseil de l'Entente, which translates into the Council of
                    Understanding, consisting of Ivory Coast, Upper Volta, Niger, and Dahomey
                    (Benin). And they signed a protocol that provided essentially that Ivory Coast
                    would help its poorer neighbors. I made three or four trips on business to each
                    of these countries, and so I was accredited to all four.</p>
                <p>In May of 1960, Houphouet told me one day, “I can't resist any longer. We're
                    going for independence.” Consider this in the context of West Africa at the
                    time. Senghor had decided he was going to go for independence; Mali was out of
                    control under Modibo Keita. Houphouet couldn't resist any longer.</p>
                <p>When I communicated this to the Department, they had nothing better to do than to
                    say, “You will be accredited to all four.”</p>
                <p>When an independence date was set, the French decided to send two ministers and
                    an airplane down to Abidjan to pick up Houphouet and take him to the other three
                    countries to celebrate independence. I asked for and was given authority to go
                    on the same plane. The British also sent a representative. We were the only two
                    non-French foreigners.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>On the last day of July 1960, we took the plane to Cotonou, which is the [de
                    facto] capital of Benin, then known as Dahomey, and we went through independence
                    ceremonies for Dahomey on August 1, 1960. A day later, we took the plane to
                    Niamey; on the 3rd of August 1960. I presented letters recognizing the
                    independence of Niger. We flew on to Upper Volta and presented letters
                    recognizing the independence of Upper Volta on August 5. Back to Abidjan, on the
                    7th of August 1960, I presented the letters recognizing the independence of
                    Ivory Coast. The text of those letters is in the Digest of International
                    Law.</p>
                <p>So I had the unusual experience of traveling around in a French plane, with
                    French ministers, Houphouet, representatives of different organizations, to
                    confirm this advance of countries to independence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that the consul general in Dakar
                        would have grabbed this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: He was so upset that I don't think he could have enjoyed it. Maybe
                    that's one of the reasons they didn't send someone from the States. A year
                    later, Robert Kennedy attended the first anniversary of Ivory Coast's
                    independence.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: In that sense, it reflected the true dimensions of our interests.
                    Because what did we have? We actually had some interest in Ivory Coast. American
                    missionaries made it possible to travel around. Houphouet told me once, that it
                    was the American missionaries of the CMA (Christian and Missionary Alliance) who
                    enabled him to read in his own language, which was Baule. They were the first to
                    put the Baule language in Western script. That made a big impression on him. Of
                    course, as you know, he converted to Catholicism and is a major figure in the
                    church. He built the largest basilica in the world.</p>

                        with Ambassador Don Norland. Don, we left off more or less where you, as a
                        relatively junior officer, had just made this very interesting trip
                        recognizing these various governments. We might backtrack just a bit, but on
                        this, you were mentioning how little regard anyone was paying to these at

                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>NORLAND: That's correct.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because really the new wind came in with the Kennedy
                        administration. What was your impression about that time, and anything you

                        viability of countries such as...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Well, we're talking about all of West and Equatorial Africa. Those were
                    the countries of interest to me at the time, and they were all ex-French
                    colonies.</p>
                <p>I might just take a second to recall that the subject of West Africa became an
                    issue in the 1960 elections. It was triggered in part by a long history that
                    Jack Kennedy had of making some public declaration on Third World issues. In
                    1957, for example, he made a speech on the Senate floor suggesting that the
                    United States was on the wrong track in the Algerian-French war. It was
                    diplomatic but clear.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, Bill Porter was then director of the Office of North African
                    Affairs. It turns out that Bill had been briefing Jack Kennedy. Both were from
                    Massachusetts. I'm sorry that Bill died and was not able to give us an insight
                    on those contacts.</p>
                <p>To make a long story short, Kennedy saw that there was some advantage to publicly
                    question these colonial arrangements. (Remember, this was 1957. You'd think we
                    would have learned something twelve years after World War II.) And this had its
                    effect in 1960 when he sent Averell Harriman around to West Africa to try to
                    accelerate American interests in that part of the world. And Harriman came to
                    Liberia, where I went from Abidjan to meet him. He spent three days, I believe,
                    In Abidjan, and then went on to Brazzaville. And my memento of this is this book
                    which he gave me at the time, which is a reminder to me of the date.</p>

                <p>NORLAND: I think that's the reason he was chosen. He could not be accused of

                    other-than-serious and objective policy assessment.</p>
                <p>He went around, and, in talking with Houphouet-Boigny surprisingly found a
                    comparable statesman. Houphouet acted the statesman role. He had an active
                    private correspondence with Charles de Gaulle, and occasionally would read me
                    excerpts from Charles de Gaulle's letters. There was never any suggestion in
                    Houphouet's behavior that he was a supplicant or considered himself at a lower
                    level than de Gaulle. It wasn't “I'm writing to the great man;” it was “I have
                    found someone with whom I can correspond on equal terms.” One of the most
                    interesting correspondence that I hope we will be able to read one day will be
                    the private correspondence of de Gaulle and Houphouet.</p>
                <p>So when Harriman came, he found this man who had been a minister in the French
                    government—Houphouet had been the number-three in the French government—i.e. a
                    minister of state. He had also been associated with the Communists at one time
                    in order to advance the objectives of his RDA Party to obtain things he wanted,
                    e.g., the abolition of forced labor. People don't realize that there was forced
                    labor in the colonies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, the couve or whatever.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Corv�e. Houphouet succeeded in making himself a player in French
                    politics.</p>
                <p>So when Harriman came, they were talking a very high level of diplomatic
                    discourse. It had to do with the Soviet Union, which, incidentally, Houphouet
                    detested. Way back then, no one will ever find any chink in his anti-Soviet
                    armor. He had made that alliance in French politics for very practical reasons;
                    there was nothing ideological. He was a strong Catholic, as we later discovered
                    when he built his basilica. So it was a very compatible meeting.</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact (I didn't bring it because it's a big book), I have pictures
                    of a great soir�e that Houphouet organized on 24-hour notice to honor Averell
                    Harriman. It was a soir�e dansant, outdoors, beautifully done. In Africa you can
                    tell when someone is trying to truly honor a visitor. They go all out, the
                    dancers, the best of the food, waiters. This was the Houphouet's reception for
                    Harriman.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>Harriman left with great appreciation for Houphouet's statesmanlike qualities.
                    I'm confident he used that expression. I have a letter, as a matter of fact,
                    from Martin Herz in my files that says that he heard Harriman speak in New York
                    at the Council of Foreign Relations in the fall of 1960, and he referred to
                    Houphouet's standing as a statesman and as someone who had an understanding of
                    the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well no, I'd like to pursue this a bit. When you look at
                        this, and, again, I speak as objectively as one can, because I'm not an
                        African hand, I'm wondering whether somebody like Houphouet-Boigny and a few
                        of these other leaders gave sort of an erroneous impression of what we would
                        be dealing with—our AID programs and our relations and all this. You had
                        these highly educated, very sophisticated, and very effective leaders, a few
                        of them, and yet did they fully reflect what their country was, the
                        potential? Or were they just sort of a veneer on the top, and down below you
                        had real African nations, with all the cultural and everything else problems
                        that we were going to come up against?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Well, Houphouet never dissimulated as far as the status of his country
                    was concerned. And, as a matter of fact, one of the most important comments I
                    could make on that question is to say that Houphouet was a reluctant figure in
                    bringing Ivory Coast to independence as early as he did. He was forced into it
                    by other events, most especially the referendum in Guinea in September of 1958,
                    where, of all the African countries, Guinea decided to refuse de Gaulle's offer
                    of a French Community of which they would be part. It would have been autonomy.
                    But he [S�kou Tour�} said, “No, we want independence.” Houphouet always
                    considered S�kou as a young brother (un jeune fr�re).</p>
                <p>Houphouet was able to resist the appeal of independence because of his standing
                    and because of his rationale, which I often heard privately. He didn't say it
                    publicly too often. His rationale was: We are not ready. His example (I believe
                    it's in books) that he used to refer to is: “If you are going to have a
                    railroad, and you want an engineer, you've got to have a trained engineer. You
                    can't run a railroad with untrained people, and you can't run a government with
                    untrained people.”</p>
                <p>He was notorious, considered so by even his Ivory Coast colleagues, his fellow
                    government ministers, for the degree to which he was willing to allow the French
                    civil servants to remain in positions of authority in his own government. That
                    reflected his view that the country was not yet ready for independence.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>When it came, he asked many of those civil servants to stay on in their
                    positions. And they remained. It's only gradually that he worked Ivorians
                    in...even among his immediate staff. Two come to mind, for example. One was from
                    Algeria, virtually French in his training and his capacities. The other from
                    Martinique, also very much a French-trained civil servant. The names are Belkiri
                    and Nairay. Those two are there even today. I recently talked with our
                    ambassador to the Ivory Coast, and asked him to greet Gouverneur Nairay and
                    Monsieur Belkiri.</p>
                <p>That shows Houphouet's desire for efficiency in administration and in the
                    economy. He encouraged the French colons (the French colonizers), the French
                    farmers, to remain. He encouraged French businessmen. He made deals with them.
                    There was an element (this will not be published, I'm sure) but there was an
                    element of continuity there that reflected Houphouet's honest appreciation (to
                    get back to your question) of the Ivory Coast's ability to be a fully
                    independent state and play the game that had to be played in the modern world,
                    particularly the world economy. So Houphouet was trying to ease this transition.
                    He recognized the weaknesses in his society. And that's one of the reasons that
                    he put a lot of emphasis on building universities, of sending people to France,
                    bringing French universities to Africa. I think he's probably considered
                    successful in doing that.</p>
                <p>What was less successful, and this is where I think your question leads to a
                    whole other domain: he left French in positions of responsibility for the
                    economy, and they tended to exploit the country without much consideration for
                    the long-term effect that it would have. For example, they cut ninety percent of
                    the tropical hardwoods; only something like ten percent remains.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's considered one of the great ecological country
                        disasters.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: No question about it. Despite his anxiety to achieve this status as a
                    responsible, respectable nation, Houphouet didn't want independence just for the
                    prestige or for the position in the United Nations. He scoffed at that—he wanted
                    to be a modern nation in every sense of the word, for which education was key.
                    For that he needed economic development, so he encouraged all-out production of
                    cocoa and coffee and pineapple, which were his three principal agricultural
                    commodities, and he encouraged it to the point that there was overproduction.
                    And if you look at the history of the 1980s, it's clear it produced well beyond
                    the capacity of the world market to absorb these products.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'd better quickly go back to the period we're talking
                        about and concentrate on that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time, I take it that you, as with everyone else,
                        were very impressed by Houphouet-Boigny. Or did you have reservations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: First of all, there was the personal angle. I was very fortunate to get
                    along with him well, to the point that he would allow me to come and see him
                    early in the morning, when he was sure that the French high commissioner would
                    not monitor our meetings; the French high commissioner discouraged my seeing
                    Houphouet on a bilateral basis before independence. Even after independence, the
                    French mentality was to keep what they thought was an Ivorian money machine.
                    They thought it was a productive country with great possibilities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the jewel of their colonial crown.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: This was one of the jewels. It was an economically viable country, and
                    the French treated it as such. It had resources; agricultural and, not so much
                    mineral, but fishing.</p>
                <p>So Houphouet was willing to deal very honestly. I could give you examples.</p>
                <p>But at the same time, I saw that he was so concerned about his relationship with
                    France that he was losing contact with his own people. He had his political
                    party, the PDCI, and I attended several conferences where he would take the
                    podium for hours. He was the master, he was the teacher, the professor, treating
                    his own people as students, disciples and expecting them to follow.</p>
                <p>He was not harsh in dealing with those who didn't agree. But there was a lot of
                    quiet unrest, of intellectual effervescence. A friend of mine, who I believe,
                    committed suicide, then minister of education, Ernest Boka, lived near me, so I
                    used to see him quite often. He was most ill-at-ease with this paternalistic (I
                    think that's the word that I would emphasize) attitude of Houphouet-Boigny.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was very definitely during this period when you
                        were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Fifty-nine and sixty. Right.</p>
                <p>So, to answer your question as to how I viewed Houphouet, I saw him as being so
                    eager to move forward on his agenda for modernization that he was not able to
                    bring his people along in a way that would ensure success and long-term
                    stability.</p>
                <p>I was wrong. He's lasted until today.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>But it was not a healthy situation. Perhaps symbolic of his was his treatment of
                    who would be his successor. For a long time it was a man named Philippe Yace.
                    Meanwhile, he had oscillated—it was Konan Bedie, minister Denise. He'd go back
                    and forth on who he was going to consider his successor if he should pass from
                    the scene. He never wanted to take the issue seriously. And he didn't consult on
                    the subject. He was somewhat imperious, a government dictated from the top.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the other countries to which you had
                        representation? How did you view these at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: I can tell you that I was struck by the fact (I have it in my own
                    correspondence, and in reports at the time) that they were not economically
                    viable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These countries were which?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Upper Volta, it was then called; Niger; and what was known as Dahomey.
                    Now it's Benin. There was not the infrastructure. Their local legislative bodies
                    were not representative. There was little trained manpower. And not many French
                    were interested or willing or ordered to go to these countries, compared to
                    Ivory Coast where the numbers were large. I think there were seventy-five
                    thousand French of a population of five million. Now it's up to eleven million
                    by the way. But the other countries were not promising.</p>
                <p>For example, in Upper Volta, the leading tribe, the leading ethnic group, are the
                    Mossi. They had a traditional leader, the Moro Naba [great lord] (you can hear
                    the Mossi in that word moro), who was someone that I was told I should
                    definitely call on. I called him the Moro Naba, a person with little education,
                    if any, who was living in a completely traditional tribal atmosphere. He could
                    be used to bring along his followers and to get them to support the government,
                    but the government was largely an outgrowth of French colonialism. The president
                    was Maurice Yam�ogo, who happened to be in the position of responsibility in the
                    RDA, which Houphouet controlled. But he had a high school education and was not
                    a person able to bring the country along. He didn't last more than about two
                    years.</p>
                <p>In Niger, there was a very nice fellow, Hamani Diori, who had the education, and
                    he had a couple of people around him who were very good. Niger is a huge
                    country, adjacent to Chad. Again, divided ethnically. There were those near
                    Nigeria, where the bulk of the population lived, against the nomads in the
                    north. And now, after many years of passive resistance, the nomads, known as
                    Tuareg, are in virtually open revolt against the capital, Niamey. It's an
                    artificial state. It's huge; almost a third the size of the United States. It
                    doesn't show up there, on your map, because Africa itself is large. And what is
                    it that could link that country together and make it viable? Indeed, very
                    little.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>The same with Benin, a country that has three distinct tribal and political
                    groupings: the north, the middle, and the south. When independence came, a man
                    from the north became president. And he was so insecure, because the people from
                    the south were actually more numerous and he was worried about his fate. He
                    didn't last long.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In those days, I take it, we were just trying to basically
                        touch base. Did you really think that we were going to be putting embassies
                        in those places at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: There is a tie-in to the Harriman visit. When Eisenhower and Herter
                    heard about this visit of Harriman's, they said, “Oh, my God, we can't let this
                    go unanswered, so we're going to send a team of people to Africa and really take
                    our own assessment.” Have you heard of this trip before?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard of this trip. I'd like your impression of how
                        it hit, because it's a very famous trip.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: The Loy Henderson trip.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the Henderson trip, of going around, sort of a
                        caravan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: It was a flying staff meeting. He brought along something like seven
                    office heads, including head of FBO; head of MED; Vaughan Ferguson was head of
                    West African Affairs; head of Personnel. And they came in, in a four-engined
                    plane, to Abidjan. I had made several tours to the other three countries, so I
                    knew roughly what it was all about. They were assessing (the answer to your
                    question) what should be done. They didn't want to appear to be negligent in the
                    face of the Harriman trip and Kennedy's subtle emphasis on the United States
                    assuming its rightful position in encouraging countries to become independent.
                    And that's a very important point; that was the background here.</p>
                <p>So Henderson came out, and we had talks. I'm sure we met with Houphouet, although
                    there was only a courtesy call. It was mostly in-house, and we were talking
                    about what we could do to advance U.S. national interests, to improve the status
                    of the embassy, etc.</p>
                <p>On this plane en route to Upper Volta, as it was known in those days, I was
                    sitting in a compartment with Henderson, John Stutesman, and, I think, Vaughan
                    Ferguson, and Henderson turned to me and said, “Well, should we have independent
                    embassies in these places?” My first reaction was: no. I thought we were doing a
                    credible job, and I thought that it could be done with a resident charg� and a
                    floating ambassador.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>And there were other reasons for this, by the way. Let me just mention one.
                    Houphouet himself recognized the non-viability of these other three countries,
                    so he created an institution called the Conseil de l'Entente which, as you can
                    tell, says very little; it says a Council of Understanding. What it did that was
                    of importance was to say that every country was going to pool a certain
                    percentage of its GNP, and from that pool, allocations would be made of what
                    amounted to foreign assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which basically was that the Ivory Coast would be helping
                        these other three countries.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Exactly. And that was to do two things: strengthen Houphouet's role; and
                    protect him from the criticism that Houphouet was going off on his own and not
                    paying any attention to his African brothers, who were less favored by nature.
                    So it was building a backfire of protection.</p>
                <p>But the Conseil de l'Entente was operating. The other chiefs of state had their
                    separate villas in Abidjan, where they would often meet. I could meet with them
                    there; I didn't have to run around. Which was not easy, by the way, taking those
                    old DC-3s, and trying to get hotel rooms, where the telephones didn't work.</p>
                <p>I didn't see that we had anything really to gain in this part of the world by
                    having independent representation. I'm sure I'm on record as having said this.
                    As I say, maybe my reasons were a little bit self-serving at the time, but I had
                    reasons for saying that we could do it if we wanted to.</p>
                <p>And so we went on, and Henderson reflected and consulted others. Vaughan
                    Ferguson, I remember, said, “I think we have to have separate embassies.” They
                    were making assessments based not just on local conditions in West Africa, but
                    on conditions in West Africa, but on conditions in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the United Nations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: And the spirit of the continent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were internal American black politics, the black voter,
                        mentioned at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mentioned on the plane?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>NORLAND: Yes. Not only the American vote, but the United Nations' appeal, and the
                    atmosphere of the times, which was decolonization. It was liberation; it was
                    something bigger than West Africa, of course.</p>
                <p>Anyway, to finish the story, we also went to Togo. But after we got out of
                    Ouagadougou, Henderson said, “Well, what do you think now?” I'd showed him where
                    I thought we should have the embassies. I had been there earlier to identify
                    land that was available for either purchase where we could build embassies or
                    office space we could rent, where we could get to work and start operating. But
                    I remember leaving Upper Volta, and he went around again and said, “What do you
                    think?”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Well, my view hasn't changed.”</p>
                <p>At the end, he said simply: “We will open embassies here.” I'm sure he made that
                    declaration. And from then on, it was set. I think he made the decision after
                    Upper Volta. You couldn't, then, say, “Well, we won't have an embassy in Niger,”
                    or Dahomey.</p>
                <p>It was un-Henderson-like, in my opinion. I think he was, himself, reflecting the
                    feelings in Washington and his rather close relationships in the Eisenhower
                    administration. He was not an ordinary FSO. And I think he felt that he would be
                    doing Eisenhower and the Republican Party a great service by showing this
                    sensitivity.</p>
                <p>That's the Henderson trip.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: I think I started to read from the Dumont letter last time, telling me
                    to keep my aspirations limited here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the consul general in Dakar.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: He was the consul general in Dakar.</p>
                <p>Out of, I guess it was Ouagadougou, Henderson turned to me and said, “Gee, you've
                    done a lot of work here. You're obviously well regarded. You can get
                    appointments, and the people treat you well. When were you last promoted?”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Sir, I haven't had an efficiency report for over a year and a
                    half.”</p>
                <p>“Why, that's not possible,” he said.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>I said, “Well, it's just that we've had this little argument with consul general,
                    Dakar, and this is his way of taking revenge.”</p>
                <p>He sat down and dictated to John Stutesman a telegram to Washington, outlining
                    the situation and saying that I'd done a good job and I hadn't had a report.</p>
                <p>I was promoted in about three months. It's one of the few times I've heard of
                    what amounted to a field promotion. So I was very grateful to Mr. Henderson. And
                    it settled, once and for all, the argument that I'd had with consul general,
                    Dakar, I can tell you that.</p>
                <p>So it was an interesting trip.</p>
                <p>And then, of course, he went on to do virtually the same thing in Equatorial
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you couldn't say West Africa gets this; Equatorial
                        Africa gets something different.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time, both before and during this trip, were there
                        concerns about great tribal unrest, the boundaries getting shoved around and
                        all? How did you feel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Not the boundaries. There were some difficulties with neighbors, but
                    they were mostly psychological. The differences between Ivory Coast and Ghana
                    were remarkable. First of all, Nkrumah had taken a quite different tack. He
                    said, “Seek ye first the political kingdom, and all else shall be granted unto
                    you.” And Houphouet said, “That's not right.” He told me and he told others,
                    “You have to have an economic base.” And then there was the famous bet. Have you
                    heard of the wager?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Houphouet and Nkrumah apparently communicated, and at one point they bet
                    which country would be farthest along twenty-five years hence. This is in a book
                    that I have seen recently, reference to this wager. Whether it's apocryphal or
                    not, I can't say, but I believe it's true.</p>
                <p>Nkrumah took the road of revolutionary rhetoric, and this misguided idea of
                    focusing first on African unity. That's probably the notion that caused Nkrumah
                    to stumble and fall.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Houphouet was quite the opposite: build with the resources you have; earn your
                    position as a truly independent and responsible and prosperous nation in the
                    world before you aspire to do all these other things. He ridiculed Nkrumah.</p>
                <p>That set up tensions between the two countries, but the border between the two
                    was almost impenetrable. People could go back and forth by water but we couldn't
                    drive directly across. The one time I drove into Ghana, we had to go as far
                    north as Kumasi. Now, I'm told, there are bridges across the rivers. It was
                    difficult. So tribal groupings could go back and forth without paying attention.
                    And there are linguistic and ethnic ties among the various tribes on the
                    coast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the debates that academics play with a lot in the
                        United States is that these country boundaries were artificial ones imposed
                        by the colonial rule, that somehow the white imperialist did a terrible
                        disservice to these African countries, and, because of this, they don't
                        really come up with other boundaries. Again, I'm trying to go back to the
                        time. Was it an article of faith, sort of, with you and the men on the plane
                        and others, that, boy, we better keep these boundaries, because if we mess
                        around with the boundaries to make them more equitable tribalwise, all hell
                        will break loose? Or did you just feel that the boundaries were there and
                        they were accepted by the people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: There had already developed a cultural veneer, applied externally, I
                    must say, that made some sense out of those boundaries. In the case of Ivory
                    Coast, for example, on the one hand you had Ghana, where the leadership was
                    English speaking. Nkrumah had been trained in this country and in Britain.
                    Houphouet was essentially Francophone. And that had already made a significant
                    difference. It had been sixty years that the French educational system had been
                    the dominant force, if not the only educational system of any consequence, in
                    Ivory Coast. And I think the same thing could be said of the English in Ghana.
                    Instruction in the indigenous schools, wherever they might have been, except for
                    Koranic schools in some places in the north, was in English. Liberia had become
                    Anglophone at this time. So there were differences in language.</p>
                <p>There was a lot of talk about linking the French-speaking countries of West
                    Africa into a larger unit. That reflected the view of Dakar, not just the
                    American, but especially the French. There was a feeling that these countries
                    were not big enough to be viable economically; they had to be linked to larger
                    units.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>But Houphouet's point continued to dominate; namely, we have to have something to
                    link up. What good does it do to link up vacant or unproductive spaces? We don't
                    have infrastructure; we don't have railroads. There was a railroad to
                    Ouagadougou, but the airlines were not very useful and the roads were poor. So
                    what good does it do to talk about either regional organizations or aspire to
                    control the territory next door? The borders were virtually meaningless in West
                    Africa. That was not the same in other parts of Africa, but in West Africa I
                    don't think it was a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it wasn't an issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Border disagreements emerged, e.g. between Mali and Burkina Faso. And
                    Houphouet succeeded in preventing a war from occurring between these two, in
                    about 1983-84. But that came later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in the Ivory Coast?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: I was in the Ivory Coast until late 1960. I came in '58, and I left in
                    '60.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you left before the American administration
                        changed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: That's right. But the new charg� had already been appointed, Bob Reams.
                    There was a perfect example of the way things were done in those days. I can
                    remember Loy Henderson, back in Abidjan after we'd made this trip in (I believe
                    he was back in Abidjan), and he said, “Well, now we've decided we're going to
                    have ambassadors, who should be the ambassador?” I've got my friend Bob Reams,
                    who's in Syria, I'm going to see if he wouldn't be available for down here.” So
                    he sent a telegram off, and Bob Reams was there before I left in December of
                    1960. I'll tell you about Bob Reams later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He comes back in a different period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: No, but his son is a friend of mine in the Foreign Service, and a nice
                    guy, and I wouldn't want to say anything about his father if it might get out.
                    Just one word: his father was not much interested in black Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this was true of a good number of appointments
                        within the Foreign Service.</hi>

                <p>NORLAND: That's right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was sort of a reflection of later on in Vietnam. ...to

                        still playing the old...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: The old-boy game. That's right. It was kind of pitiful. Bob Reams
                    arrived and, within hours, was sitting in the office reading Time magazine. He
                    had no particular interest in the people of issue. It was an example of how the
                    Service could be run at that time. Loy Henderson didn't have to call on anybody
                    or ask anybody's permission to assign these individuals. He wanted to name
                    Fergie (Vaughan Ferguson) as ambassador to Burkina Faso, on the spot. Fergie
                    resisted by saying he had other obligations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Henderson ran the Foreign Service Personnel Department
                        sort of as his private fiefdom, not in really a bad way, but it wasn't
                        always well suited. I have tales of people coming out of the men's room and
                        meeting Henderson, who'd say, “Where are you going?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>And they'd say, “I'm going to X.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, you don't want to go to X; I'll send you to Y.” And off they'd go to Y.</p>
                <p>It was of this kind of personal nature, but at that point it was really getting
                    beyond the fact that you could control these things.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>NORLAND: Yes, because the numbers were becoming very significant. In 1960 alone,
                    seventeen African countries became independent. And he had no particular
                    interest or knowledge in the area, so it was natural that he would say, “Well,
                    it doesn't matter.” Damn it, I hate to tell you this, but this was an attitude
                    that prevailed even two decades later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Africa, this is sort of an aside, but I can't tell
                        you the number of ambassadors that I've interviewed who were ambassadors
                        because they had done very well somewhere else—Latin America, Southeast
                        Asia. But there was no room for them there to get the equivalent to a
                        tombstone promotion.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: So true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you feel at the time? When you left, did you
                        say, “This is for me; I want to be an Africanist?” What was the mood? Was
                        this considered a place not to go, or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Things were not easy in Abidjan the first year and a half. We were
                    living under very difficult conditions. My wife had a baby there. As noted
                    earlier, I'm told it was the second white child born in Abidjan. The French
                    would send their wives back to France, of course, and sometimes upcountry to
                    missionary hospitals. But we lived in a house that had two air conditioners. It
                    was across the street from a military encampment with open sewers. The
                    atmosphere was really Third World, I can assure you. I remember telling Joe
                    Satterthwaite that we really had to start to think about living somewhere else.
                    And, of course, he was under the influence of Dumont, who said, “Don't bother to
                    build anything in Abidjan. It's just going to remain a little consulate.” But
                    Joe Satterthwaite personally intervened with FBO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his position at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: His position was assistant secretary for Africa. I think he was the
                    first full-time incumbent, because for a long time, it was in NEA, and the “A”
                    stood for Africa. Joe Satterthwaite came out and saw the conditions and problems
                    in trying to represent the United States. And he said, “I'll do what I can.” And
                    he authorized me to make a deal for what's called a lease-purchase arrangement.
                    We paid a certain amount per month, a fairly exalted rent. I think it was only a
                    couple of thousand dollars a month; in those days, that was a lot. And that sum
                    would be applied to the purchase of a new residence. We started the building,
                    and actually lived in the residence which much-expanded with a swimming pool and
                    so forth, is now the residence of the American ambassador to the Ivory
                    Coast.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>But living conditions the first few months were such that we were worried about
                    medical problems. Fortunately, we had what we thought were two good French
                    doctors, who gained the confidence of my wife, so she stayed there to have our
                    baby.</p>
                <p>Living in the new conditions was difficult because of the climate. It's a hot
                    climate, with high humidity, but it didn't bother me personally too much. And I
                    saw that Ivory Coast did have the potential, if it could utilize the resources,
                    to become a modern nation-state. I thought that was interesting. I saw that the
                    others really were not as promising.</p>
                <p>I realized that I was something of a pioneer, being accredited to four countries
                    at once, and to go around, for administrative reasons, to identify properties. I
                    was there to greet the first AID mission in 1960 before I left. It was headed by
                    an officer named Bill Masocco and included Pierre Sales. I can still remember
                    them coming over and saying, “Here we are; we're going to help people.” There
                    was all of this sense of expectation. There was this phrase at the time: rising
                    expectations, remember?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: It was an interesting time. I was ready for additional African
                    assignments if they had come along. But I was also ready for a change. I left
                    Abidjan on orders to go to The Netherlands, which I thought would be an
                    excellent antidote. It turned out that somebody else heard about the Netherlands
                    assignment before I did, so I went to NATO Paris instead. That too was a good
                    antidote to Ivory Coast. And yet (I'm reflecting now on the overall experience),
                    when it came to assessing what one was called upon to do, in terms of
                    responsibility, in terms of administrative challenges and the potential for
                    pioneering in a new area, Africa had many more challenges.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My first post was Frankfurt, Germany, and I was due for
                        assignment in '58, and I remember getting very excited, with my wife: “Boy,
                        things are going to open up in Africa.” They were talking about opening a
                        post in Nigeria, in Kano, and I put this down. Of course, I ended up in
                        Saudi Arabia. But at the time, it looked exciting, as an opportunity.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: That's understandable. For me, the difference was the degree of
                    responsibility. Everything's relative. But in Abidjan I never felt I was dealing
                    with a tinhorn dictator at some remote outpost. I felt I was dealing with
                    someone who not only had influence in Ivory Coast, but in all Africa and in the
                    French political system. He spent too much time in France (that became one of
                    his weaknesses), and was too solicitous of French views. But, compared to my
                    duties when I got to Europe...I mean, NATO was relative drudgery.</p>

                <p>NORLAND: Well, let me see. I had gotten that promotion. I was a Five. Maybe I was
                    a Four by then.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Yes, that's right. In NATO, there was an Economic, a Military and a
                    Political Division. And in NATO there was an institution called the Political
                    Advisors' Committee, POLADS. Do you remember that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Well, a lot of people have been assigned to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, but explain what it is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: It was the weekly meeting of representatives, the so-called political
                    advisors of the permanent representatives of the then-fourteen NATO countries.
                    Their mandate was to talk about non-NATO areas, to coordinate policies and share
                    information. The so-called permreps, permanent representatives, the ambassadors,
                    talked about the major NATO problems; force structures and armaments, as well as
                    the major political issues and what we were doing to counter the Soviets. But
                    POLADS existed to talk about non-NATO issues and areas. And one of those areas
                    was Africa. But the level of discourse was generally uninformed and there was so
                    little interest except for the French and British, the result was a desultory
                    discussion. There was no particular agenda; we were just comparing notes.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>And the most frustrating thing at NATO was that there was little room for
                    individual initiative. I might sit there and say, “My God, we ought to be
                    talking to our allies about a Cuban initiative, or a Chinese visit.” I couldn't
                    raise it unless we had instructions from Washington. Everything said in POLADS
                    was of interest only if it was on instruction.</p>
                <p>Now you could have some interesting discussions behind the scenes with people,
                    but there was not that much interest in Africa or the Third World generally.
                    Much more interesting, was Eastern Europe or the Middle East. The agenda
                    depended on the person who represented the country in the POLADS. But it was
                    generally boring, almost mechanical. I can remember the language of the weekly
                    telegram: “Request instructions on the following agenda items for the POLADS
                    meeting on Tuesday.” And you'd get back a telegram saying, “Here is what you
                    answer; here is what you're authorized to say.” And you didn't go beyond
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A major issue during the time you were there was the
                        Congo.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Well, no, the Congo was a little bit before. I was still in Ivory Coast
                    in the fall of '60, when the Congo really broke. In '61, there was still some
                    effect, it's true, but the most important issue in my time was the Cuban Missile
                    Crisis. And I did hear Dean Rusk when he came over. I guess we were all allowed
                    to sit in, but it wasn't usual that you could sit in and hear the high
                    officials.</p>
                <p>And, as you know, the other thing is that the staff was filled with people who
                    were not Foreign Service; they were Washington bureaucrats, who had agreed, very
                    reluctantly in most cases, to have one assignment overseas, in response to the
                    requirements of Wristonization. They were there reluctantly, and they didn't
                    have a sense of unit organization or cohesion. Many of them were not even
                    communicative. (I'll give you names if you'd like; some of them are still
                    living.) And they wanted to treat this like INR or like the PM Bureau.</p>
                <p>Intellectually, it was really not very challenging. I had had considerable
                    experience dealing directly with chiefs of state—with chiefs of small states to
                    be sure. But when the French officials came to Abidjan, they were often of
                    ministerial rank, and I'd dealt with them. In Paris, maybe I'd get a deputy
                    office director as an interlocutor; so it wasn't very exciting.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>But we did have a good experience in France. We lived near Versailles. We
                    couldn't afford anything in town; the prices were astronomical, by our
                    standards. I mean, a $600 a month allowance didn't go far and ours would have
                    been close to $300. As a sidelight illustrating the charm of the Foreign Service
                    we looked for housing a little farther from Paris. One day, I stopped at a
                    housing office in the NATO headquarters, and someone had just put in an
                    invitation to people to live in a country house on the edge of Versailles, in a
                    town called Chesnay...a house we would share. We looked into it and it turned
                    out to be a small chateau that had been built by a brother of Louis XVI. It was
                    an historical monument, but the family happened to be in financial straits. It
                    had been the country house of a fairly well-known French painter named
                    Jean-Louis Forain. And the family was willing to divide the chateau in two; we
                    would live in one-half; they the other. This meant improvising a kitchen and a
                    bathroom upstairs. But downstairs was a salon where they had any number of
                    Forain paintings, some of them sitting on easels. So we lived in an artist's
                    former studio. And there was a glorious park behind it. One kilometer down the
                    road was the Porte Saint-Antoine, which leads into the gardens of Versailles,
                    where I sometimes did my jogging. I had the most wonderful sense of getting
                    closely acquainted with Versailles. A couple of other colleagues lived in
                    Versailles, because they couldn't pay these Paris prices. Among them Al Reifman
                    and Abe Katz, economic advisors at OECD; another officer assigned to NATO
                    secretary general Luns, was Pete Van Campen. We would carpool which was always
                    interesting. It was always hard to get to Paris if you didn't carpool, because
                    there was no good public transportation. There was something called the PV,
                    Paris-Versailles, a taxi; you paid a couple of hundred francs, in those days. To
                    have easy access to Paris was very nice.</p>
                <p>And so I enjoyed my tour but not because of anything that happened in NATO. NATO
                    was pretty prosaic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for how de Gaulle was viewed, sort of
                        in the corridors of NATO at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: He was making himself highly unpopular. I may have mentioned this
                    before, but it's a theme in my career: I had gone to school in France, and I was
                    at home in the French language and culture. I did not agree with de Gaulle's
                    extreme nationalism that led him to say in 1966, shortly after I left, “You will
                    remove all American military installations and NATO headquarters from France,”
                    including the headquarters in which I was working.</p>
                <p>That sentiment was building while I was there. He refused cooperation in the
                    military aspects of NATO, although the French permanent representative, the
                    ambassador, was still there. He just didn't participate in certain aspects of
                    the military deliberations. It was quite extraordinary.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>And then there was de Gaulle's military philosophy... Do you remember the two
                    phrases that described that philosophy? One was: “D�fense � tous azimuts.” It
                    meant defending all 360 degrees of the compass. In the modern world, you had a
                    hard time keeping a straight face. The other was: maintain the force de frapp�,
                    his own nuclear force. I could not really see that that was very sensible. There
                    were a lot of differences in the French delegation on this. Socialists, for
                    example, did not agree.</p>
                <p>And then we did have a major spy scandal. I knew one of the people accused of
                    having spied for the USSR during this period. He did it, in part, because of the
                    force de frapp� and the potential for serious confrontations that could result.
                    That's written up in a recent book.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From what you were getting, how did we view the Soviet
                        threat during this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Well, this was the time of the Berlin Wall. No one questioned the need
                    to fully mobilize. I was also representative on the Committee for Information
                    and Cultural Relations (CICR) of NATO. We were trying to combat the Soviets on a
                    psychological plane. I don't think there was any question that they were using
                    every possible means to weaken us. This was the high point of their efforts to
                    penetrate by spying. Their military was really nervous. I had the feeling that
                    they were probing, although not irresponsibly. It turns out they were probably
                    conservative. But we were fairly alarmist. It was a way of life. We focused our
                    intellectual and other resources on how to confront this great danger.</p>
                <p>Now the French government, at the same time, was very shaky. There were rumors
                    about French generals in Algeria conducting a coup in Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, with paratroopers. Were you there at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was NATO responding? There were a couple of nights
                        where they expected paratroopers over the thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your vantage point, how did you see that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>NORLAND: It was alarming, there's no question about it. We listened to the news,
                    we read the papers. I can remember huge headlines saying the paras were coming.
                    There was an assassination attempt against de Gaulle; he narrowly escaped death
                    at a crossroads south of Paris. One understood what was meant by instability and
                    insecurity.</p>
                <p>This family we lived with, by the way, was almost our same age; they had the same
                    number of children, and our children got to know one another. We ended up
                    communicating on many different levels. I think one of the reasons they wanted
                    an American family was because of a sense of insecurity. One host talked about
                    being certain that his children got an American education so they would be able
                    to live abroad during an expected upheaval in France. And he was a strong
                    Gaullist. He had fought with the French resistance and made a remarkable record,
                    I'm sure. But there was a fundamental insecurity. The French were talking about
                    not being able to remain in France. We felt also that the NATO forces, which
                    were right next door to us in Rocquencourt, within a kilometer of the
                    headquarters...It was a formidable military machine, and I can't say that I ever
                    worried personally. I felt that we could always move about without concern about
                    roadblocks or whatever.</p>
                <p>We drove to Switzerland for vacations at almost every opportunity, especially at
                    Christmas. I happen to have a Swiss sister-in-law, and her parents had a pension
                    in the province of Vaud, a little village called La Praz. It was a pension, with
                    family cooking—and a great relief to be able to spend time there. You know the
                    atmosphere of Switzerland. Calm. In spite of any alarms that might be sounded
                    outside, you had a good feeling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last question about your time with NATO. What was your
                        impression of the American military there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Well, I saw General Norstad from time to time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the SHAPE...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: I believe he was head of SHAPE at the time. We interacted a little bit
                    with the military, and were in a position to see what they were doing. I never
                    really got deeply involved. I'd had my own military experience, so I was
                    sensitive to what they were trying to do. We were providing the necessary
                    leadership. I felt that the U.S. was doing a good job. One of my most frequent
                    contacts with the military was the PX. It was called Bel Manoir; again, within
                    walking distance of where we were living. And you could see the way they could
                    mobilize warehouses full of goods. That was symbolic of the abundance that we
                    brought to the effort. The U.S. didn't skimp in efforts to make it a going
                    operation. So it was quite a shock to be told, in 1966, that we would have to
                    pick up and leave.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>The point I meant to make earlier, which I think is worth reiterating, is that
                    there has been created over the years, partly as a result of our exclusion by
                    resident French officials and civilians in the colonies, by the way the French
                    treated us in NATO (the attitudes toward non-French-speakers, for example), a
                    significant anti-French feeling in the American bureaucracy. We've never really
                    been able to fully understand and to sympathize with or appreciate French
                    policies and motivations. And I feel this has been overdone. I understand, as I
                    have said, that their military policy was often ridiculous. But I do feel that
                    we have a great deal to learn from the French, especially in the Third World.
                    Not in the way that they conduct their bilateral relations, but in their
                    willingness to get to the root of an issue. They studied the culture. They
                    became anthropologists. They became adept linguists. They really did get to know
                    those areas. And in our areas of concern, we've not wanted to consult or to
                    benefit from their knowledge. This is one of the things that I find regrettable:
                    we don't get the most out of them and their experience. We rather look at them
                    as rivals. And that's not the proper approach, it seems to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you left NATO in 1963.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had, what, a tour at the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: At Montgomery, Alabama, at the Air Command and Staff College, one level
                    below the Air War College.</p>
                <p>That was revenge on the part of Personnel. I had the misfortune...I should never
                    have done it, but I was having financial difficulties in Paris, even though we
                    were living on the outskirts. I couldn't get ahead. I couldn't get a bigger car.
                    I had a little English car at the time. And I felt I ought to have a change;
                    NATO was boring. They offered me an opportunity to go to the embassy, to be
                    number three or so in the Political Section. And I felt I ought to be able to do
                    better. So I kept trying to hold out for another responsible position. I didn't
                    care where; I think I was pretty much open on that. And somebody in Personnel (I
                    think I know who it is; I've never actually broached it, and he hasn't to me)
                    said, “Well, we'll teach Don a lesson for having said no.” And so they sent me
                    to the Air Command and Staff College in Montgomery, Alabama, which was a long
                    move, for about nine months.</p>
                <p>It was kind of a dismal experience. I was one of maybe ten civilians, the only
                    State Department person, with 600 majors and lieutenant colonels, talking about
                    things which were not uninteresting, e.g. the strategy of air power, beginning
                    with Billy Mitchell, bombing of a cruiser. So we tolerated it, but it wasn't a
                    terribly instructive time.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>I learned something, and I came close to having a very good experience. I was
                    asked to come to Washington (I hitched a ride on an Air Command and Staff
                    College pilot's flight) to be interviewed by several people in Washington in
                    response to President Kennedy's desire to get a firm fix on the French in their
                    colonies: What was their aim? What were their ambitions? What was it they were
                    doing? What was their attitude toward us? It was sort of an overall survey of
                    France in Africa. I came up here and I was interviewed by Bob Good. He was the
                    head of INR. He said, “You're our man. You've had that experience.” I'd had a
                    couple of years' experience, but that was more than many others. I got on the
                    plane and went back to Montgomery. Two days later, Kennedy was assassinated so
                    they called off the whole project. But it was interesting. It would have been
                    exciting to have been able to assess the French role early on, and to answer the
                    corresponding question: What should America's role be in this part of the world?
                    JFK was willing to undertake that kind of study. Of course, President Johnson
                    came in the aftermath of the assassination.</p>
                <p>But other than that, I had a few interesting experiences. I went through the
                    flight test medical and some technical training. You get in a machine and are
                    spun around. I went up in a fighter, looped the loop and got sick. It was not a
                    highly useful year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you came out and you got, at last, to The
                        Netherlands, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Yes. The great irony, having missed it before — my predecessor in The
                    Netherlands, who'd gone there in 1961 when I was supposed to go there, was
                    transferred and I was able to replace him. But this is another assignment
                    resulting from a chance meeting in the corridors of FSI. I was at FSI studying
                    Spanish, assigned to Ecuador in a new position as “executive director” of the
                    country team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this also part of this matrix-type...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: I think so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember I was offered that job when I was in
                        Yugoslavia. They said this is a big thing. God, I looked at this and I said,
                        “Oh, my God.” My gut instinct was to stay away from that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: I know. It looked like another level of bureaucracy. But it was a chance
                    to get into another area. I felt I'd done Africa. I couldn't get an African
                    assignment. And it was a chance to learn Spanish. So I was in intensive Spanish.
                    And I happened to meet Julius Walker. You know Julius?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: I met him in the corridor one day. He was in Personnel, and he asked,
                    “What are you doing?”</p>
                <p>And I said, “I'm studying Spanish, preparing to go to Ecuador.”</p>
                <p>“To do what?”</p>
                <p>And I told him.</p>
                <p>And he said, “You don't want to do that.”</p>
                <p>I said, “That's interesting. Why not?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, let me look into it, and I'll give you a call.”</p>
                <p>Within a week, he called to say, “How about The Netherlands?”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Absolutely.”</p>
                <p>I didn't think I was giving up anything particularly important.</p>
                <p>So I went to The Netherlands instead. But it was one of those corridor
                    arrangements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '64 to '69. What were you doing
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: The first two years, I was the deputy political counselor, number two in
                    the Political Section. There I had a boss who was a true Wristonee. He sat in
                    his office, with the morning telegrams and the newspapers that he could read (he
                    didn't read Dutch) and the periodicals and the INR studies, and he read. And I
                    studied Dutch an hour every day; I don't think I missed a single day, five days
                    a week. I studied with a wonderful teacher. The Department's arrangement was:
                    You give us a half hour of your time, and we'll give you a half hour of the
                    Department's time. So I was there at eight o'clock for an hour. I later got a
                    rating of 4/4 in Dutch language.) Knowing Dutch was a way of getting out of the
                    office. I made it a point to get out and meet people. The Dutch are very
                    approachable, once you make the effort.</p>
                <p>My first year there was torture. They had an inexperienced charg�, who had
                    imperious attitudes. One notable incident: he came into a room where a colleague
                    was still sitting, and said, “When the charg� comes in, you stand up.” Now I
                    happened to be already standing. But that was an attitude that stuck in the craw
                    of a lot of people. A Wristonee.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>The political counselor was also a Wristonee, who'd had a previous assignment as
                    a labor attach� in India, but had no particular interest in NATO, or the EC, or
                    the Dutch and their culture. He was a bookworm, in a sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the reader, you might explain what a Wristonee
                        was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Someone who had been in the Department of State in a Civil Service-type
                    position, and who was told, as a result of the Wriston Report of 1953-4, that
                    you had no option; if you wanted to stay in the Department, you must make
                    yourself available for overseas duty. They were given a certain amount of time.
                    But in the shakedown of what would happen, they ended up, most of them, taking a
                    job rather than being dismissed.</p>
                <p>I'd had one of those in NATO, a man who just went around wildly, thinking that
                    this was his opportunity to make a tremendous impression with his rigid,
                    disciplined attitudes. It was a difficult experience.</p>
                <p>Anyway, a year of this in The Netherlands, while I spent my time getting
                    acquainted, learning Dutch, and then both those men were transferred. Not
                    coincidentally, by the way, because the new ambassador was Bill Tyler. And he
                    brought with him Earl Sohm. And they brought with them Cleo Noel. You know Cleo
                    Noel's name?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know Cleo. He was killed, of course, in Khartoum.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: That's right. Cleo became the boss in one of the best hierarchies that
                    you could possibly imagine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill Tyler was Mr. Europe for some time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: He had been the assistant secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Assistant Secretary for EUR.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Right. I'm told that his oral history is one of the best, and at some
                    point I would like very much to read it. I've maintained contact with him, and I
                    occasionally see him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's a fine man. I interviewed him over a period of about
                        three sessions, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>NORLAND: He is remarkable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A very, very nice man.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: He brought so much. Tremendous. I mean, he is the most erudite man I've
                    met—not in a disagreeable way, in a modest way. Excessive modesty perhaps. He is
                    a most Renaissance-like man. He had unbelievable qualifications: an ability to
                    identify key issues, his dealings with Josef Luns, the foreign minister of The
                    Netherlands, his way of managing the embassy. Earl Sohm, too, had such a
                    delicate touch. And Cleo was so good; interested in everything, and willing to
                    let me have the run of the job. He said, “Go and meet people, get acquainted
                    with the fractieyoorzitters,” the party leaders. And, of course, receptions are
                    important in The Netherlands. I could say I thought it'd be good if Bill Tyler
                    had lunch privately with one of these floor leaders. Well, I would be told to go
                    ahead, arrange it, and sit in. It was just totally different, like night and
                    day.</p>
                <p>Then Cleo got his invitation to return to Khartoum, and Earl and Bill Tyler
                    performed what is sometimes considered a minor miracle; they managed to get a
                    deputy political counselor made a political counselor. It's not easily done. So
                    I had three great years in The Hague as political counselor. And that was really
                    just a wonderful experience, marred only by the awful Vietnam issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask. The Dutch more or less parallel the
                        Swedish experience as far as our time in Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Well, except their attitude was greatly tempered by their loyalty to
                    NATO. They were torn: they did not want to do anything that would weaken NATO;
                    and they did not want to do anything that would weaken NATO's backbone, which
                    was, in a sense, the United States. So, even within the Dutch Foreign Ministry,
                    you had two quite different attitudes. You had those who said, “Look, don't be
                    tough on the Americans. We need them desperately.” And you had others who said,
                    “But the Americans are hurting themselves. They're weakening their own ability
                    to perform this role.” So you had a somewhat pacifist anti-American group in the
                    Foreign Ministry that was saying, “Let's tell them honestly how we feel. Let's
                    not just roll over and accept whatever they tell us.” It was a painful period. I
                    knew people on both sides, and I tried to be a link between them and to be
                    honest, but it was difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we having trouble with the students at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Yes.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't just the Vietnam issue; they seemed to be a
                        problem for the Dutch, too, weren't they? They seemed to be a force unto
                        themselves.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: The students were not a major force in The Hague. They were a problem in
                    Amsterdam, particularly. This was the age of drugs, LSD, and the youth culture,
                    an anti-Vietnam spirit took the form of experimentation. It was regrettable. One
                    Dutch political party formed during this time represented a sizable segment of
                    Dutch youth. It was called D-66. Have you heard of it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Democrats '66. And a young man named Hans Van Mierlo was the leader. He
                    was a casual dresser, which was not customary in The Netherlands. When you came
                    to see people, you were generally formal. He typified this new generation. They
                    presented themselves in the 1966 elections, and actually won some seats, seven
                    or eight out of 150. The atmosphere, even then, was such that a lot of people
                    didn't think it would be proper for the American ambassador to receive Hans Van
                    Mierlo. So it was arranged for them to meet in my house. Otherwise it would be
                    interpreted as being soft on our critics over Vietnam. Well, Bill Tyler agreed
                    to come and talk with him. Bill charmed him, and we had good relations from then
                    on.</p>
                <p>Peter Dankert, a young Socialist married to a Frenchwoman (who was suspected of
                    being a leftist), was Socialist spokesman on foreign policy and NATO affairs. He
                    was quite ambivalent about how firmly the Dutch Socialist Party should support
                    our NATO policy. But we remained in contact and had long discussions. It was
                    great fun.</p>
                <p>So the issue was a terrible impediment to the kind of relations that they wanted
                    and we wanted but that we couldn't have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any issues other than Vietnam that were a
                        problem either in the United Nations or dealing with the former Dutch
                        Netherlands East Indies and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Yes, there had been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But at the time you were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>NORLAND: Yes, there was a residue of that epoch. Luns never forgave Robert
                    Kennedy for having pushed the United States, especially the United Nations, into
                    forcing the Dutch out of what was New Guinea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: New Guinea, Irian.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: West Irian.</p>
                <p>But I have to mention one other thing that preoccupied me during this time, and
                    it illustrates this ambivalence in the Dutch view. NATO and its many
                    manifestations—bases, logistical areas, PXs—having been forced out of France,
                    the call went out: “Where else in Europe can we install some of these bases?”
                    The Netherlands is one of the most densely populated areas of the world, and yet
                    the Dutch came through and offered us two major bases: one, called Soesterberg,
                    where they actually put in an Air Force unit; and another base in the south,
                    called Bussum, where there was a Southern NATO Command. So, on the one hand, we
                    had fruitful discussions. I can even remember the names of the Dutch pro-NATO,
                    pro-U.S. people who said, “Well, this is more important than niggling you on
                    Vietnam.” We received, in almost record time, Dutch agreement to the bases. We
                    didn't have long, acrimonious discussions about what would be done. The Dutch
                    virtually wrote it and we signed it. We had people moving into the bases in a
                    matter of months.</p>
                <p>I thought at one time that was going to be my greatest achievement in the Foreign
                    Service, having succeeded in laying the groundwork for this rather rapid
                    acceptance of NATO bases by the Dutch. I made the initial contact and the
                    initial request. Bill Tyler followed up.</p>
                <p>But the Dutch accepted the bases despite the crowded conditions. We had a PX at
                    Soesterberg. One of the rituals of the wives was to get into the car once a week
                    and drive this harrowing autobahn some fifty miles to Soesterberg Air Base,
                    where the kids would go along because there they could find American comics,
                    American candies and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>There were other important discussions; for example, on the NPT, the
                    Nonproliferation Treaty. The Dutch wanted this very much, and they wanted to go
                    even further than we. They had real experts; one of them was Terwisscha Van
                    Scheltinga, Mr. NPT. And he was also very Dutch; he was not going to accept
                    anything unless it was clear that the “i's” had been dotted and the “t's”
                    crossed. But we talked and by '68, he was ready to go along. His desire to carry
                    this even more deeply had been appeased. And the Dutch were enthusiastic
                    supporters of the NPT.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>There were other issues where the Dutch would have taken issue with us but,
                    generally speaking, it was wonderful. If we could only have escaped Vietnam. It
                    was embarrassing. You'd bring in high-powered Americans who had just returned
                    from Vietnam and who were saying, “Give us an audience and we will convince them
                    that we are winning, that we have the situation under control, that it would be
                    wrong to give up now, that our credibility is at stake.” And, I had to sit and
                    listen to this. A couple of journalists, one of whom just died, Dries Ekker, a
                    highly responsible journalist, had a weekly column. It was all we could do to
                    hold him from making significant attacks against U.S. policy. We never convinced
                    him, but he did hold off, didn't say the worst. We saw him and his wife often;
                    they were wonderful people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it that within our embassy—you and others—there was
                        no feeling of support for the Vietnam War.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Within the embassy?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: That was a very interesting story. We had an economic counselor, my
                    counterpart, Emmerson Brown. Did you ever run into Em Brown?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I met him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: He had the guts to stand up in staff meetings and say, “This is folly.
                    This is ridiculous.” And we were all finding ways, because we didn't want to be
                    too divided between internal attitudes, where we would agree with him, and then
                    go out and say something different. I regret that I followed the American line
                    pretty regularly and told Em I was sorry I just couldn't agree with him. I
                    should have agreed with him; I should have acknowledged he was right.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, there was a breakthrough about 1968. I'd been there four years. We
                    had the visit of Clark Clifford. Clifford and Bill Tyler had known one another
                    (Bill knew everybody), and the day or so after the visit Bill took me aside and
                    said, “You know, I had a talk after dinner last night” (there were thirty people
                    or so at dinner)...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Clifford was, at that point...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Secretary of Defense.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had been brought in by Johnson.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Right. And Bill said, “Clifford told me afterward that he has the
                    greatest reservations about Vietnam, that he is working to get the United States
                    out.” Here we are, officially told that our policy is the same, yet Clifford
                    didn't believe in it. It was just a shame that we couldn't have changed policy
                    earlier. I feel I owe Em Brown apologies for having not stood up for him and
                    said, “You know, you're right, Em.” One of his arguments was: We're not paying
                    for this as we go along, which is exactly what it turned out to be a few years
                    later. But there we were. This was the problem of conscience versus duty.</p>
                <p>Then Vice President Hubert Humphrey also came to visit. He was not enthusiastic
                    about the war, but at the same time, he wasn't saying anything publicly about
                    it. Too bad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went to Stanford for a year, from '69 to '70,
                        which must have been rather difficult. What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: I was free. I was called a senior fellow. I had an office in the Hoover
                    Institution Building, and it was Hoover-sponsored. I'd been five years in The
                    Netherlands, and there was effervescence, instability in the world. I went out
                    there with the intention of studying revolution.</p>
                <p>My focus was on revolution in the student body; they were massing and
                    demonstrating. They even threw rocks through my office window. I have pictures
                    of my office window broken by student rioters. Through the provost, a man named
                    Brooks, as I recall, I asked for permission to get inside this student movement.
                    And he assigned me to a sociology professor named Sanford Dornbusch (spelled
                    just like his counterpart at MIT, Rudiger Dornbusch). He was a sociologist, and
                    he was the faculty advisor to the students against the war, SDS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Students for a Democratic Society.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Right. They were organizing large rallies in San Francisco. Students
                    from Stanford were very much a part of that movement. Sandy Dornbusch was kind
                    enough to let me sit next to him at several of the organizing meetings; I heard
                    the students, and got a chance to talk with them. My conclusions are in a paper
                    which I wrote at the time, November 1969, in which I said, “These students have
                    no foreign-policy philosophy. They are not involved in the global ideological
                    battle. They are against the war. I have had three months' exposure to them, and
                    I'm giving them up. I'm not going to pay any further attention.” So I just
                    abandoned that research and focused on theories of revolution.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it's an interesting thing. As a Foreign Service
                        officer, I think maybe you've had the same experience, that you have these
                        very ideological students around the world who get involved, and in America,
                        with this one Vietnam exception, and there, you might say, because the
                        students, in a way, were on the line, because they were being drafted. But,
                        other than that, you don't seem to get that same ideological cast. I
                        remember I was in Italy when, was it Marcuse...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Yes, Herbert Marcuse.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...died, and he was teaching at San Diego. This was
                        headline news in Italy, and it was a little blip on the radar in the United
                        States, although he was teaching there. He was a great ideologue for the
                        left. I wonder, having dealt with the students in The Netherlands and other
                        times, did you get any feel for this look of why American students don't
                        seem to have the same cast?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: It's a good question. One of the answers is that the war was an
                    overwhelming issue, and in order to cast the widest possible net of supporters,
                    they didn't put ideology at the top. They focused on opposition to the war and
                    anything that would enhance the importance of their movement. There were some
                    people, obviously, under the influence of Soviet sympathizers; but the
                    organizers were wise enough to see that it could have been a source of weakness
                    if they were seen as taken over by pro-Communists. They had a platform that was
                    so much stronger without Communist rhetoric. There was no reason for them to
                    compromise on that level. I wish I could remember the chants, the slogans that
                    they decided to write on placards and hold up while they marched—a hundred
                    thousand people on one of those occasions—and all against the war. There was
                    nothing about undermining the structure of the U.S. government or institutions;
                    strictly an antiwar emphasis. So I didn't get bothered by it.</p>
                <p>While I was there, I did come into contact with a European philosopher by the
                    name of Eric Voegelin, who was working on the third volume of a study of history
                    comparable to Toynbee's, but maybe more erudite; it may even last longer. I took
                    a seminar on revolution with him. We were reading Hanna Arndt and Lenin and
                    other thinkers. But he had a perspective on the subject of revolution that just
                    fascinated me. I did a paper on that, too. I tried to get it published in the
                    Foreign Service Journal, but it was too philosophical; it wasn't the kind of
                    thing they wanted. I called it: “Philosophy, Fantasy, and Foreign Affairs.”
                    Voegelin was extremely perceptive; I can still remember his major theses. And I
                    got to know him personally. I had tea with him and got acquainted with his
                    wife.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>Incidentally, also in our office complex was Bertram Wolfe, who authored the
                    book, “Three Who Made a Revolution,” who himself had been a Communist and had
                    interviewed Trotsky. We used to have occasions to talk and get his analysis of
                    these student movements. Of course, he pooh-poohed it. Voegelin, a student of
                    revolution, also didn't think the student movement was worth much attention.</p>
                <p>Are you interested in Voegelin?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably we'd better not.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: It's a little bit erudite. But it was a good experience.</p>
                <p>And, incidentally, my office mate there was John Negroponte, who had just come
                    out of his Vietnam experience highly frustrated, and was given a year before
                    being dispatched to Ecuador as political counselor. He had run into Henry and
                    taken issue with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about Henry Kissinger.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Right. John and I shared some enjoyable experiences. We played tennis
                    regularly. Another historian there, Berkeley Tompkins, was teaching at the
                    university. The author of “People of Plenty,” whose name escapes me right now
                    [Potter] was a wonderful historian. My wife audited his course. So we had a good
                    experience, and the study of revolution was something that I was glad to have
                    done. It helped me by enabling me to evaluate revolutionary movements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is of course one of the things that stands a
                        Foreign Service officer in good stead, because you're able to observe your
                        own country. You have to, really, to represent it abroad, to understand,
                        particularly in a time of major changing of political tides and all that, to
                        have had that experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: And to get the perspective of a European philosopher, who headed the Max
                    Weber Institute in Munich for a long time, who was extraordinarily erudite, was
                    an experience. For him Plato was a living figure. He brought such depth to it.
                    He thought in terms of cycles of one hundred years, two hundred years, instead
                    of five or ten years. It was useful. We lived on campus in student housing
                    called Escondido Village. Again, it was dominated and distorted by the Vietnam
                    War. The Cambodian bombing occurred in the spring. Awful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were mentioning there was something you wanted to add
                        about your time in Abidjan.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>NORLAND: I can't imagine that if we had done a complete record we would have
                    omitted some of the people who were there. Among them was Brandon Grove, who was
                    vice consul. The most important person in my life at the time was Marion Markle,
                    a most faithful, competent, devoted, agreeable, uncomplaining, motivated person.
                    I hate to say it, but in those days we even permitted ourselves the luxury of
                    asking people in the embassy to babysit. On one occasion she babysat for my
                    family; I think maybe all three. But, you know, we could count on her. It's
                    something I'm afraid we can no longer rely on. I would love to see her service
                    recognized. And I was very sorry that we never had occasion to serve again
                    together. She was a model person at a difficult post at a difficult time. She
                    adapted. I don't think she was ever comfortable in Abidjan, but her dedication
                    to the job was a model for all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in 1970, you went back to Africa. Had you been
                        making African noises?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Yes. And Earl Sohm was very prominent in the personnel system at the
                    time, and I had been in correspondence with him. We tried to get something other
                    than West Africa, but this was the only thing that was available. So we were
                    assigned to Conakry, Guinea.</p>
                <p>The problem at this point was that our two sons were out of elementary and at the
                    junior high level and could not accompany us. My daughter, on the other hand,
                    did come and attended an international school there. (I think there were
                    eighteen students and fourteen nationalities.) But we had to arrange for the
                    boys to go to the American School of Las Palmas, in the Canary Islands, for the
                    first year, and then to Mount Hermon, in Massachusetts, for the second year.</p>
                <p>Conakry was another example of what we've talked about. I don't know how much
                    detail you want. It was an extraordinarily demanding post, for the simple reason
                    that the president belongs on the list of tyrants of the twentieth century. That
                    is Sekou Tour�. He aspired to be a Leninist. His outer office was filled with
                    his own works, and, in addition, works by Lenin. Even though he was a Muslim and
                    did not believe in subordinating Guinea's interest to the Soviet Union in any
                    respect, he was ideologically very close to that country.</p>
                <p>An event occurred on November 22, 1970 that transformed the whole assignment. Not
                    many people remember it, namely the invasion by Portuguese naval forces and
                    commandos of the capital of Guinea, Conakry. The invasion began on the morning
                    of the 22nd. We were obliged to remain in our houses, but the shooting went on
                    during a good many hours over two days coming from the ships offshore. I saw
                    them with my own eyes; this was not imaginary. I went from looking at those
                    ships with binoculars to consulting Jane's Fighting Ships; I could identify the
                    ships as being part of the Portuguese navy. So for me there was no question
                    about this.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get to this, in the first place, you went to
                        Conakry as the deputy chief of mission. You arrived when, and what was the
                        situation when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Arrived in July of 1970. The ambassador was already there, another great
                    Foreign Service figure, Albert W. Sherer. He had come from Togo, but he had
                    spent five years before that in Poland. He was really an Eastern European
                    specialist. He'd been assigned to Czechoslovakia before that. A man of great
                    dignity and perceptiveness and a wonderful boss. I remember the first day; he
                    handed me a paper which I still have somewhere, saying, “Here's how I view the
                    relationship between the ambassador and the DCM. You will do the following
                    things; in effect, you'll run the embassy, and I will conduct high-level
                    contacts and negotiations, except where we agree that you will do it.” And it
                    was a marvelous setup.</p>
                <p>But the situation was bad even then. We'd had constant problems with suspicions
                    about Americans. This was a time of great troubles in Guinea, and the leader,
                    S�kou Tour�, was looking for a scapegoat. For example, he did not trust the
                    Germans. One of them lived next door to us, i.e. the German DCM, named Walter le
                    Walter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which Germans were these?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: These were West Germans. There were also East Germans around. They were
                    in a compound, isolated on the edge of town. Almost from the time of our
                    arrival, the West German ambassador was accused of having conspired against
                    Guinea. This was a time when the Catholic archbishop, whose name was Tchidimbo,
                    was accused of conspiring against Guinea. You had one person after another in
                    the business community accused, sometimes publicly, of being anti-Guinean. It
                    was a terrible atmosphere. The number of these cases was multiplied almost
                    indefinitely, resulting in a siege mentality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Guinea that was causing all
                        these problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: One of the problems was that the economy was going very badly; things
                    had deteriorated. And when you have a very poor economy and you are making all
                    the wrong decisions as to how to remedy it, you can no longer blame people
                    within the country; you start to blame foreigners.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>At the same time, there was some provocation from outside. S�kou Tour� had
                    allowed the PAIGC (the liberation movement for Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau;
                    PAIGC stands, in Portuguese, for the Party for Independence of Cape Verde and
                    Guinea-Bissau) to establish its headquarters on the outskirts of Conakry. The
                    Portuguese were constantly accusing Guinea of assisting the liberation movement
                    of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde, which, of course, they did. So the Portuguese
                    were undoubtedly sending in observer spies, trying to recruit Guineans, who were
                    otherwise angry at S�kou Tour� because the situation was deplorable, especially
                    the economic situation. We couldn't get food, so we organized a weekly flight
                    from Brussels, on Sabena Airlines, that was our lifeline for fresh fruits and
                    vegetables. This despite the fact the country was wealthy. It had great
                    potential, including mineral resources. There was a mountain in the north, near
                    a town called Bok�, that consisted of bauxite. The Russians had a bauxite
                    operation about seventy-five miles from the capital. The French had long
                    exploited Guinean bauxite, for forty years perhaps. The French company was
                    called Fria. Fria transformed bauxite to alumina because of the abundance of
                    hydropower. Guinea is mountainous. It has the headwaters of six major river
                    systems, including the Niger. It has climatic variations that made it agreeable.
                    We were only able to get upcountry once. But in the old days, American
                    missionaries from all of West Africa used Kankan, a city in the far eastern
                    section of Guinea, for rest and recreation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of like Simla or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Exactly. They had adequate accommodations and opportunities to recover
                    from the heat and humidity of Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso and other places.</p>
                <p>S�kou was in a mood that can only be described as paranoiac and xenophobic. He
                    was irrational. And he was trying to build momentum for his party. The more the
                    people resisted, the more he implored and cajoled them. We attended one
                    political rally after another. S�kou insisted that the diplomatic corps attend
                    most of these functions.</p>
                <p>The Chinese had built a Palais du Peuple, which seated probably twenty-five
                    hundred people. It was beautiful, very well done. It had only been inaugurated a
                    few years earlier. Whenever a high-ranking person came to town, there would be a
                    reception and a gathering at the Palais du Peuple, where S�kou would speak.</p>
                <p>From time to time this was interesting and entertaining. There would be local
                    dances, and Miriam Makeba would sing. Miriam Makeba was, at the time, married to
                    Stokely Carmichael, and they were living in Guinea. We used to attend the same
                    dinners; some people thought it useful to bring them together with Americans.
                    Stokely later changed his name to Kwame Tour�. Miriam was a delightful person.
                    Of course, her singing enchanted us all.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>But S�kou's attempt to mobilize the people by means of the party, the PDG (Parti
                    D�mocratique Guin�e) led to excesses. And one would sit in that auditorium and
                    listen to long speeches. At one point, S�kou actually made a seven-hour
                    speech—four hours with an intermission and then three more. It was the same old
                    rhetoric.</p>
                <p>I'll never forget a Swedish diplomat happened to be visiting, and saw how the
                    system operated. S�kou changed the language. You were not allowed, when you
                    picked up the telephone, to say “bonjour” or say “monsieur.” The first words you
                    had to utter were “Pret pour la r�volution” (ready for the revolution). This is
                    not imagination; it was real. Anyone could be accused of conspiring, even for
                    not answering the telephone in a certain way. It was “Pret pour la r�volution,”
                    and then talk about your business. Everybody was being monitored. The atmosphere
                    was tense, really disagreeable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were American interests in this country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Our principal interest was that ALCOA and ALCAN together with a German,
                    an Italian and a French company, had developed a consortium called the CBG
                    (Compagnie des Bauxites de Guin�e), which was going to exploit that mountain of
                    bauxite at Bok� in the north of the country. The big new operation, in addition
                    to Fria and the Russians, was to be exploited jointly with the Americans of
                    ALCOA to be the operating company. Operating personnel came from Pittsburgh. So
                    we had the challenge of helping get CBG into operation. There was a need to
                    identify a Guinean to be the front man acceptable to S�kou Tour�, and able to
                    bring the Guinea government along and make it possible for the operation to
                    succeed. The World Bank helped enormously. The Guinean ambassador to the United
                    States in the early Sixties, for five years was Karim Bangoura, described in one
                    of Dean Rusk's memoirs as being the most effective foreign ambassador in the
                    United States at the time. He helped get the World Bank loan that enabled the
                    CBG to go forward. He had completed his tour here and returned to Guinea where
                    he became minister of transport. We used to see him. But he had to discourage us
                    from coming around to see him, because of this terrible suspicion that S�kou
                    Tour� had that foreigners were recruiting Guineans as spies. In November '70,
                    Bangoura was arrested and later killed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, tell me, under these circumstances, what were you
                        and the embassy telling the ALCOA people? From what you're telling me, it
                        sounds like it was the sort of place to say, “Well, is it really worth it to
                        you to do this?”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>NORLAND: It was worth it. They felt they had the markets. They had the bauxite
                    under an arrangement that was well out of town: It was a hundred and fifty miles
                    to Bok� and the port of Kamsar, where the bauxite would be loaded. And they felt
                    that they could somehow work with the local authorities. Through a Guinean,
                    whose name was Marcel Cros, a relative of S�kou Tour�'s, they felt they could
                    somehow arrange for immunity from this terrible paranoia. And CBG didn't have
                    much interest in getting too close to us, for that reason.</p>
                <p>But we were very frank. We told them the situation was uncertain. Yet, in many
                    ways, they knew more about it than we did, because they were in daily contact
                    with the people in the north on whom they depended for so many things. And it
                    was in the interest of Guinea to make this operation go, because, as was
                    predictable, within a few years bauxite from this one plant would account for
                    about eighty-five percent of Guinea's foreign exchange.</p>
                <p>S�kou desperately wanted that revenue; he had very little else in the way of
                    support for his government.</p>
                <p>But he did have a country with resources, and if it weren't for his incredibly
                    paranoid mentality, that country could have succeeded. Many a high-ranking
                    American came, saw the country and its economic potential, its mineral
                    resources, water and land, and declared that Guinea would no doubt be one of the
                    success stories of Africa.</p>
                <p>I can give you the names of at least two assistant secretaries who came out, who
                    were terribly impressed by S�kou Tour� and who said, “This guy has found the
                    secret for erasing tribalism.” Guinea is torn by something like thirty tribes,
                    but there are three main groups. One is in the north; one in the south, from
                    which S�kou came; and then the coastal tribe. We had people who were absolutely
                    overwhelmed by this man's rhetoric. He was a brilliant orator, no question about
                    it.</p>
                <p>Then cholera broke out. We were told this was the first time cholera had broken
                    out in Africa in many years. Why? Because the level of infrastructure in the
                    city was so bad. And S�kou Tour� refused to admit that it was cholera. We had
                    the WHO people who wanted to come to Guinea to verify it, and at first he
                    wouldn't let them come in. When they came in, he wouldn't let them take their
                    equipment or findings out.</p>
                <p>It's difficult to imagine the scope of this man's political hold on the country,
                    and his paranoia. It was a never-never land.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Soviets, the East Germans, the Communist Chinese
                        playing on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>NORLAND: Yes, and they overplayed it. The Soviets had their ambassador thrown out
                    twice. They interpreted S�kou's language as meaning that they could override the
                    bureaucracy and do what they wanted to do, so he threw them out. There was that
                    element of independence in spite of this terrible atmosphere. I can't begin to
                    tell you how difficult it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it work for the embassy staff there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: We hunkered down. As a matter of fact, I came across a card the other
                    day: How to behave in a roadblock. This came after the invasion but, even
                    before, people were setting up roadblocks and shaking you down. There were areas
                    of town where you could not go, could not drive. One of the areas (just a little
                    footnote) was on the south corniche, bordering on the Atlantic, where Nkrumah
                    had been given a house...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was after he'd been...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: After he'd been deposed. Nkrumah was pronounced as the co-president of
                    Guinea at one point. Do you remember that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: He lived there, you could not go near it. If you came near it, they'd
                    shoot at your car. You'd had to detour around; it was a pain in the neck.</p>
                <p>And then the cholera. We had a medical doctor, a resident there named Dr. Jassie.
                    We didn't have an effective vaccine, so we had meetings of the whole staff; I
                    remember one in the garage, where we got everybody together, and the doctor was
                    telling people to protect themselves against cholera. “Be sure to keep clean,
                    and eat bananas.” This was his antidote to cholera. No Americans got it, but it
                    was a difficult time.</p>
                <p>We have other people who should really be interviewed before they forget. One of
                    them is Johnny Young, who was our administrative officer, a young officer at the
                    time. He's now the head of Personnel. He came back from Sierra Leone about six,
                    eight months ago, where he'd been ambassador. But Johnny and Angie Young were
                    there, and they suffered along with all of us. Some others did not want to stay.
                    Bud Sherer sent a telegram to the Department saying, “Because of conditions
                    here, I've got to make this offer that anyone who wants to leave will be allowed
                    to leave.” And we had one person who left.</p>
                <p>Macomber (M) was furious. He said, “You're not the personnel system out there.
                    You've got to go through us. We can't allow this to happen.”</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>Bud Sherer stood up and said, “Look, we don't want anybody out here at this time
                    who is not willing to endure this thing with us.”</p>
                <p>Because of steady leadership like Bud Sherer's morale wasn't too bad.</p>
                <p>Every time you had a Guinean contact, though, you had this feeling that you might
                    be hurting the person you were talking to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were running the embassy, but obviously you were
                        taking over from him, and you had the political officer or economic officer.
                        How did you operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: We would certainly not go out and make random contacts. We would almost
                    always go through the established procedure, which was go to Protocol, register,
                    and then be actually accompanied, in many cases, by the Protocol Office to the
                    person that you wanted to see. And we conducted our business in a very official
                    way, very much like the Soviet Union during those years.</p>
                <p>The economic officer was a guy, now retired, named Ollie Jones (E.O. Jones); he
                    lives up in Dover, Mass. He spent much of his time covering the port. I remember
                    he used to get out there and talk to people coming off ships, wanting to see the
                    town or whatever, and he would find out why they were there. He would follow the
                    bauxite operation through the offices of CBG in Conakry. Just sort of taking
                    what you could. It was not well organized reporting of the kind you would
                    want.</p>
                <p>And we had the Agency (CIA) there. They had quite a lot to do. In addition to the
                    countries you just mentioned, there were diplomats from Czechoslovakia and
                    Bulgaria. It was the Czechs or East Germans, one of the two, who succeeded in
                    planting a small listening device in a drawer of the desk in the ambassador's
                    office. There was an apartment house about 50 feet from the ambassador's office
                    window which triggered the device.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about fifty feet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: They had a way of activating the listening device in the drawer of his
                    desk from that apartment house which they'd rented. I don't know how public the
                    story is; I've seen it in security briefings. But it provides an example of the
                    atmosphere and the work of many of the East Bloc countries. We were not allowed
                    to talk to the Russians, even though they had a compound just a few hundred
                    yards from the ambassador's residence. We could see them on the beach, like us,
                    until the 22nd of November.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, this was about five months after you had
                        arrived.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had anything led up to this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: It came as a surprise to us. And that's not an unimportant part of the
                    story; the shooting first erupted one morning. We telephoned around and asked
                    what was going on. Miraculously, the phone system, or the internal radio system,
                    worked throughout. Everyone was asked to stay home. Bud Sherer telephoned to
                    Washington and we got a few reports out. But we just hunkered down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was this all about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: On the one hand, it was about the efforts of the Portuguese to destroy
                    the headquarters of the PAIGC. A second objective was to use some dissident
                    Guineans that the Portuguese had recruited and attack the largest prison, which
                    was right on the water's edge, called Camp Boiro. The goal was to release some
                    Guinean opposition who had been imprisoned there by S�kou Tour�. Part of the
                    evidence is that they burned one of S�kou's residences just a quarter of a mile
                    from where we lived, on the north edge of town.</p>
                <p>But there are some mysteries. I would love to do a story about the Portuguese
                    invasion. Nobody has ever taken much time to look into it. It's a historical
                    footnote nobody pays attention to. But for us it was a very important...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did it play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: The invaders came and spent probably about eighteen hours in Conakry.
                    S�kou mobilized what he could in the way of military opposition. His luck was
                    such that he was not in that residence on the edge of town. The invaders
                    succeeded in releasing some prisoners and rowed them out to the ships. They
                    attacked the old radio station. They missed the new one. Their intelligence was
                    defective; they didn't know where key officials lived. There were a few
                    skirmishes. The invaders returned to their ships and sailed away. And then all
                    hell broke loose.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you mention about the headquarters of this...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>NORLAND: Yes, they hit the PAIGC headquarters, but didn't destroy it. They didn't
                    capture PAIGC leaders, one of whom was Amilcar Cabral. He was a real hero,
                    someone that I was able to talk to on the fringes of receptions. I was not
                    allowed to meet with him officially because he represented a liberation movement
                    we didn't recognize. The only thing the Portuguese destroyed was this large
                    presidential residence.</p>
                <p>The most important consequence was to confirm the paranoia of S�kou Tour�. Life
                    was difficult up to then; thereafter it became almost impossible.</p>
                <p>I might recall some of the things that occurred during and after the invasion.
                    For example, we had Peace Corps volunteers. The one American casualty was a
                    Peace Corps volunteer who was driving back along the beach road just after the
                    invasion began. He was stopped at a roadblock by the Portuguese. Our
                    understanding was that he was about to be released when Guineans defenders
                    apparently tried to contest the roadblock. Our PCV (Scott) got caught in cross
                    fire and was wounded. This caused quite a stir, as you can imagine. We had a
                    medical doctor to care for him, and then he was evacuated. Within days, all the
                    Peace Corps volunteers were gone. We didn't have an AID operation resident at
                    the time. Then the roadblocks were set up.</p>
                <p>And they also instituted something which I'm sure that people will never really
                    believe, and that's why people like Johnny Young and others ought to be
                    interviewed so they can attest to what I'm going to say. They stationed soldiers
                    about every hundred yards on the beach. This was the Atlantic Ocean. And they
                    would not allow anyone to walk on the beach. So, for the remainder of our tour,
                    with few exceptions, we'd not feel safe to walk out from our house to the beach.
                    We would not dare to go out on the rocks near the water.</p>
                <p>We were not allowed to travel in the interior. I made one trip out of town, to
                    Kankan, and one trip to a waterfalls. Other than that, we were forced to remain
                    within the city limits of Conakry from November 22, 1970, until I left in about
                    August of 1972. We flew out for R&amp;R, in the summer of 1971. Other than that,
                    it was virtually a prison.</p>
                <p>What made it tolerable was that the Department was soon able to see that we were
                    not able to operate, to do anything. We were confined to our quarters, confined
                    to the city. All our actions were suspect. We had roadblocks everywhere.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, Bud Sherer had a very good friend as Director General, who said,
                    “We're obviously not making use of your talents. We'll develop a plan here where
                    we will use your talents”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John Burns, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>NORLAND: No, actually it was another officer whose name will come to me. But he
                    said, “We need an ambassador to Czechoslovakia. We will bring you (Sherer) back
                    and make it appear as though it is dissatisfaction with the way we're being
                    treated. The Guineans will never know the difference.”</p>
                <p>David Newsom, then assistant secretary of state for African affairs, came to
                    Abidjan for a conference. I was sent to Abidjan, that's another time I got out
                    of the country. I was asked to explain the plan. He was not in favor of it. I
                    don't know why. David was basically conservative, as you know. I'm sure you've
                    talked with him at length.</p>
                <p>But the Department eventually approved. And the result was that Bud Sherer said
                    goodbye to S�kou Tour� and left in early 1971. He slipped out, spent some time
                    in the Department, and went on to Czechoslovakia.</p>
                <p>I was made charg� d'affaires. To emphasize how much a “charg�" I was, I was
                    authorized later to move into the residence. I stayed there almost a year, which
                    made my year there a lot more comfortable. We were living in what was known as
                    the paillote, an enlarged thatched hut. It was a Frenchman's idea of how to
                    adapt local architecture for modern needs. Instead of a hut twenty feet across,
                    it's a hundred feet across. But you have the same conical roof and the same
                    thatch. That was where the DCM normally lived, so we were glad for the
                    opportunity to live in the residence.</p>
                <p>We cut staff to a total of eight Americans and hunkered down.</p>
                <p>By early '72, the Guineans were suffering deeply; some say there was a threat of
                    starvation. And Guineans came to us and said, “Look, we'd like to have
                    resumption of PL 480 food.” I remember I didn't even ask for instructions. I
                    went to see the Minister in question and said, “Did I really hear you correctly?
                    You are asking the country which, according to your newspaper, is imperialist,
                    neocolonialist, subtly attempting to subvert your government, you're asking the
                    U.S. government to give you food aid? I cannot believe it.” And the Minister
                    (named Keita) was obviously taken aback. He started the government line. “It is
                    not the government that's saying those things. We don't believe them. That
                    propaganda is not the government's view.”</p>
                <p>This was kind of a breakthrough. They realized they were in such desperate
                    straits that they had to change policy</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why couldn't the Soviets...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>NORLAND: Because the Soviets were not themselves able to offer grain or come up
                    with the resources needed. That's a logical question, and I'm sure that we
                    probably even alluded to it at the time. I can't remember ever putting the
                    Soviets forward; that would have been contrary to our basic instincts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we really interested?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: The answer is we were still fighting the Cold War. Believe me, this was
                    an active arena of the Cold War confrontation in Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who gave a damn, really?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Well, Cold Warriors were wholly in charge of the U.S. government. Henry
                    Kissinger was the national security advisor. And we had one Cold Warrior after
                    another come through. The CIA was interested in what we were doing. They had two
                    people there. We had a specialist who came out because the Guineans actually
                    went to the trouble of developing disinformation. They claimed they had a
                    telegram implicating the U.S. in anti-Guinean propaganda. I can remember the
                    handwriting specialist saying, “This was put together by the Soviets.” We had
                    some things going. The East Germans were active. Bloc countries were active.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at it with not an awful lot of perspective, you
                        kind of wonder what was all the fuss about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Well, here's the global strategic view of the time: that the Soviets
                    were using a base at Conakry for refueling their surveillance air missions over
                    the South Atlantic. Guinea became a pawn in the Cold War. And one of the real
                    achievements of Bill Harrop, was to get S�kou Tour� to have Russian use of
                    Conakry for refueling those flights. We're only sixteen or seventeen years from
                    this, but you have to recreate the mentality of the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we extracting any concessions from the Guineans as
                        far as our living conditions there? “We'd like to be able to travel around;
                        don't do this to us.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: We were fighting at the time to get reciprocal restraints imposed on
                    Guineans, in this country. And we didn't. That was one of the things that made
                    us mad. I remember being very angry about the failure of Kissinger to press for
                    what we thought would be a natural counter-action.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't until the Reagan administration that we
                        really...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: That we implemented certain reciprocal actions that made it seem that we
                    meant what we said. Meanwhile, we sat out there. The instructions from
                    Washington were: “Don't do anything that will create a stir. There is only one
                    person and only one agenda that is to get any publicity—Henry Kissinger's.” I
                    got that from many people. Remain low key; don't do anything or say anything
                    publicly even if it's anti-Tour�.</p>
                <p>When I had occasion to meet with Tour�, introduce visitors and so forth, I held
                    our ground. This is one of my most pleasing moments, i.e. standing up to him. I
                    understood when he would say, “Your country has been a part of this conspiracy,”
                    I would say, “Mr. President, I can assure you that is not true.” And he would
                    say, “But you are in NATO, Portugal is in NATO, and their ships were out there.
                    How could you not know?” And I said, “I don't accept that there was a failure of
                    communications if that's what you're suggesting. I can assure you that this
                    embassy was not aware.” That's all we could say, because it was true. “Maybe
                    somebody in NATO knew where those ships were but not Embassy Conakry.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't think anybody probably paid any attention to the
                        Portuguese navy anyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Navy people pay attention to ship movements generally. How those ships
                    could have slipped out of Portugal to Guinea-Bissau, waited there, and then
                    launched this operation, how they could have done this without any of our spy
                    operations detecting it, I don't know. But we did not know. We never convinced
                    S�kou of this.</p>
                <p>So we sat there, and we waited them out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were seeing S�kou Tour� personally. Was he a madman?
                        How was he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: He was an obsessed man. He was a man who demanded total obedience. It
                    was unbelievable. He would treat everybody in his entourage in a way that left
                    them frightened.</p>
                <p>One example came during these so-called party congresses, when he would make a
                    speech. The tradition was when Tour� arrived you'd stand and applaud. Not
                    applaud calmly, but vigorously. There were confirmed reports that after about
                    eight or nine minutes of applause, one of the ministers in the front row
                    appeared to stop and sit down before any of the others. He was dismissed. There
                    are reports that he was killed as a result.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>Another occasion, school children were being bussed to school. The buses detoured
                    because three people were hanging by their necks from the bridge in the center
                    of town. And one of them was a woman, by the way. Rather intimidating, you might
                    say.</p>
                <p>Frankly, I didn't think Tour� would dare move against us, partly because of Bok�,
                    but also because I felt I could see through him. When you meet some people
                    you're sure they're acting. Self-important is the idiom in French, the way they
                    move, the way they talk, this commanding personal attitude that says, “I'm in
                    charge; I know everything; I'm omniscient and what I say is gospel.” And then he
                    would tell stories that were unbelievable. Unbelievable. One, about having been
                    in an aircraft, falling without a parachute in a tree and being saved. He talked
                    as if he believed it. You'd listen; you couldn't take it that seriously. This
                    pompous, incredibly arrogant behavior reflected real weaknesses and great
                    pretensions.</p>
                <p>Later on, by the way, I had an opportunity (this is maybe new) to confirm my
                    impressions. His vice president Saitordage Diallo, who was from the north and
                    was a wonderful gentleman, had contracted TB. He could not get the needed
                    treatment in Guinea, so he asked us, and we said we would be glad to treat him.
                    He came to our dispensary, and Dr. Jassie treated him. I served as interpreter,
                    I greeted him when he drove into the dispensary, and escorted him out. He did
                    this from time to time so I got to know Diallo quite well.</p>
                <p>When I left the country in 1972 and came back to Washington, I found the vice
                    president was at NIH, getting treatment for his TB. Partly for personal reasons,
                    because I liked him and I wanted to show an interest, and since I was living in
                    Bethesda, I visited him. After about my second visit, with the nurses out of the
                    room, he said, “You know, I'm ashamed.”</p>
                <p>I said, “What would cause you to be ashamed?”</p>
                <p>And he said, “My country, with all of its resources, having been brought to this
                    level by that man Tour�.”</p>
                <p>And yet, all the time that he was in Guinea, Diallo was standing up next to
                    Tour�. This was confirmation. Even Tour�'s right-hand man saw him as
                    paranoid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did S�kou Tour� end his time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>NORLAND: He had a heart attack in 1984, in April. It's true that he began making
                    sounds about changing policies. He came to this country in the early Eighties,
                    for example, was received by the president, and had a meeting with David
                    Rockefeller and a group of American businessmen. The thought was that Americans
                    might consider investing in Guinea if they could be convinced that S�kou had
                    changed his stripes. He was slow to change, but he had to. He was looking to
                    this country for help, as well as to the outside world, much less to the Soviet
                    Union. But Tour� had a heart attack. He was flown to Cleveland in April of 1984,
                    and he died (I understand) in Cleveland.</p>
                <p>At that moment, you had two great political rivalries develop between those who
                    wanted somehow to maintain the S�kou Tour� regime and those who were absolutely
                    bound and determined to get rid of it. And that's still playing out. You still
                    have people who say, “Well, you know, he gave us pride, and he gave us standing,
                    and he said no to de Gaulle in 1958.”</p>
                <p>A year and a half ago, I asked for my papers from this 1970 to '73 period. I have
                    an African historian who wants to do a biography of S�kou Tour�.</p>
                <p>But Guinea had an effect on my perceptions. Fortunately (I mean it) I had had
                    that course on revolution at Stanford. I saw the megalomania, the paranoia, the
                    xenophobia. There was not really intellectual command of world realities. It's
                    shameful that Africa should have been burdened by people like that. He was just
                    as bad, in his own way, as Stalin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Nkrumah? Did he play any part, or was he just
                        given a house?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: He was given a house.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And co-presidency.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: That's right. By this time, he was ill with cancer. I saw him on several
                    occasions sitting at meetings without being given the chance to say a word,
                    possibly because he was too weak. He died while I was there. We were all invited
                    to participate in a symposium on Nkrumah at the Palais du Peuple.</p>

                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>NORLAND: I was the American representative. They say that there's a film that
                    S�kou made of this, and that I'm shown talking a bit about Nkrumah. I had put
                    together a proposed statement and sent it to the Department. The reply was, “No,
                    we don't want to say anything. Cut it way back; just do a paragraph of the usual
                    thing.” Nkrumah died while in Romania receiving medical treatment. He was buried
                    in Guinea, and re-buried recently in Ghana.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Not really, just that we kept going. The people who held out, those
                    eight, including Johnny Young and Madeleine Byron, and others, managed to
                    survive and developed esprit de corps. Great people.</p>

                <p>NORLAND: Fair enough.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is March 24, 1993, continuing with Don Norland. Don,
                        we got you out of Conakry, and so we've got you, in 1973, coming back to the
                        Department. I wonder if you could tell me what you were up to? I think you
                        got a sort of bipolar assignment when you came back, from '73 to '75.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Actually, I came back in the summer of '72, to the Political/Military
                    Affairs Bureau. In retrospect, I suppose it was useful because the head of the
                    bureau was Ron Spiers and the deputy was Tom Pickering. My immediate boss was
                    Chris Chapman, who had the unenviable task of doing a lot of what I found, after
                    having had considerable responsibility in Conakry, to be fairly mundane and
                    frankly boring. It was not a great period for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, what were you and your colleagues doing in
                        Political/Military? How did it interact? I assume that every regional bureau
                        really felt they had most of the action.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>NORLAND: Military Assistance and Sales was the office within the P/M Bureau to
                    which I was assigned, and it pretty much was described in the title. We had a
                    staff of about eight people, divided regionally. The individual officers were
                    arranging military assistance programs to various countries. In some cases, they
                    were grants; in other cases, they were sales. It was pretty routine, tedious. My
                    particular job, for much of the time, was to monitor compliance with the
                    Fulbright amendment to the Military Sales Act, which specified that countries
                    receiving American aid would have to pay the equivalent of ten percent of the
                    value of that aid into a fund which we would be able to use. My job was
                    literally to go around and identify the delinquent countries that had not paid
                    the ten percent, to follow up. It was one of the most boring jobs you can
                    imagine. Talk about political work—there was almost nothing there.</p>
                <p>One reason we had a relatively quiet tenure was because Spiers and Pickering were
                    almost totally preoccupied with helping pave the way for South Vietnam to
                    receive all the military assistance that we could muster anywhere in the world.
                    And that whole story has been told too many times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just one question before we leave that. Was there any
                        questioning by anyone that you were dealing with (you were the new boy on
                        the block and all this) about what we were doing pumping these arms all over
                        the place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Beyond the fact that it helped our balance of payments and
                        made the military feel happy because of savings in quantity and all that

                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: It was so bad that there developed a little esprit de corps among that
                    group of officers who were assigned there. We had to laugh behind their backs.
                    During that time, for example, I saw a copy of the letter that President Nixon
                    sent to the Shah of Iran, saying, in effect, you can have anything you want from
                    our arsenal.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the most horrendous thing, really.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: You've heard of it, I'm sure. And I knew, from that moment on, that this
                    was a wild operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was anything filtering back, saying what are we going to
                        do with all this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>NORLAND: I don't think anything officially filtered back; I think there were some
                    unofficial questions raised.</p>
                <p>Remember, Henry Kissinger was national security advisor at this time, and people
                    were quite aware of the fact that, to question something like this in a memo,
                    was to put your head on the chopping block. I've never been in a Department that
                    was quite as intimidated as that Department of State was during the Kissinger
                    era. And it became worse when he became secretary of state in '73. People were
                    so hypnotized by the Communist threat that even something as egregious as
                    supporting a questionable head of a country, like the Shah, went almost
                    unquestioned. I remember when they geared up to send Agnew over for the two
                    thousandth anniversary of the Persian empire.</p>
                <p>This was all out. Behind their backs, we were saying this is out of control. But
                    we were not courageous, I have to say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you moved over to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: I got word there would be an opportunity to go into Personnel. I didn't
                    know much about it, but I had a chance. I was given a very warm welcome by
                    people like Bob Stevenson, who was my chief there. I took over the job of
                    helping to develop career training and career assignment paths for political
                    officers at the O-3 level, what used to be O-3. And those people are in the top
                    slots today. I got well acquainted in the Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the old ranks, the O-3 was essentially the colonel
                        level.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: That's right; it's FS-1 now. So it was an interesting assignment. I had
                    good people working with me; Sam Bartlett, a wonderful guy; several others, who
                    don't have to be named, I'm sure. And it was at this time that I ran into my old
                    friend Earl Sohm. He had been the DCM in The Netherlands and was one of the
                    smoothest managers that the Department has ever had, absolutely no rough edges
                    with that man. He was very good, and he was, by that time, working for Larry
                    Eagleburger as the deputy in M.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Management.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>NORLAND: That's right. In the summer of '75, Earl came to me and said, “Larry is
                    determined to make more efficient the business of managing the Department of
                    State.” Funding allocations, up until that time, were made by a couple of people
                    with green eyeshades, sitting in the basement of the Department. It's hard to
                    believe, Stu, because this was only eighteen years ago, but the idea of linking
                    management resources and policy objectives was still almost unknown. Larry, to
                    his credit, said, “We're going to elevate this process. We're going to expose it
                    to the light of day. We're going to bring it to the seventh floor.”</p>
                <p>So, in the summer of '75, I was brought in to be Earl Sohm's deputy and the first
                    head of what they called the Policy Priorities Group (PPG). That was an
                    interesting managerial exercise. I participated in the business of asking the
                    parties most directly concerned...that is to say, assistant secretaries
                    competing for additional funding, to defend their requests. They competed for
                    funds arguing their needs out at Larry Eagleburger's conference table. My job
                    for a time was to summarize the issues—what the EUR Bureau or the Africa Bureau,
                    or the inspector general wanted—and to lay out the key factors. They were
                    discussed, under Eagleburger's chairmanship. There would be a vote by members of
                    the Policy Priorities Group. They included the inspector general, the director
                    general, four or five other ranking people from within the Department. I've
                    never had a better opportunity to observe Department management.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume that this also made everybody really decide what
                        they were doing. Rather than just going ahead as we've always done, they had
                        to work on their own priorities. It must have been a sort of
                        revolution.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: And those who were the most qualified, those who were the best equipped
                    to explain and to justify their requests, to provide strong reasons for it, were
                    the ones generally who got the funding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you do me a favor? I ask this question once in a
                        while when it seems appropriate, and this is, could you give me, from this
                        perspective, a little ranking of how you found the various bureaus as far as
                        their ability to work within the system and make the...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Sure. The EUR Bureau was usually outstanding. They always seemed to have
                    not only the most talent, but the most focus. Art Hartman was then assistant
                    secretary. But he had deputies, and his EUR/EX people were good. He always
                    usually had a strong case to present. He stated it, low key, very well.</p>
                <p>Other bureaus were not always well focused. The Africa Bureau, for example, was
                    so diverse. To make a convincing case on an integrated, continent-wide basis for
                    one particular post opening or one additional allocation of resources as against
                    another, was more difficult. People didn't know the area. It was very
                    difficult.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>I don't have a clear impression of the Asian Bureau.</p>
                <p>Latin America was not particularly strong at that time. They had a feisty guy
                    (I'll give you his name afterward, because he's around and I know he's still
                    very good) who was very articulate, very persuasive, but abrasive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was it? It's not going to hurt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Bob Sayre. Do you know Bob?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I don't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: He could sometimes damage his own case. So personalities were very
                    important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're really talking about diplomacy and everything else.
                        Were you aware of maybe NEA and EA or something going off in a corner and
                        saying, “You scratch my back; I'll scratch yours.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: It wouldn't have done much good, because in the final analysis, if the
                    issue was significant, they had to lay it out on the table there.</p>
                <p>I was amazed that Eagleburger was the person in the annals of the Department, who
                    really brought modern management changes of significance. I have to give him
                    credit.</p>
                <p>He also did another thing, which you could find the records on. He brought in
                    management specialists on consultation. I was asked, in some cases, to identify
                    top people in that field. I'd call to the Society for American Public
                    Administration and find out who the big names were in bureaucratic management.
                    One was from MIT, another from San Diego State. They would be brought in about
                    once every three months for a little lunch on the eighth floor. Eagleburger
                    would come in for about twenty minutes and then be called away. But the rest of
                    us, Earl and one or two others, a small group, five or six people, would sit
                    around and pick the brains of this specialist, asking, in effect, what he
                    thought should be done.</p>
                <p>So there was a semblance of trying to modernize the Department. That process has
                    only been slightly changed until recent years when it again became personalized.
                    If the secretary wanted it, the secretary got it. From what I understand, that's
                    the way it was under Baker, for example. Eagleburger really introduced a
                    democratic process.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But Kissinger was secretary of state during part of this
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that people were trying end runs, going to
                        the secretary? Or was Eagleburger, being close to Kissinger, able to stop
                        some of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: It was often through Eagleburger that they were trying to make the end
                    runs. Larry was very loyal, but he was one of those who would stand up to Henry.
                    I happened to have just finished reading the Kissinger biography by Isaacson,
                    and the stories in there reflect my own experience. Once Eagleburger was sitting
                    in a meeting, and the white phone rings. He picked it up, listened, slapped it
                    down, and said, “Henry's just instructed me to fire the entire front office.”
                    Read that book by Isaacson and you'll see this occurred repeatedly. I remember
                    him sitting around one day. Larry was in a thoughtful mood, and somebody said,
                    “Okay, Larry, what do you do in cases like that?”</p>
                <p>Larry said, “You wait till morning, and then you feel out the situation, and
                    probably end up not making any changes at all.”</p>
                <p>He was an important figure. I was in awe of someone who would stand up like that
                    in the face of temper tantrums. Henry could be brutal; he demoralized the
                    Service, as you know, except for those few people who could stand him.</p>
                <p>It was a great management experience. I think I've learned how to manage better
                    as a result.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, again, you were watching this. Did you find that
                        there were FSOs who responded to this and other ones who just weren't able
                        to work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Absolutely. For some, the idea was a new one, that they had to strongly
                    defend claims on resources. Money in turn translated into people, buildings and
                    equipment. For some, to ask for resources was beneath them. They didn't
                    understand that this was a negotiating process, a debate, a discussion that had
                    as its outcome a real result. You'd do a memorandum of the decision, and Larry
                    would be pretty good about seeing it was carried out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask a question, because I came up basically through
                        consular ranks, and earlier on, about five or six years before this, all of
                        a sudden the consular people started to put it together in what they called,
                        I think, the packet or something like this, of really putting out what
                        demands there were in the growth and all this, so that they were able to
                        respond quantitatively when everybody else was sort of flying around. Did
                        you find them effective in that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>NORLAND: I'm sure that a lot of the movement toward quantification of
                    requirements stems from this period where people just wouldn't go along with
                    general requests. To say, “We need this;” or the “host government has asked us
                    for this;” or “our business community says they need it.” You get into
                    specifics: How many requests do you have? What specific benefits will this
                    bring? Can you compare this to some other requirements? A lot of what we do, of
                    course, is in contrast to the consular function, which is a highly quantifiable
                    function.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a demand.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: It's a demand and a right people have. But from some commercial
                    services, it's hard to quantify. There were a lot of seat-of-the-pants judgments
                    here. But Larry had a good understanding of the Service, and he really did
                    rationalize management and strengthened certain aspects of it. I'm sure you've
                    heard of the control over Personnel that we had in those days. Did you ever hear
                    of Glynn Mays?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: I wish I could think of the name of the computer operation that he ran.
                    It contained the names of every American overseas.</p>
                <p>The rule then was that the ambassador had to approve any increase in staff. That
                    authority was taken away under the Reagan administration. Why? To make room for
                    more defense attach�s and more CIA. It was a mistake. They're talking about
                    reinstating it now.</p>
                <p>It was an effective management tool; Glynn would be there to provide the
                    quantitative data on how many people were at a certain post, and whether an
                    increase appeared justified. You lose control if you don't have a centralized
                    personnel roster.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been an exhilarating time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: It was demanding. I can remember spending weekends and nights assessing
                    the papers that I'd be given by each of the bureaus as to why they wanted
                    additional resources. Larry said, “Don't ever talk more than three or four
                    minutes; point up the differences and the specific decision the PPG has got to
                    make. The question before you is: Should you respond favorably to this or that
                    request, or can you somehow reconcile the two and split the difference?</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>And, it was thanks to that that I got to know Larry Eagleburger. And it is no
                    mystery in this business that if you don't have that kind of patron, it's hard
                    to be made ambassador. If you want an explanation of how I got to Botswana,
                    Lesotho, and Swaziland (the BLS countries), in 1976, it lies in this
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did it come about, then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Well, four years in the Department is considered appropriate. Earl, my
                    dear friend, was sensitized to the fact that I had been in Washington four
                    years. And through his smooth workings, he would nudge Eagleburger and say, “You
                    know, Don has been back here almost four years. I know he's only been here for a
                    year and a half, but he's done his work here.” And Larry was really very
                    generous in his performance evaluations where he was the reviewing officer. He
                    agreed with Earl that the time had come. And my name went up for one Embassy in
                    the summer of 1976. I was close to getting a mission, but they decided, for
                    reasons of balance within the Service, that an administrative officer should get
                    that post. Meanwhile, I had talked with Bill Schaufele, then the assistant
                    secretary in AF. Art Wortzel, who was prominent in the personnel system, was
                    important in helping me. The BLS countries came up, Larry approved my
                    nomination, and I got the assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You served there as ambassador from '76 to '79.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Three years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were American interests there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: That's really the question. American interests at that time were much as
                    they are now; but we were not attuned to what was going on in that part of the
                    world. It is just amazing to think that just fifteen years ago we had no
                    hesitation in sending out one person to three countries, all bordering on South
                    Africa. All reflected, in one degree or another, what was going on in South
                    Africa. And our contacts among South African blacks were not good. Contacts
                    endangered blacks. I've had people tell me that Botswana reflected the most
                    accurate source of black public opinion in Southern Africa. As a result of the
                    Soweto riots of June 1976, we had probably a thousand hard-core
                    black-nationalists in Botswana, which was only two hundred and fifty miles
                    northwest of Johannesburg. The riots in Johannesburg were such that it was very
                    uncomfortable for many blacks to stay on. Schools were closed. So we were able
                    to monitor what was going on there, to test reactions and attitudes of these
                    black nationalists, black-liberation-movement representatives.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went out there in '76, which was still Kissinger and
                        all. And then came the Carter administration. Now did you see a major
                        change? Kissinger was renowned for having no real interest in Africa except
                        to see it in an East-West context; you know, Angola or something like that,
                        but only as a reflection of our antipathy towards the Soviet Union.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: It was a position that he maintained until April of 1976. He was on a
                    tour of the area and, from what I've heard from insiders, was getting ready to
                    go to Lusaka, capital of Zambia, to give another speech reflecting the policy
                    that South Africa's monopoly on modern, organized military force in this part of
                    the world meant it would remain in charge for the foreseeable future. At least
                    to the end of the century. So we had to work with South Africa; together we were
                    going to confront the onslaught of Communism. I hope someday you'll get the
                    people like Win Lord to give the background. I read the...biography very
                    carefully on this, and it's not clear. But Win Lord apparently got to Henry and
                    said, “You can't give this speech any longer. The forces represented by the
                    black nationalist movements are forces we should be sympathetic to. They are
                    taking much of their rhetoric and much of their philosophy from our own
                    experience; that is to say, human rights, civil rights, the right of
                    self-determination, and so forth.” So in April of '76, Henry's speech changed a
                    little bit. It was nuance, but he did change; he did say that South Africa was
                    going to have to come to terms with events in the world. As I recall, that was
                    the main thrust. But it wasn't more than a little opening.</p>
                <p>At that time it was absolutely forbidden for our officials to have official
                    contact with the ANC (African National Congress), the largest of those groups.
                    And the non-ANC black groups were so small they were mere splinters.</p>
                <p>We in Gaborone didn't know the refugees were ANC. We just knew that they were
                    blacks from South Africa, and so we contacted them.</p>
                <p>It was depressing to hear what they believed and what they thought were the major
                    forces at work in the world, and specifically in South Africa. There was strong
                    pro-Communist ideology. You'd look at the books these people had in their
                    refugee quarters (and I visited some of them, in so-called refugee houses, on
                    the outskirts of town). They'd have a half dozen books; three or four of them
                    would be Lenin, Marx, Castro, or Guevara. We had a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were under tight reins then, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Yes. It was considered provocative to South Africa if we had meetings
                    with the ANC. So people would meet informally, the ANC had a big office in
                    Lusaka, for example. Mutual friends would invite ANC and Americans to the same
                    party, and you'd interact. The CIA got special dispensation. I've never been
                    impressed by their knowledge in this area. But some of our people had made an
                    effort to really get to know the languages and the people, and they would have
                    sustained contacts—but never official.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>This was only broken in January of 1987, when Secretary Shultz received Oliver
                    Tambo in the Department of State. That's ten years later. Unbelievable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went out, did you get any instructions about what
                        you were to do and what you weren't to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: [chuckle] That's a fun question. The country director at the time was
                    Frank Wisner. I put in a request, through Frank, to pay the customary call on
                    Secretary Kissinger before going out. Frank came back and said that it was not
                    necessary to make a call, and that the Secretary only had a couple of things he
                    wanted me to keep in mind. The first was, we don't need any new ideas from the
                    field. We have all the information and all the initiatives we need back here.
                    Secondly, keep a low profile. We do not need any diversion. Maybe Frank
                    extrapolated a bit, but the spirit of the Kissinger era was: There is one focus
                    of public attention, and that is the Secretary. A couple of other things came up
                    along the same line. I wrote them down at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you ever find them, we can put it in. In a way, it may
                        be true that you don't want too much initiative, but you don't tell people
                        this too much, because it does things... Sometimes the situation can get
                        dangerous, anywhere, and...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Well, that gives me a chance to say that, late in January 1977, after
                    Carter took over, someone whom I had met, Dick Moose...no, he didn't take over
                    immediately, somebody else was the Assistant Secretary. Maybe it was Schaufele
                    still; maybe Schaufele continued. But, anyway, Moose was the person who was
                    already starting to eye Africa. He was in M. He had not found a home there, and
                    went into Africa affairs. The point was that within days after Carter's
                    inauguration, I got a telegram in Botswana asking, “Please submit your ideas on
                    what it is that you think the United States should be doing in Southern Africa
                    at this time.”</p>
                <p>I've often used this in talking with junior Foreign Service officers, to make the
                    point that they should always be prepared. You can have people like Henry
                    Kissinger and other know-it-alls who are there temporarily. The most important
                    thing one can do is to prepare for the day that you get an opportunity to say
                    what you think should be said.</p>
                <p>I had been thinking about this, knowing that Henry was not going to be there for
                    long, the election having changed the leadership. So I was able to come in with
                    some suggestions. In fact, I came in with some suggestions before the 20th of
                    January 1977. And that rankled Henry greatly.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>I'll tell you what it was. It was an attempt to contain the sudden interest of
                    the government of Botswana, a Third World government, only eight hundred
                    thousand people, in arms. They had a tremendously challenging social agenda;
                    they needed to put people to work. But the pressures were mounting in the
                    country, on the president, Sir Seretse Khama, from the three violent struggles
                    going on on its borders: the struggle in Zimbabwe, between the British regime
                    and the nationalist forces, Nkomo and Mugabe; the struggle in South Africa,
                    which was forcing refugees over the border; and the struggle in Namibia. Poor
                    Seretse Khama, one of the brilliant leaders of the Third World, an Oxford
                    graduate, did not want to put the resources of the country into buying arms and
                    aircraft. Yet he was being pressured by his own son, Ian Khama, then a brigadier
                    general, to acquire this arsenal. Why? Because Botswana people were living on
                    these borders, or close to the border—Gaborone itself is only ten miles from the
                    South African border—and sensed the dangers of South African raids. Same thing
                    in Zimbabwe (it was then Rhodesia), where the white military were raiding. So,
                    to protect his population, Khama was being pressed to acquire arms.</p>
                <p>When I got there, it was the first thing he raised in the presentation of
                    credentials. We became good friends. He would take this up with me informally as
                    well as formally. He didn't want to arm; we talked about ways of lessening the
                    pressure. The most important pressure at the time was from Rhodesia.</p>
                <p>My recommendation to the Department (the unsolicited one while Henry was still
                    there) was to send a signal through South Africa to the authorities in Rhodesia
                    that their actions in violating the border were forcing Seretse Khama to acquire
                    an arsenal, that the United States might not be willing to provide that arsenal,
                    and therefore where would he turn? To the other side.</p>
                <p>I felt I had to say, “Let's prevent this arms race from expanding in this part of
                    the world when there are so many other more important priorities of an economic
                    and social nature that should be met. Let's preserve Seretse Khama's desire to
                    keep Botswana from even having a Ministry of Defense.” They had police force,
                    but not a defense establishment.</p>
                <p>The first thing I knew, a deputy assistant secretary traveling in the area came
                    up to see me, and said, “Your initiative was not at all appreciated. You
                    shouldn't have gotten involved. What are you trying to do?” Of course, it was
                    perfectly obvious what I was trying to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: And then, when the 20th of January '77 struck, the idea was welcomed and
                    got consideration.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>Unfortunately, we were slow to react one way or the other. We weren't going to
                    give them the arms. We weren't going to facilitate the acquisition of arms. We
                    tried to talk them out of it. But eventually we had to help out a little bit.
                    The British helped out. And they did turn to the Soviet Union eventually.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it we didn't have any particular commercial or
                        business interests in Botswana.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: We had an indirect interest. American Metals Climax of Connecticut had a
                    partial interest in a copper/nickel operation near Selebi-Pikwe, which is
                    halfway to Zambia. That was one investment. We'd actually helped to build a
                    road, the Botzam Highway (Botswana-Zambia Highway), a gravel job. We had
                    indirect interests even in the diamond business. But, of course, the monopoly on
                    diamond mining was De Beers, which had its relationship with the government of
                    Botswana. We had an interest in exploring possibilities, for example, of coal.
                    Shell, which is not U.S., but British and Dutch, was operating there. Some of
                    our companies came out to take a look at the minerals potential. But, you're
                    right, we didn't have much of an interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lesotho and Swaziland, I take it, were really too small
                        to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: In Lesotho, there's almost nothing in the way of resources. Swaziland
                    has got a lot of resources, but the U.S. was not in there; it was South African
                    dominated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had three countries, how did you play this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: I was under pressure from particularly Lesotho and Swaziland to spend
                    more time there. My predecessor, David Bolen, did not like Lesotho and
                    apparently did not conceal his lack of interest. He was not comfortable in
                    Swaziland. So he spent most of his time in Botswana. When I got out there, it
                    was in my interest—almost a duty—to try to level this relationship. So I
                    established the practice of spending a week every month in Lesotho, one week a
                    month in Swaziland, and two weeks a month in Gaborone. I'd vary it slightly. But
                    when I was asked where I was resident, I always said, “In this country,” because
                    the Department had residences available in all three. While I was not there they
                    served as housing for TDY communicators or others. But I regularly made the
                    tour. I visited Lesotho some thirty-three times in thirty-six months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the housekeeping, how did this work? Your main
                        administrative stuff was in Botswana?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>NORLAND: The main political activity was in Botswana. But in each of the
                    countries, we had a resident mission; that is to say, there would be about an
                    O-3 DCM, plus a communicator and an administrative officer. We also had AID
                    missions and a USIS operation in all of the countries. When I first got out
                    there, as a matter of fact, the AID mission was centralized in Swaziland as the
                    most agreeable of the three places in which to live. And there was a kind of a
                    division of labor that had been informally developed there. But each of the
                    three posts had a basic infrastructure of personnel and of resources—vehicles
                    and so forth. When I was not there, a charg� was.</p>
                <p>You could call the bluff of these various countries, particularly Lesotho and
                    Swaziland, by saying, “I am here for the week. But even if I'm not here, if you
                    will simply inform the embassy of your interest, I will be glad to come back at
                    any time, for any meeting of importance; don't worry about that. Stay in touch.”
                    And, of course, they didn't have much important business with us. Only on one
                    occasion was I asked to go to Swaziland on short notice.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, the Department also was kind in authorizing the use of light
                    planes. The embassy in Pretoria had an air attach� aircraft. And they liked to
                    fly over the region to get better acquainted, taking pictures. They eventually
                    got into trouble, as you may remember, and the aircraft, the air attach� and all
                    were thrown out.</p>
                <p>The trip was two hours door to door. I would leave one embassy, hop in the plane,
                    and I could be at work in another embassy in two hours. Each was almost exactly
                    four hundred and fifteen miles apart, the three capitals—Gaborone, Mbabane,
                    Maseru—you can see them on your map, almost a triangle crossing South Africa. My
                    wife didn't particularly enjoy flying, and she'd often want to do some shopping,
                    so she would take the car and chauffeur, stop in some South African towns en
                    route before rejoining me. Meanwhile, I'd already done a day's work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did any initiatives come out of the Carter administration,
                        from your perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Yes, some of them important. One can hardly exaggerate the importance of
                    the Botswana example in human rights and democratization, something the Carter
                    administration pursued vigorously. At one point, Pat Derian, assistant secretary
                    for human rights and humanitarian affairs, had in mind making a major speech in
                    Gaborone to say just what I said; mainly, that Botswana had paved the way.</p>
                <p>I'm proud of the fact that from the moment I arrived and tested the theory of
                    Botswana as a democracy, Botswana stood apart. I tested it going to Parliament,
                    talking with members of the opposition, and asking, “Do you have freedom to
                    speak? Do you fear intimidation? Do you have an independent press? If you make a
                    public speech that's contrary to what the president says, do you have any fear
                    whatsoever?”</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>And the response was, “No.”</p>
                <p>I became confident that Botswana was a democracy—with freedom of expression,
                    movement, religion, and so forth—and that their elections were meaningful, not
                    perfect, but meaningful. And it was rooted in a traditional system called the
                    Kgotla, which means “village council.” Sir Seretse Khama insisted that his
                    ministers campaign between elections, as well as at election time, and explain
                    what the issues were. Even though the people might not always be literate, they
                    had ideas. And there is a tradition in Botswana that says, “A chief is a chief
                    by the will of the people.” That's the foundation of democracy.</p>
                <p>This tradition helped set Botswana apart. I couldn't say quite the same about
                    Lesotho or Swaziland. The Botswana experience was the one I stressed, saying
                    this is something we ought to build on.</p>
                <p>And the Carter administration (you were asking about initiatives). They weren't
                    inspired by just the Botswana example, but they did make something of human
                    rights. I think they were encouraged by Botswana's success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the other two countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Both are monarchies.</p>
                <p>During my time in Lesotho, the country was run by the prime minister, Leabua
                    Jonathan. I often call him a Chicago ward politician. He kept saying, for
                    example, how important it was that I spend more time in Lesotho. And I'd ask,
                    “What for? We are giving you more aid than you can usefully use. What do you
                    want me to do?” He came to power by annulling an election, in 1970, seizing
                    power. He wouldn't let go until he was deposed by a military group in 1980.</p>
                <p>In Swaziland, there are two separate governments. The monarchy (in my day,
                    Sobhuza II), with a clique of advisors strongly traditional in their actions and
                    attitudes. They hovered around the king down in the valley. Up in the capital,
                    Mbabane, you had a Western government, people in dark suits, etc. The king wore
                    leopard skins, very often. When I presented credentials, he had a feather in his
                    hair, and was in leopard skin. That's where power resided. When you went to the
                    capital, you had these men in three-piece suits but with little power.</p>
                <p>We have some officers who can tell you in great detail about Swaziland, Jim
                    Wachob, for example. Do you know Jim?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I don't.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>NORLAND: I'll ask Jim to come in. No one made a more concerted effort to
                    penetrate Swazi society than Jim Wachob. And yet he will tell you to this day
                    that he had great difficulty.</p>
                <p>I went regularly because we had work to do. There were missionaries. We had to
                    reiterate the importance of treating refugees from South Africa correctly,
                    through the UNHCR (United Nations High Commission for Refugees) or bilaterally.
                    The Swazis had special detention camps in the hills. Of course, it's a beautiful
                    country. The economy is evenly divided between agriculture and industry—South
                    African dominated, of course. They have, I think, one of the largest tree
                    growing operations in the world, a great source of wood pulp. They have some
                    mining: coal, asbestos, which is not very popular.</p>
                <p>So I made the rounds as best I could, using a combination of activism and
                    dialogue. I would always be seen calling on people, even if I knew I wasn't
                    going to get much in the way of results. It was part of showing the flag, so
                    they couldn't say, “Well, you're in Gaborone. You're spending all your time in
                    Botswana.”</p>
                <p>But Botswana had these three wars requiring more attention, more reporting. But I
                    had a good deputy in Botswana, too. Frank Alberti was there for much of the
                    time. Do you know Frank?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I know Frank.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: He had this tragedy, during that time, when his wife, on her way back
                    from Johannesburg for medical appointments, had an automobile accident and was
                    killed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I didn't know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: She's buried there. And one son was seriously injured, but he apparently
                    has returned to health.</p>
                <p>Frank would do a great job of filling in for me while I was there, seeing the
                    president if necessary. I didn't feel threatened if charg�s were seeing the
                    ranking people. It was all in a good cause.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your relationship with the South African
                        authorities in these various places?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Well, they were not welcome in these places. There was no official South
                    African mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really? In none of them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: None. There were South African businessmen, South African spies, South
                    African domination of the police force, as in Swaziland. They were functionaries
                    behind the scenes. You'd have a sign that said: “Mr. Dlamini” (the most common
                    name in Swaziland; almost everybody is a Dlamini); but behind the scenes was a
                    South African.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your relations with our embassy in Pretoria,
                        Cape Town?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: They were not always as smooth as could have been expected, they were
                    naturally apprehensive that we might be having contact with ANC people. If the
                    South African government found out about such contacts it would protest: “Why
                    are your colleagues in Gaborone having contacts with these black terrorists?” So
                    we were discreet, trying to minimize the problems for our colleagues.</p>
                <p>We had our own interests. And we thought what we were doing was more in harmony
                    with the overall U.S. policy objectives—namely, to encourage democratization,
                    freedom of movement and expression, voting rights, that sort of thing. We didn't
                    think we should be inhibited by always deferring to the South African
                    government. After all, they were on the wrong side of these issues.</p>
                <p>We had a lot of sentiment to overcome; for a long time, the American government
                    was in bed with the South African government. We had various ambassadors out
                    there, many of them political appointees, who felt that our future was with
                    South Africa. Until very late, Kissinger felt that our future was with South
                    Africa. He had such bad judgment on these issues. He really thought power was
                    measured principally, if not exclusively, by force of arms, ignoring the ideas
                    that have produced revolution around the world. And he still is a little slow to
                    recognize those virtues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there three years, doing your rounds and all
                        this. Then you moved to a real hot spot, didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Yes. For the record, I have to say that we had an inspection, in
                    mid-'79. The head of the team was a friend of mine, who said, “Looking at this
                    issue of whether we should have separate ambassadors to all three countries,
                    rather than this multiple accreditation, what do you think?”</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>My reply was, “If those assignments will go to career people, so that we can, in
                    effect, give the experience to younger officers at the O-3 level...” We had done
                    this before; we had had O-3 ambassadors in Rwanda...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the Persian Gulf...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: In various places. “If we can use these posts as a training ground for
                    young ambassadors, give them a chance to show that they can manage, that they
                    can direct and coordinate programs, it would on balance, be a good thing.”
                    Bernie Stokes was in Lesotho. Why not name Bernie or his successor as
                    ambassador, give him the title? The same with Jim Wachob in Swaziland. They were
                    mature people; they were in their fifties, experienced. They could have done it.
                    “But,” I said, “if this should turn out to be a training ground for political
                    ambassadors, then it would be an unfortunate development.”</p>
                <p>I got assurances that said, “Don't worry. We think you're right; it's a good
                    thing to show that these countries have come of age. Probably on balance, it
                    wouldn't be any more expensive, and it may be even less expensive, to do it this
                    way (name separate ambassadors).”</p>
                <p>So I agreed. Two of the three countries were immediately given to political
                    appointees, which cost the U.S. taxpayer enormously. Why? Because instead of
                    having a relatively junior deputy—if Jim Wachob had been ambassador, for
                    example, his deputy could have been a junior officer—we had to upgrade the
                    deputy and move in somebody more experienced, at great expense to the U.S.
                    government.</p>
                <p>In the case of Swaziland, I'm pretty sure that this is true, a man came into the
                    Department and asked where the Swiss Desk was. He thought he was going to
                    Switzerland. He did not know the difference between Switzerland and
                    Swaziland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, God.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: I suppose I couldn't have held out; after all, we're talking about only
                    a little over a decade ago that you'd see an article on Southern Africa every
                    two months in the U.S. press. And after Soweto, interest subsided again.
                    Southern Africa was way off the scope of most Americans. That could have
                    continued; on the other hand, I don't think it was fair not to prepare for the
                    day that these countries were acknowledged as countries.</p>
                <p>To be sure, Lesotho is surrounded by South Africa; whether that's a viable
                    independent country is open to question. They've even begun to ask themselves
                    whether they might not be integrated into a democratic South Africa, as probably
                    will be the case in the next decade.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>Swaziland, on the other hand, is likely to remain independent. I don't want to
                    leave the impression that it will be easy in Swaziland, because they also have a
                    monarchical tradition.</p>
                <p>The king of Lesotho has his own ideas, but he's virtually exiled now. He exiled
                    himself in some respects. Moshoeshoe is his name, a younger man, probably
                    forty-five.</p>
                <p>The current king of Swaziland is Makhosetive Mswati III, born in 1968, represents
                    a long tradition, and you can't obliterate monarchical tradition.</p>
                <p>Having spent three years in the BLS countries, and having gotten the final year's
                    extension on the strength that I'd been working hard and I'd made a lot of
                    contacts and was building up programs, as the third year approached, they said,
                    “You've had three good years, now we're going to put you through the mill.” And
                    I didn't protest when they assigned me to Chad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was sort of a bureau appointment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Yes. I don't think anyone was competing to go to Chad. We hadn't had an
                    ambassador there for six months or so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our interests in Chad, and what was the
                        situation? We're talking about 1979 to '80, when you were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: That's right. In 1979, our interests in Chad could be quickly
                    summarized: Chad was Libya's neighbor, and Qadhafi was having a field day. He
                    had been relatively successful economically in his own country, and was trying
                    to do things to elevate himself to a position of importance in the world
                    generally. He was a player in Middle Eastern affairs.</p>
                <p>I maintain that the most understandable explanation of why Chad became important
                    was Qadhafi's strategic goal of a Pan-African Islamic Community (PAIC). This
                    theory has often been reported and I've never seen it refuted. There are other
                    explanations but I contend that the PAIC explains much of what Qadhafi does.
                    It's mystical and unreal. But he believes he has a role in uniting the
                    Arab-speaking people of that region. And, of course, the region extends all
                    across the Sahel. Qadhafi wouldn't stop at Chad or Niger. He's supported
                    dissident movements in other countries as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Messed in The Sudan.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>NORLAND: He has never failed to take an interest in The Sudan and messed it up as
                    you say. He tried to help the north conquer the south, which antagonized the
                    south and, in effect, exacerbated Sudan's civil war. But he's also helped
                    dissident movements as far away as Senegal, or Mauritania and Gambia. Clearly,
                    his fingerprints are on an attempt to overthrow the government of Gambia. It's
                    hard to believe, but one is forced to take Qadhafi seriously.</p>
                <p>And he has tremendous resources due to petroleum. The story of Occidental Oil is
                    shocking. I'm sure you know it because we've got experts, like Jim Akins, who
                    can tell you all about that. I've said, “Libya with its average per capita
                    income of something like $7,000 is Chad's neighbor and has an average per capita
                    income of something like $250. That disparity makes unrest and instability
                    almost automatic.</p>
                <p>For example, Qadhafi has supported every one of Chad's thirteen political
                    parties, in one way or another. Whether they were from the south (which is to
                    say, antagonistic to him), or Arabic-speaking in the north, he supported them in
                    his efforts to destabilize the country and expand his influence.</p>
                <p>Libya is a huge territory, but with only about three million people. Chad, the
                    fifth-largest country on the continent, has some five million people, all but a
                    couple hundred thousand in the south, where you have rivers and arable land. It
                    was called le Chad utile, or the useful part of Chad. (That contrasts with the
                    north, which was considered to be the useless part of Chad.) There was a dispute
                    with Libya over the so-called Aozou strip, a band of about sixty miles wide
                    along the frontier between Libya and Chad. Qadhafi thought he had the right to
                    claim that territory, and legal disputes arose over its status. There were
                    rumors it contained uranium.</p>
                <p>Another interest in Chad was petroleum. When I arrived, there was a CONOCO
                    operation centered about seventy-five miles northwest of the capital of
                    N'Djamena. They had found oil and were ready to pump it. They had plans for a
                    pipeline to take it to the outskirts of N'Djamena, where they were planning a
                    mini-refinery. The production would be enough for Chad's internal needs. That
                    would have been a tremendous gain for the country, not to have to buy petroleum
                    products abroad. This was also a very important factor because it was an
                    American company. (CONOCO was not just American; they had a French dimension to
                    that whole operation.)</p>
                <p>Other than the Libyan interest and this small American commercial interest, there
                    was little to hold our attention in Chad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during the end of the Carter term. Did we
                        see this as a battleground between East and West?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Oh, yes. During the Carter years, I'll have to say that interest was not
                    great. We were preoccupied by other events.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>I can give an example. On the 7th of November 1979, the Iranians took American
                    hostages at our embassy in Tehran. That sensitized people to a whole new set of
                    issues in the Middle East, including the influence of Khomeini and what we now
                    call Islamic fundamentalism. We were in a sensitive position in N'Djamena,
                    because Sudan was next door, and Sudan had become a minor ideological
                    battleground. We were closely associated with Gaafar Nimeiri, the president of
                    Sudan. Our aid reached some two-hundred-and-fifty-million-dollars in the early
                    '80s. That's a tremendous investment. We threatened to lose that investment if
                    Qadhafi gained influence and there was talk about his outflanking Sudan. There
                    were other strategic considerations. The Carter administration was on the
                    defensive due to events in Tehran, so we were lying low.</p>
                <p>Those events had their repercussions, the most important of which came in March
                    of 1980. Hissen Habr� was the minister of defense in the government of President
                    Goukouni, a person of limited experience and education. Habr� had three degrees
                    from French universities; he was chafing at the idea that he was subordinate to
                    this barely “literate” man from the north. So Habr� took up arms against
                    Goukouni on March 20, 1980; fighting began in the streets of the N'Djamena,
                    being the capital and the only infrastructure worth fighting about.</p>
                <p>We holed up, and at the end of three days, we were urged to get out of there. The
                    Department was afraid (I've been told subsequently) we might become the second
                    group of American diplomats held hostage by unfriendly forces. The French still
                    had about eight hundred soldiers stationed at the airfield on the outskirts of
                    N'Djamena. They also had an effective emergency evacuation plan. After three
                    days of shelling we were encouraged by radio (we had voice radio to Ghana) to
                    get out of there. By this time a dozen people were camped in the residence. Late
                    on one afternoon we got into cars and drove through the streets.</p>
                <p>I have a copy of an article that my wife did that described that evacuation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you'll give it to me, I'll make a copy of it and put it
                        with your interview.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: I'll be glad to do that.</p>
                <p>We got out with no casualties. Very fortunate, because there was a lot of
                    fighting going on. The city was in flames. Thanks to the French, we got to the
                    airfield. And the next day, I was flown out on a French Trans-All to Douala,
                    Cameroon, with my wife and three or four other embassy people. The French had
                    things well organized, they could offer you the option of flying out or driving
                    out. They had put a temporary bridge across the Logone River, a couple of miles
                    from the city. So the defense attach� took the official car and drove out to
                    Cameroon, where he used the car for many months.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>We got out, and that changed things. This becomes of some interest because the
                    government that we left behind was still headed by Goukouni. He called on the
                    French military, in May 1980 (it was March when we left), to withdraw, saying
                    their presence disrupted efforts to reach a negotiated settlement. Hissen Habr�
                    was still in the country in the south part of town. In June 1980, this same
                    Goukouni turned to the Libyans and asked them for military assistance to help
                    drive Habr� out of the country. And they succeeded in driving Habr� out in the
                    fall of 1980.</p>
                <p>By that time, we saw the Reagan administration coming. And the Reagan
                    administration looked at this array of forces, and saw Goukouni, still the
                    legitimate president, and remembered that he had called on Qadhafi to bail him
                    out. And the Reagan regime decided to find an alternative to Goukouni.</p>
                <p>This was an interesting “contra” movement.</p>
                <p>But the point is that Goukouni, by the fall of '81, saw change building. The OAU
                    (Organization of African Unity) people, as well as other outside influences, got
                    to Goukouni and said, “Look, you're creating a serious confrontation with
                    various countries, including the United States and France, by allowing Qadhafi
                    to have this influence.” Libyan forces were actually occupying as far south as
                    N'Djamena. They were almost co-responsible for government in N'Djamena, the
                    capital.</p>
                <p>I could provide further details on this, but the fact is that in late October of
                    1981, with Habr� driven out of the capital thanks to the cooperation of the
                    Libyans, Goukouni turned to Qadhafi and said, “You have completed the mission
                    for which I requested your assistance in June of 1980. Now please leave.” And
                    Qadhafi left. Within two weeks, all Libyan forces were gone from Chad. Those
                    forces had already become very unpopular, because, like any military occupying
                    force, they act arrogantly and made themselves very unpopular. And they
                    left.</p>
                <p>By this time, however, the United States had decided to help Habr� return to
                    Chad. He had taken refuge in Cameroon with about half of his military (we
                    estimate maybe two or three thousand people) and in western Sudan where he was
                    poised on the border. And about this time, American aid started to flow, the
                    result of a Casey decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's William Casey of the CIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: The CIA was deeply involved in the whole operation. Habr� was getting
                    assistance directly and indirectly, i.e., the U.S. was replacing military
                    equipment that the Sudanese and the Egyptians turned over to Habr�. We were, in
                    effect, filling in behind these parties that we enlisted to support Habr�.</p>

                <p>NORLAND: Right, and this is the key point. This was the beginning of a contra
                    operation, and it's the only successful one of the Reagan administration.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Chad government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: I arrived there just weeks after the first coalition government had been
                    negotiated. It had been announced in August of 1979, thanks to the initiatives
                    of the French. I was the last ambassador to deal directly with these parties:
                    the president, Goukouni Oueddei; the minister of defense, Hissen Habr�; the vice
                    president, Mr. Abdul Krden Kamougi; and the coalition. I was able to assess the
                    strengths and weaknesses of these parties. And throughout the time that I was in
                    the Department I was asked by Dick Moose, the assistant secretary, to monitor
                    what was going on in Chad. So I kept fairly close tabs on what was happening,
                    making recommendations, etc. I actually went to countries bordering on Chad, on
                    a couple of occasions. I followed it very closely. And then, when the new
                    administration came in...</p>

                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>NORLAND: The Reagan administration and Crocker came in. I was alert to the
                    underhanded scheming. I asked what the new administration intended to do, and I
                    was giving them my best advice. As a matter of fact, I have here some notes that
                    I made at the time, and I thought I might quote from them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, would you quote, please.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: This is February 7, 1981, for a meeting with Assistant Secretary
                    Crocker. The issue that I wanted to discuss was the support that was brewing for
                    Habr� as the “preferred faction.” And I made a note to myself: “In my
                    contributions, I have set forth pros and cons, always concluding that Habr� is
                    the least desirable anti-Libyan faction.” I did agree that if the diplomatic
                    options failed, we might return to Habr�, but that, for the time being, he was
                    not popular and we should not support him. And I gave various reasons. I refer
                    to the recurring references to support for Habr� as the preferred priority, by
                    the Reagan administration. Under the heading of Aiding Anti-Libyan Factions I
                    wrote: “I feel strongly that helping Habr� should be viewed as the least
                    desirable expedient, one that should be undertaken only after the diplomatic
                    option has been given at least several weeks to work itself out. There are two
                    principal reasons. First, Habr� is the one prominent politician who has no
                    political future in Chad.”</p>
                <p>I should add that Habr�'s movement was unpopular because he had committed
                    atrocities in the south in 1979, and was known for that. He could not travel in
                    the country south of the capital because his forces were detested. Habr� was a
                    guerrilla fighter, an excellent guerrilla fighter, but he was not a politician.
                    He had no sense of compromise. He was an aristocrat. Incidentally, he came into
                    power in Chad on the 10th of June 1982; he was thrown out on the 3rd of December
                    1990. When I heard that he had been thrown out, I understood why and had, in
                    effect, anticipated it. Habr� could not govern except by brute force, and thus
                    antagonized many people.</p>
                <p>I tried to keep the Reagan administration from putting its eggs in the Habr�
                    basket. I didn't succeed. And that's one of the reasons that I retired. I felt
                    that I didn't want to be associated with this.</p>
                <p>It was a misguided decision that cost the United States a total of perhaps a
                    half-billion dollars to put Habr� into power and keep him there for eight years.
                    And the costs are still coming in. We took responsibility for several hundred
                    Libyans whom we're still supporting somewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a huge operation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: It was expensive. We brought in AWACS, because Libya...</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: AWACS being the Airborne Warning and Control System.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Airborne radar, exactly. Libya did provoke Chadians by sending its
                    forces in the direction of N'Djamena, on several occasions. But it was the
                    French who were called upon by the authorities, even Habr�, to return with the
                    necessary armed force (including air forces) to repel the Libyans. Habr� did a
                    good job in turning back those forces as well. In '87, for example, he conducted
                    a daring raid to the north, across the border, and destroyed a lot of Libyan war
                    materiel. That was daring; it was great...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to finish up on this, could you tell a little about
                        your experiences at the time of the fighting there, what happened and
                        all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Well, I'd be happy to talk about that. It was challenging.</p>
                <p>I had contact with all three of the major political factions. I had made a point
                    of calling on the Imam, the head of the mosque of N'Djamena, a huge
                    establishment. The Saudis put in something like ten million dollars, twenty
                    years ago, to build a really magnificent mosque. And when the fighting loomed in
                    March 1980, when it appeared that there was going to be an outbreak of fighting,
                    I made the rounds or telephoned to these factions. I went to see the Imam.
                    Because I didn't speak Arabic well enough, I took a local employee as
                    interpreter. I was trying to warn them all that for a country struggling for
                    survival (because Chad really was in very bad shape economically), it was folly
                    for whatever reason to allow their country to become an arena of armed
                    competition. They had developed certain qualities of tolerance but from the time
                    of independence in 1960, there had been terrible mistakes made. Now that the
                    Front for the National Liberation of Chad (FROLINAT) had taken control of the
                    country, a new government had won the day, and it was time to focus on economic
                    development. This was my line to everybody who would listen.</p>
                <p>One of the specific arguments that I used at every step was to point out that
                    this little oil well was close to operation in the north. The World Bank loan
                    would make possible the pipeline and the mini-refinery hinged provided they
                    could reach some kind of a peaceful agreement. But this would not go forward if
                    there was continued fighting. No one would want to invest, no one would be able
                    to work. That was one of the points I kept raising in the dialogue that preceded
                    the final outbreak of fighting: that you don't have the luxury of fighting out
                    your differences; you have to compromise.</p>
                <p>Goukouni had willingly made one concession. In the agreement that brought him to
                    power, the agreement of August 1979, he said, “I agree to have elections in
                    eighteen months.”</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>That was a fair arrangement. Why couldn't Habr� have waited for those elections?
                    Why did he have to take to the streets?</p>
                <p>One of the reasons, I'm sure (in addition to the psychological reason that he
                    just could not bear, with all of his education, to be under the domination of
                    what he called this “illiterate” from the north), was that he was getting
                    psychological support from the United States.</p>
                <p>We can understand this only by using a great deal of imagination. What made the
                    United States think that this little arena of Cold War competition was so
                    important that we should actually depose the country's president? A president I
                    was accredited to. He was also the president with more legitimacy than any other
                    political figure because he had been brought to power by political dialogue.</p>

                <p>NORLAND: No, not before the outbreak...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But at the time of the outbreak, what happened at the
                        embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: We closed up the embassy on, I think it was, a Thursday evening, fully
                    expecting to go back to work on Friday morning. The fighting broke out about
                    four in the morning.</p>
                <p>The military attach�, Jim Herrick, lived close by. He was sensible enough to rush
                    down to the embassy and get out a vehicle parked in front of the embassy and
                    brought it back to the residence. He reported something was going on. We
                    shouldn't even try to open the offices.</p>
                <p>We had a radio system and had practiced our E&amp;E (emergency and evacuation)
                    procedures. We got on the radio and ordered everyone to, “Stand fast, stay where
                    they are. No movement.”</p>
                <p>We had a couple of people who couldn't bear to just sit and listen, and tried to
                    go out in the streets. Fighting came close and they retreated. Then the warring
                    parties started shooting off Stalin organs, as they're called.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. rockets, cartouches.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Exactly. The rockets hit one of the houses next to one of our embassy
                    employees. They panicked and came without incident, to the residence. We
                    gradually picked up more and more people, who took shelter in the residence.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>Jim Bullington, deputy chief of mission at the time, was a radio ham. In
                    addition, we had a pretty good single-side-band radio. We started communicating
                    by radio, because we couldn't get to the embassy. Telephones didn't work for
                    long distance calls. So we established a kind of a radio post upstairs in the
                    residence.</p>
                <p>Because the shooting came very close by, we started to develop a “defense
                    perimeter” within the residence, bringing mattresses under a stairwell, and
                    putting the mattresses in positions whereby shrapnel might be embedded.</p>
                <p>Then Habr�, in whose area we were sitting, in what I'm sure was a conscious move,
                    brought a Stalin-organ operation into our backyard. Rockets would shoot off
                    toward Goukouni's forces about a mile north; of course, Goukouni answered, and
                    so we had a couple of shells land in the garden, not far from Habr�'s Stalin
                    organ. As long as Habr� had that arm there, he no doubt thought it would give
                    him some kind of immunity, i.e. being near the American ambassador's residence.
                    We knew Goukouni was poorly organized, that his forces were not sharpshooters
                    and not able to hit his target so we had to take special precautions.</p>
                <p>Then it became a waiting game. Loud noises that would go on almost all hours of
                    the night. There'd usually be a lull between midnight and four-thirty or so. It
                    was an awful sound. Have you ever heard a Stalin organ?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I never have.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: It's a loud whoosh. And that got on people's nerves. I have to say that
                    nobody panicked. We waited, we communicated with the Department. And we received
                    urgent messages: “Get out. Don't waste any time.” We had to call back and say,
                    “Look, the streets are not passable.” The Chadians had a wonderful cathedral
                    built entirely of wood. The cathedral was torched. It was located on the square
                    next to the embassy. We knew what was going on. Wooden stadium benches had been
                    torched. And so you couldn't drive downtown; there were electric wires all over
                    the town. We just had to sit there. It's a helpless feeling.</p>
                <p>But we managed to hold out. We communicated with the French, who said, “We're
                    trying to get a cease-fire. We'll let you know. Be prepared to leave. Develop
                    your strategy.”</p>
                <p>One of the strategies, for example, was to get broom handles and tie sheets on
                    them, so when the time came, we could hold these out the window as a white flag,
                    a sign we were neutral. We had not taken sides; we were very careful to observe
                    neutrality, not allowing any Habr� people into our compound, trying to reassure
                    all parties.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>And I was on the phone (I have notes from this period, fifteen or twenty phone
                    calls that I made notes on) to these various parties: to Habr�, to Goukouni, to
                    the Imam, to Kamouge. I was shouting into the phone, which fortunately worked
                    right up to the last, saying, “You're destroying your country. This is
                    irresponsible. You're going to lose every promising economic development
                    project, including the hope of exploiting your oil reserves, which are your
                    future.” And I used every argument I could think of.</p>
                <p>Of course, they replied with sounds that were not at all encouraging. I feared
                    for the worst. They weren't returning phone calls later on. Habr� was eager to
                    get into this battle; he thought he could take over.</p>
                <p>This had started on Friday morning. By Sunday afternoon, we got word from the
                    French that they expected a cease-fire, that the parties were exhausted, and
                    that we should be ready to move at any time.</p>
                <p>We had three vehicles in our courtyard at this point. We had our brooms and
                    sheets ready. We made a little initial dash out at one point. A couple of people
                    got out and started to get in the car when a bullet winged the rim of the wheel,
                    and knocked it off. We thought, “God, if that had hit the tire, we'd have had a
                    flat tire.” We returned to the residence, then came back about thirty minutes
                    later.</p>
                <p>We got word still that a convoy of French civilians would be coming by our gate
                    in about fifteen minutes. Everybody was authorized to take one suitcase. The
                    French had said they wouldn't accept more than one bag on the aircraft or at the
                    evacuation center. So we all had a bag. Five people, I guess, in the car, and we
                    took our place in the convoy of vehicles. There were probably fifteen cars,
                    French interspersed with some other nationalities. And we drove slowly through
                    town, with this wreckage all around—it was awful—including, of course, our own
                    embassy, which had taken a couple of miserable hits, the facade crashed in.</p>
                <p>We had the misfortune of not being able to burn everything at the embassy. We
                    also had the misfortune of having had an exercise where we had burned down to
                    the prescribed thirty-minutes' burn, but our Agency friends had not carried out
                    their part of it. So we had a lingering problem for several months as a result
                    of concern as to what might have been captured in the way of documentation. We
                    feared that Goukouni might have made the information available to the Libyans.
                    And so we did have a festering problem there for a while, but we couldn't do
                    anything about it.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>If the Agency had been honest... They had two very incompetent people there at
                    the time. They were deceptive. One of them has been fired, I'm happy to say, and
                    the other is wandering somewhere, having divorced his wife. They thought they
                    were being clever by not doing what they were supposed to do. And, as a result,
                    I don't know what happened. I've never had any evidence that anything was found
                    by the Libyans or the Chadians that has embarrassed us. But there was concern.
                    The Agency was concerned. And they didn't believe me when I told them that it
                    was in large measure their own station's fault that led to this problem.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we drove by the embassy; we drove by the burning cathedral, the burning
                    grandstand steps, burning houses and wires across the street and soldiers
                    wandering aimlessly with their guns at ready. But they respected our white
                    flags, and we got as far as the French Embassy, where the ambassador was in the
                    process of reforming these convoys and sending us the last mile to the airport.
                    After a half an hour of discussion and deciding the priorities and conditions,
                    we made the last run. Once we got on the air base, it was a perimeter that the
                    French were ready to defend. And we had quarters in what amounted to
                    barracks.</p>
                <p>I'll never forget that night. They invited us to dinner, and there at dinner was
                    a bottle of wine. That's the French!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, gosh. Well, then, in the end, you retired in '81. What
                        have you been doing since that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Well, I retired because I really felt there was no future in this new
                    administration. I had had no success with Crocker, who only got approved, you
                    know, in June of '81. He was held hostage by Jesse Helms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A senator from North Carolina, very conservative, who had
                        his own agenda.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: That's right, who apparently said, “I will not approve Crocker until you
                    give me authority to make a deputy assistant secretary position available to
                    someone of my choice.” Such is, at least, what I've always heard.</p>
                <p>And the atmosphere was just very poor. That whole Haig business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alexander Haig.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Yes, the secretary. And the Casey influence. I have these documents that
                    show that I was consistent in saying, “Don't support Habr�, he is not a popular
                    political leader, he's a guerrilla leader.” They ignored my advice, so I went
                    back.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>I retired to the only house that I owned at the time, a house we had built while
                    I was in Botswana located on a lake in New Hampshire. We thought it was an ideal
                    place to get away from Washington, and the tropics, even Africa. We built it at
                    a place called Eastman, near the town of Grantham, twenty miles from downtown
                    Hanover, New Hampshire. And we moved up there. It was a winterized place. I did
                    some articles; I did some consulting. I was asked to go to Norway, for example,
                    to meet with a group of Shell Oil people who were plotting the future: what
                    should they be doing in the Eighties? I went on speaking trips to West Africa as
                    an AMPART. Do you know the AMPART program?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORLAND: Lecturing on U.S. policy toward Africa, on U.S. foreign policy, on our
                    policy toward Southern Africa. In 1983 I went to the Center for International
                    Affairs at Harvard for several meetings, and they asked me if I would sign on as
                    a fellow at the CFIA, a prestigious organization that focuses on foreign policy.
                    And from '84 to '87, I gave lectures there, ran a course at the JFK Institute of
                    Politics a couple of blocks away. I lectured, recruited, I taught a course at a
                    community college. I was reading widely. My aim at this time was to consolidate
                    my Foreign Service experience. I had been running pretty fast and hard, and I
                    hadn't really had a chance to do a lot of reading and thinking that I thought
                    was relevant. I enjoyed that.</p>
                <p>But by '84, my wife was not at all happy in the New Hampshire woods. It was
                    rural, and she used to say, “My only companions are the dripping pine trees.”
                    She was glad to go to Boston. We lived in Cambridge for three years, '84 to '87.
                    I did these academic things. I made several trips to Africa as a speaker. And I
                    went to Norway for a month. My son was then in Tromso. Enjoyed that.</p>
                <p>In '87 we decided that we'd had enough of Cambridge. We had two sons in the
                    Foreign Service. Their base was Washington, and we decided to come down here.
                    Our daughter was also here. We found an apartment in the Westchester, moved here
                    in July of '87 and have been here ever since. For three years I ran the Africa
                    Studies Program at the Foreign Service Institute.</p>
                <p>At the end of '89, I left and, for a year, was the program director for the
                    Center for International Private Enterprise (CIPE), which is funded by the
                    Congress of the United States, through USIA and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
                    The idea of CIPE is to strengthen the pro-free-market lobby everywhere in the
                    world. I was in charge of trying to identify existing nuclei of Chambers or
                    think tanks with people who would lobby for a free market system. The aim was to
                    provide guidance for elected officials, and show them, “Look, here is a vested
                    interest that has the prosperity of the nation at heart. And you should do what
                    you can to protect and enhance and strengthen these private-sector interests.”
                    So I did that for a year, until '91.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>Since '91, I've been doing consulting. I worked for some time with a group trying
                    to renew U.S. investment in South Africa. That has not proven productive, as you
                    know.</p>
                <p>I'm an associate with a group called Export Marketing Associates. After some
                    months of surveying the ground, we have some very promising contacts in the
                    Middle East.</p>
                <p>And I was elected in '91 to be a member of the governing board of the American
                    Foreign Service Association, and a member of the editorial board, last year, of
                    the Foreign Service Journal.</p>
                <p>So, between the private sector and other interests...</p>
