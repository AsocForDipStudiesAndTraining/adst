                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: September 19, 1991</p>

                <p>[Note: This interview has not been edited by Mr. Matthews]</p>
                <p>Q: I want to thank you on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and
                    Training for giving us your time. I would like to start by asking you to give us
                    some of your background.</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I was born in North Carolina in 1933. I am not named after Wade
                    Hampton, a major figure in Southern history. I was named after my maternal
                    grandfather who never had a son - my mother was an only child. So I got his full
                    name plus my father's name to legitimize me - Matthews. My grandfather was a
                    country doctor by the name of Wade Hampton Bynam. He was named after his
                    grandfather or great grandfather; I think the latter was the grandfather of the
                    famous General Wade Hampton, who was to become the first post-Reconstruction
                    governor of South Carolina. I am not a direct descendent of the famous Wade
                    Hampton; the Wade Hampton which was in our line was an undistinguished
                    Revolutionary War major.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to school, in North Carolina?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I did my undergraduate work at the University of North Carolina, Chapel
                    Hill. I got my Bachelor's Degree in 1954 in zoology. I am probably one of the
                    few Foreign Service Officers who lasted for a reasonable amount of time having a
                    degree in zoology. After University, I entered the Army for a couple of years;
                    then went to law school and joined the Foreign Service from there. My interest
                    in foreign affairs - until my employment - was an avocation. During my
                    undergraduate years, I was on the inter-collegiate debate squad, participated in
                    the student legislature and was a candidate for president of the University's
                    student body - unsuccessfully, I would note. I might just mention that our
                    debate team was quite successful; it consisted of a fellow by the name Beverly
                    Webb and myself. We usually took the affirmative side in most of the debates,
                    many of which were about free trade. The negative side was represented by two
                    other members of our team - one of whom was Charles Kuralt - a well known TV
                    personality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sparked your interest in foreign affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Since I was a kid, I was interested in international affairs. I
                    remember participating in some high school debates which covered international
                    relations issues. As I said, during our collegiate debates, we often discussed
                    matters related to international affairs such as free trade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you hear about the Foreign Service and how did you
                        geinto it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Not like many others who had focused on the Foreign Service for long
                    times. I like to say that I joined because I had a losing hand in a poker game
                    one night. I was at law school; instead of studying or writing up case
                    histories, I joined a poker game in my digs. I had a losing hand; I folded and
                    left the table to get a drink. Someone else had also left his table; he told me
                    that someone from the Department of State was coming the next day to talk about
                    the Foreign Service. I asked what time that meeting would take place; it was
                    going to be at 10 am in the Student Union building. I said I might drop by to
                    hear him out because I just happened to a free hour between my 9 am class and my
                    11 am class.</p>
                <p>My interest was peeked. I always enjoyed taking exams just for the hell of it. I
                    looked on them as a challenge. After I heard the Department's representatives, I
                    picked up the application forms which I filled out and sent them in. Then I went
                    to Jacksonville, FL, to take the written exam which at the time took up all
                    morning. After that test, I thought that I probably did pass, although I really
                    didn't care that much at the time. I did pass.</p>
                <p>After the written, came the oral exam, which I took in May, 1957. That was about
                    a two hour structured interview - although not nearly as structured as it is
                    today. The decision whether a candidate had passed was made right after the end
                    of the interview. But all that meant was that one's name was added to the list
                    of eligibles. At that time, the oral exam was worth 25% of the total score.
                    Although I think I barely squeaked by in the written exam - just enough to pass;
                    probably just above the pass line. That would not have attracted any one's
                    attention if they were reviewing the results of the written exam. But
                    apparently, I did impress the panel during my orals and they gave me a very high
                    score. I was therefore offered an appointment to an entering class which was
                    supposed to start in early October. That was unusually fast, but I think that it
                    was due to my rating of my oral exam.</p>
                <p>Q: How would you describe your entry classmates? What kinds of people were they?
                    What was their motivation for joining the Foreign Service? How did they see the
                    world and the U.S. role in it?.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I should perhaps answer that question by first discussing my own
                    motivation for joining the Foreign Service. I was completely up front about it,
                    both on the short biographic sketch that one had to write as part of the
                    application for oral exams, and during the oral exam, when the issue arose
                    briefly. When I was asked for my reasons for applying for the Foreign Service, I
                    told the panel that I had been interested in international affairs - along with
                    many other subjects. Since childhood, I enjoyed new experiences and challenges,
                    e.g., new cultures. I could not have envisaged me sitting at a desk in some law
                    firm “looking down the hall where the senior partners had their offices. If I
                    kept my nose clean, I too could aspire to be at the end of the hall twenty years
                    hence.” This was a description given me by a lawyer who worked for a prestigious
                    law firm. That was not what I intended to do with my life. I liked new
                    challenges and I thought that was what the Foreign Service would offer.</p>
                <p>I also generally agreed with the administration's position on national security
                    matters. I thought that we were taking positions that were good for the country
                    and probably for the world.</p>
                <p>I agreed with the ethical and moral standpoints which were being followed. In
                    1957, there were significant challenges facing the U.S. and I thought that I
                    might be able to contribute something to meeting those challenges. That is why I
                    wanted to join the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>The starting salary was, I believe, $4, 750 per annum. It was raised a little bit
                    during my first year. I thought it was adequate for the times; it was
                    competitive. Had I completed my law school and gotten a degree, I undoubtedly
                    would have made more. Even though I had an offer, after my first year at law
                    school, to work on estates and trusts after obtaining my law degree. This came
                    from personal contacts I had made in Orlando, Florida. That was an attractive
                    offer, but I told the person who made the offer that I wanted to give the
                    Foreign Service a try for a year or two. If I didn't like it, I would return to
                    law school, get my degree and if the position was still open, would be glad to
                    join his firm. He indicated that I would be welcomed. I told all of this to the
                    oral exam panel - i.e. that I was not committed at that stage to the Foreign
                    Service, but that if an offer was made before I would finish my law degree
                    academic work, I would commit myself to serve for at least a couple of years.
                    Then if I liked the Foreign Service and it liked me, I would probably remain in
                    it.</p>
                <p>There were about 27 of us in the entrance class that Fall. We had a wide spread
                    of ages represented, ranging from the early twenties to the early thirties - the
                    maximum age at the time was 31, if I remember correctly. I was twenty-four. We
                    must have had two or three who were very close to the maximum age; if they had
                    waited any longer, they probably would not have qualified.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>All of entered as FSO-8 - the lowest grade at the time. The Department was at the
                    time not giving credit for advanced academic work or work experience. Two or
                    three of my classmates had Ph.D.s; I think one or two had law degrees - they
                    were members of the Bar. The more typical class member would have had a
                    Bachelor's Degree or a Masters-equivalent - more of the latter. These were
                    people like myself who had a year or two of post-graduate work. I was probably
                    representative of the average of the incoming class.</p>
                <p>I believe there were six or seven females in our group. There was one black; I
                    think he was the only person whom we would define as minority. I don't believe
                    we had any Hispanics or Asians or American Indians. I might note parenthetically
                    that of the class, there are only three remaining in the Foreign Service. I
                    retired about 13 months ago; only three of my classmates were still in the
                    Service at the time, as there are today. One is an ambassador on his second
                    ambassadorial tour; he was also a deputy assistant secretary. One other is the
                    administrative counselor for our Mission to the UN. The third is the economic
                    counselor in Geneva.</p>
                <p>Q: At the time you entered the Foreign Service, how did you see the world
                    situation and the U.S. role in it? Did you and your classmates feel that you
                    would be missionaries?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: The Cold War was very much in bloom at the time. But we did not see
                    ourselves as going out to win the War. It is difficult to characterize a whole
                    class; some probably did not think very much about these global problems; others
                    had thought and written a great deal about the issues. In terms of the time,
                    were we more or less liberal than our contemporaries? I think we covered the
                    gambit, although I think that probably on balance we were a little more liberal
                    than an average person of our age. There was nothing so simplistic as “We are
                    going out to fight the Cold War.” There was no missionary fervor. We did believe
                    to be part of an effort to advance U.S. interests as we saw them. But we didn't
                    really talk about this issue at least in these terms. I think most of us wanted
                    challenging assignments. A number of us had hoped for assignments to specific
                    posts for personal reasons. I myself, for example, had served in the Army in
                    Germany; I hoped that I would be assigned to that area, despite the fact that
                    ordinarily I like new challenges. An assignment to Germany would certainly have
                    been new since my role would have been entirely different from that I performed
                    in the military. I already spoke German and the Department provided me some
                    additional training in that language, at my initiative because I wanted to
                    improve my language competence. I don't think I took an exam in German; I
                    probably would have ended up with a 2/3 (2 on speaking and 3 on reading) on a
                    test - 3/3 being conversant with a language and 5/5 being bilingual.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You finished your training in Spring of 1958.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: That's right. We had finished the three months' basic course. That was
                    principally an orientation course designed to impart to a wide variety of people
                    a basic primer in the Department and the U.S. government. We were also taught
                    the principles behind the formulation of U.S. foreign policy, including a
                    smattering of history. But there was little attention paid to philosophy or
                    academic subjects. We had to do a lot of work in the human relations area -
                    testing, how to work in groups, leadership abilities, etc. We had some senior
                    officers - old ambassadors - speak on “what worked for me.” We had what we
                    called an informal “big brother” system, which didn't really work that well.
                    Each of us was paired with a senior Foreign Service officer, who had some
                    reasonable success in the Foreign Service. The idea was that he would tutor us -
                    advise us on practical matters that were not easily taught in the classroom.
                    That didn't work too well. I may have met a couple of times with my “big
                    brother” over drinks or something social, but I can't remember who it was or
                    what sage advise he gave me. It was an enjoyable part of the training, but not a
                    major part of the training program.</p>
                <p>Q: After the course, you served briefly as an exchange officer in the Department
                    and then were assigned to Munich. How was the exchange officer assignment?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: First, I should note that I really didn't want that job. I wanted to go
                    to Munich right away. In fact, I had applied for a consular job in Munich. I
                    probably would have preferred an assignment to a political job, but consular
                    work ran a close second. I had no problem at all in doing consular work; in
                    fact, I was quite open minded about the possibility of making that my career. I
                    had no particular economic background and my interests were not that great in
                    that subject. I might have taken an economic assignment if it were in a
                    particularly interesting post where I could have some challenges even as junior
                    officer. I probably would have tried hard to steer away from administrative
                    work.</p>
                <p>In Washington, I was happily assigned to the International Exchange Service. That
                    was an office in the bureau for Public Affairs. I had one of the better junior
                    officers' jobs. I was a special projects officer in the Special Projects
                    Division of IES. That meant that issues which couldn't be pigeon-holed neatly
                    into some other divisions were assigned to us as well as those which may not
                    have appeared important enough by other division chiefs. The latter tended to
                    land on my desk. We had no geographic focus nor much functional one. So it was a
                    challenge and learning experience which is the reason why I joined the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>As an example of what I did, one case involved Joe Blachford, a tennis star who
                    later went into politics. He and his partner wanted to play exhibition games and
                    give clinics around the world. We didn't have resources for such a program, but
                    Blachford was more interested in facilitative assistance to work out
                    arrangements for his program, which was a new enterprise for him. So I helped
                    him to the extent I could.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>Another case involved a physician who came to the Department with an idea:
                    establish a program called “Project HOPE.” This program consisted of sending a
                    medical ship to under- served areas of the world. Since it was not clear that
                    such a project could be implemented, the Department didn't want to invest any
                    resources in it. The sponsor said that he had an offer of assistance from the
                    U.S. Navy, but questions remained. Could he get a surplus ship from the Navy?
                    Could he find the resources necessary to equip it? This case came to me. I
                    developed the initial Departmental assistance program for “Project HOPE.” Today
                    the program still continues although it has left the seas and is now implemented
                    on land. That was a very successful program. I don't claim much credit for that
                    success, but I was the project officer for the Department and developed the
                    Department's involvement, which was consisted essentially of providing
                    facilitative assistance.</p>
                <p>Those are two illustrations of what I did in IES; I lasted there foabout eighteen
                    months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1959, you went to Munich, a large consulate general,
                        where yoserved until 1962. What were your duties in Munich?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I think I was one the very few officers in our class who was assigned
                    to his or her first choice of posts. Most of my colleagues tried for embassies
                    and many were disappointed. When I first arrived I participated in the general
                    rotation program that the C.G. had developed for junior officers. Since I was
                    assigned by the Army to Augsburg, I had some familiarity with Munich. I spent a
                    year in the consular section, exclusively in the Visa Section. That was a normal
                    assignment for a junior officer regardless of background. We had a large Visa
                    Section; we had about six or seven officers in that Section. About half were
                    junior officers like myself on their first tour. I believe that I spent the
                    first six months working as immigrant officer in charge of one of three teams.
                    Each team consisted of about 5 or 6 local national employees. They processed the
                    applications - according to an alphabetical order. We processed both German
                    citizens as well as refugees living in camps. The program was in full swing. We
                    had a large number of refugees applying for immigrant visas; many came from
                    Eastern Europe.</p>
                <p>Each application required a lot of processing. We coordinated with Immigration
                    and Nationalization Service (INS). Each applicant had to be interviewed; it was
                    then a much more drawn out process than today's. We asked a lot of questions
                    about the individual's background; there were many records that had to be
                    reviewed which often raised many more questions. One of the most difficult
                    issues was the applicant's involvement in Nazi activities or in a communist
                    movement. Many applicants had criminal records; a few applicants had been in and
                    out of insane asylums. So we were quite busy and I enjoyed it for the six months
                    I worked on immigrant visas.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Then I was offered an opportunity to head up the non-immigrant unit. There was
                    only one American officer in that unit and I served there for about six months.
                    Munich was a center for the Eastern Europe emigres. I had to go to Neuberg once
                    a month; I would exchange information with knowledgeable people including
                    interviewing refugee camp residents. Those were preliminary contacts with
                    applicants. Most of my time in Neuberg was devoted to information collection
                    from the German authorities - information we needed to pass on an applications
                    from refugees in camps. I had hoped that after one year in consular work, I
                    could move to a political job. There were two positions in the Consulate General
                    for junior officers. One job was the second position in a two officers unit
                    which concentrated on internal political affairs. The other was the second
                    officer in the Eastern Europe political affairs - again a two officer unit. That
                    section dealt with Radio Liberty, Radio Free Europe and liaisoned with groups
                    working on Eastern Europe, including East Germany.</p>
                <p>When I first arrived, I had an interview with Ken Scott, the Consul General, who
                    later became our ambassador to Ghana. The Deputy Principal Officer for most of
                    my tour was Owen Zurhellen who finished his Foreign Service career as Ambassador
                    to Suriname where I had contact with him again when I was DCM and Charg� in
                    Guyana. Both Scott and Zurhellen told me that after a year in the Consular
                    section, they were prepared to let me try a political job. So I talked to
                    Richard Johnson who was the head of the Political Section. He told me that there
                    was a Bavarian Party which in the last election had garnered about 20% of the
                    vote. The consulate general did not think that this party had much of a future,
                    but wasn't certain. In any case, the Political Section did not have enough time
                    to pay much attention to it, but Johnson was ready to let me become the expert
                    on that Party. He said he would help and provide guidance if necessary. He did
                    note that I was still fully employed in the Visa Section. So all political work
                    would have to be done in the evening and on week-ends. That is what I did; I met
                    many Party member officials. When they would come to see the CG, I would be
                    asked to sit in, if I had time. I went to their various rallies and conventions.
                    I wrote some reports on this Party which reflected some skepticism about its
                    future. In fact, the Party disappeared in the longer run. But I got a good
                    introduction into political work - contacting, reporting, etc. Munich was unique
                    among the CGs because it had a lot of political reporting to do.</p>
                <p>So when I moved to the Embassy, I was well prepared for report writing. My work
                    had been critiqued by the CG, I had learned how to make contacts; I had learned
                    interviewing skills.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the Munich CG's view of Germany and its future? Were we still
                    concerned about a rise of the right again? Was there any concern about Germany
                    splitting into separate Laender?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: The prevalent view, which I shared, at the time was that Germany's
                    policies were in accord with our own interests. When I was in the Army
                    1955-1956, Ostpolotik was well underway at the time and was blossoming while I
                    was in Munich and thereafter.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>We had some concern for the reappearance of a Nazi-like movement as well as the
                    possibility of a fragmented Germany. But I think in general these potential
                    problems were not high on our agenda. We wanted a viable central government
                    which was not immobilized by powers given to the states. We of course supported
                    federalism, which is common to Germany and the U.S. If one of the states had
                    seceded, it most likely would have been Bavaria because that Land had a lot of
                    unique institutions. The Christian Democrats were the largest party in Bavaria
                    at the time, but it had to go into a coalition with the Christian Social Union
                    (CSU) to govern Bavaria - as it still true today. Strauss at the time was the
                    Chairman of the CSU. He was dynamic and very conservative; he would from time to
                    time snipe that the CDU in Bonn. The Social Democrats were the opposition in
                    those days. It was a powerful party and we believed that it might take over the
                    government sometime in the future - as it did.</p>
                <p>We were very concerned that the Social Democrats maintain an anti-communist
                    attitude - an attitude more in tune with our security interests and U.S.
                    interests in Germany. The party had a radical left group which were suggesting
                    policies entirely inimical to our interests. Fortunately this group was a small
                    minority. We were concerned, but ranked the possibility of a party take-over by
                    the radicals in Bavaria pretty low on the scale. We maintained close contacts
                    with all three major parties. In fact, I think CG Munich had better contacts
                    with the Social Democrats than it had with the CSU.</p>
                <p>There was some concern, although relatively minor, about Strauss' tendencies to
                    the right. We had very good relations with him. Strauss was no one's puppet; he
                    had his own mind, but we did not view at the time as a potential leader of a
                    revanchist neo-Nazi group. I think we might have been a little more concerned
                    had Strauss been Chancellor rather than Konrad Adenauer or Ludwig Earhart. We
                    viewed Strauss as a generally constructive force. His economic polices were
                    certainly in accord with ours. The chancellors in Bonn had similar views on
                    economic development, so that worked well. Strauss was one the most fiercely
                    anti-communists in politics.</p>
                <p>As I remember, we were most concerned with was the DFU (the German Peace
                    Movement). Included in the membership of that party were some old communists who
                    dominated the party, some radical socialists, etc. The Communists Party was
                    illegal in Germany at the time.</p>
                <p>The DFU either existed when I arrived in Munich, or was founded around that time.
                    It had been a splinter group which organized itself into a political party. We
                    were somewhat concerned that this party might grow; it didn't, but we kept a
                    watchful eye on it. We had contacts with that group, as we had with all
                    political parties in Bavaria, but we left no doubt in the DFU that we didn't
                    approve of it. It was not a group of people who were supporters of the U.S.</p>
                <p>Q: The period we are discussing was post-Hungarian uprising. We were concerned
                    that the emigre group, much through Radio Free Europe, was trying to incite
                    Hungarians to take up arms again - without U.S. support. Did we watch these
                    emigre groups to make sure they were not inciting action that might drag us into
                    a development with which we wanted no part?</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yes and No. The U.S. government was watching these groups. But I was in
                    the Internal Political Section and this issue was not on our agenda. I did of
                    course talk to my colleagues in the Eastern Affairs Section who sat just down
                    the hall from us. Kermit Midtune was in charge assisted by Kenneth Skoag. They
                    were in the CG for about the same period that I was. They carried out the
                    liaisons with the emigres and wrote reports on these contacts. There were other
                    parts of the U.S. government who also had a watch brief - i.e. elements of an
                    intelligence agency, the Embassy in Bonn, our defense establishment in Bavaria
                    as well as probably our people in Radio Free Europe-Radio Liberty. I think it is
                    fair to say that there were some concerns about U.S. policy before and at the
                    time of the Hungarian uprising. A number of people thought that we had been a
                    catalyst or at least not tried to hold back the Hungarian insurgents in 1956. I
                    think that experience had soured most the emigre groups; they did not look to us
                    for military support or other assistance had there been another 1956 event.</p>
                <p>Q: From Germany you were transferred to Salvador, Brazil - an entirely different
                    environment. You were there between 1962 and 1964. How did that assignment come
                    about?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Once again, I was lucky; I had listed Salvador, Brazil on the annual
                    “wish”list that we used to fill out in those days - known as the April Fools
                    list because it was due April 1. I specifically said that I would be interested
                    in a position at my level - that is an FSO-6 since I had received two promotions
                    during my Munich tour - one at the time of my arrival and one around departure
                    time.. Contrary to Dick Johnson's advice - he was my boss and probably an FSO-4
                    under the grade system then prevailing. I put on my list a “coastal consulate in
                    Brazil.” El Salvador was close enough. So in the first two assignments I was
                    lucky, having gotten the exact post - Munich - on the first try and close enough
                    on the second.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Johnson had given me good career advice, which I recognized as such at the time.
                    He thought that I should try to get a political job in an embassy in an area of
                    importance. I didn't follow that advice because I think I was still a bit of
                    dilettante - some of which I never lost. I was still attracted at the time by
                    the challenges that had attracted me to the Foreign Service in the first place.
                    I was interested in the new, in different things, different cultures, learning a
                    new language. I thought that entering a new area with a new language would put
                    me at some disadvantage with my colleagues in a political section staffed by
                    experts or near experts. I would be low on the totem pole in any case because of
                    my grade; add to that my lack of area experience and I think that suggested to
                    me to look in a different direction. I felt that a small consulate would give me
                    some more supervisory experience, more an opportunity to work in all of the
                    facets of work in the consulate. My work in Munich had been very circumscribed.
                    I had learned visa work - I thought pretty well in light of the many differing
                    visas problems I had faced. I thought I knew political work, especially that
                    dealing with internal politics. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, it was
                    possible to have such experiences in a constituent post; today you really to be
                    assigned to an Embassy. Today consulates, with rare exceptions, are not involved
                    in political analysis, even at a level which would engage a junior officer. Many
                    of the consulates are of course still very active in the visa issuing
                    process.</p>
                <p>So I felt that a small consulate in Brazil would have given me a better knowledge
                    of the totality of U.S. representation; furthermore, I would add knowledge of a
                    another language. I always liked the idea of living in the tropics - I had lived
                    in Florida and that was the closest I got to the tropics. I saw Brazil as the
                    country of the future.</p>
                <p>Salvador was at the time was the second largest city in North-East Brazil. It had
                    a population of about 650,000. In our consulate district which included the
                    states of Bahia and Segip - central North-East Brazil. The whole consular
                    district had a population of about 6,500,000. Salvador was the original colonial
                    capital of Brazil in pre-independence era. It was the center of African culture
                    in Brazil. The district had a variety of climatic conditions - a tropical jungle
                    area, a coastal area, a semi-arid area in the interior.</p>
                <p>I was assigned to Salvador before I went to Rio for Portuguese language training
                    - for about three months. I knew a little bit of Spanish and French, but I had
                    to start at the beginning with Portuguese.</p>
                <p>We don't have a consulate in Salvador anymore. We have only a consular agent
                    there now, as we have in many parts of the world. The smaller consulates in
                    Brazil were closed as money saving proposition. But in the early 1960s, Salvador
                    was the center of petroleum production. The Brazilians controlled the production
                    very tightly; they did not give concessions to American companies. There were a
                    lot of American companies in Bahia on contract to Petrogas, the Brazilian
                    monopoly of the energy field. They dealt with the broad spectrum of exploration
                    and production. That was of some interest to us.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Brazil was a federal republic. The states had considerable political influence
                    and power. At the time, Brazil was a flourishing democracy - disorderly, unclear
                    to observers where the country was heading. The society was not very stable. No
                    one knew whether Brazil would take the “Cuba road” or some other direction. Cuba
                    at the time was very much on our mind following Castro's take over in ate 1959.
                    He was articulating the need for revolution throughout Latin America.</p>
                <p>The early 1960s were the hay days of the Alliance for Progress which raised Latin
                    America on the U.S. foreign policy agenda. This newly developed U.S. interests
                    was one of the major reasons I volunteered for a coastal consulate in Brazil,
                    instead of a similar post in India or elsewhere in the world outside of Latin
                    America.</p>
                <p>We had a relatively small consulate in Salvador. There were two American officer
                    positions, and one American secretary, one American administrative specialist -
                    both FSS positions. The Consulate supported a number of Americans working for
                    other agencies. We had a USIS operation; there were a couple of people from the
                    assistance agency - although we did not have a mission. Those two technicians
                    were assigned to the University and the Geological Service. In fact, after my
                    arrival, I became the Alliance's officer in Salvador, in addition to my other
                    responsibilities. I did not mind because it meant when there was no other
                    Alliance official in town, I was able to take the Alliance's jeep. I took good
                    care of it, housing it in my garage; I did use for official purposes giving much
                    greater flexibility in covering our consular district than I would have had
                    otherwise. I took a number of trips into the interior, making sure that my
                    itinerary covered inspection of some “Food for Aid” work project. I always wrote
                    reports on those projects. At the same time, I would visit with mayors and other
                    officials of the towns I visited. I wanted to find out what the political
                    thinking was.</p>
                <p>Q: The Ambassador at the time was Lincoln Gordon. It was also a period when the
                    military took over the government - which lasted for many, many years. How was
                    your work before the coup and after? How did we view the developments in Rio
                    from Salvador?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: We were a relatively small part of the picture of Brazil. When I
                    arrived, the governor was Juracy Magallanes. He was an old-line politician -
                    center-right, having held a number of governmental and political positions.
                    Later, Magallanes became the second Foreign Minister of the military government.
                    Before that, he had been named as Ambassador to the U.S. - appointed by the
                    military government which took power in 1964. When I first met him, he believed
                    in democracy, but before the coup so were most politicians. He was a firm
                    anti-communist.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Magallanes was governor for about one half of my tour. As I suggested earlier, he
                    was a member of a relatively conservative party, which was supported largely by
                    business interests and the upper middle clas- not so much by rural agrarian
                    interests. He was succeeded by Antonio Lomanto, Jr., who belonged to the PTB,
                    the party which also included Joao Goulart, the President of Brazil and Leo
                    Brazolla.</p>
                <p>We reported on political developments, on what the media was saying, on economic
                    developments. The reports that were send in State channels were written by
                    either by my boss or myself. My first boss was Dirk Keyser who was followed by
                    Herald Midkiff. I was the vice-consul and therefore the number 2 officer. When
                    ever the Consul was away, that put me in charge; that I enjoyed. Not many junior
                    officers had such opportunity. I was about 30 when I was in charge.</p>
                <p>Brazilians are quite open and hospitable, making it easy to make contacts with
                    them. I had good language fluency; I used Portuguese almost exclusively with
                    Brazilians. I had access as a vice-consul to whomever I wished. I went on a trip
                    through the Bahia interior as part of a little delegation mostly from the
                    Brazilian Navy, headed by the Admiral in charge of the Navy in the Bahia region.
                    That was the beginning of a friendly relationship, which involved reciprocal
                    invitations to our homes. We were friendly with journalists; had good relations
                    with the governor and his Cabinet. We had very little contact with any
                    representatives of the federal government - which was in the process of moving
                    from Rio to Brasilia at the time. I don't believe I ever met Joao Goulart while
                    in Salvador.</p>
                <p>We reported from our prospective. I believe that our messages went directly to
                    the Department with info copies to the Embassy. I may be wrong on that, but I
                    believe that was the process. We had a large American community in our consular
                    district - mostly involved in the petroleum industry. They required a certain
                    amount of care; we didn't have to intervene very often on their behalf. Those
                    Americans had good relations with the government and Petrogas. We did push
                    American goods. We had an active USIS program.</p>
                <p>An active Communist Party operated in Salvador. I met some of the leaders of the
                    Party. One of them identified himself soon after my arrival; he invited me to
                    Makumba and Candelblay sessions. The latter is a type of dance with musical
                    accompaniment which evolved from a type of fighting that the slaves brought with
                    them from Africa. It is now ritualistic and stylistic, emphasizing use of feet
                    and elbows and hands. It could be compared in part to karaoke, but it is more of
                    a dance now than fighting. There were matches which put a premium on movements -
                    hand and feet. You were not supposed to actually kick the competitor. Makumba,
                    on the other hand, stemmed from voodoo with African music putting some people
                    into a trance.</p>
                <p>I would discuss political issues with him. If he was trying to subvert me, it
                    certainly was not evident. I reported this contact, but I must say that I didn't
                    gleam any new insights into the working of the Party, but I did learn a lot
                    about the sessions I mentioned earlier.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk a little about the military coup. First of all, is
                        that thproper word for what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: One could call that almost as one wishes. In some ways, if you believed
                    the pronouncements of the leaders, it could almost been called a revolution.
                    They pledged to transform Brazilian society. It turned out to be far short of a
                    revolution. I think a better characterization would be a “military take-over.” I
                    remember that event quite well. We did have some clues which suggested something
                    was going to happen. The day before the take-over, the head of our assistance
                    program, Jack Kubisch, visited us in Salvador when I was the senior American at
                    the post. He was going to sign an assistance agreement with the governor of
                    Bahia, Antonio Lamato, Jr. There were too many rumors floating around and
                    Kubisch cut his visit short to return to Rio. He turned over the final documents
                    to me and authorized me to sign on behalf of the Alliance during a signing
                    ceremony which was to be held the next day with the governor. That evening or
                    the following morning, it became quite clear that the military take-over was in
                    process. It was clear that Brazil was in a state of flux. Nevertheless, I went
                    to the governor's office where the signing was to take place. I was ushered into
                    Lamato's office where we exchanged few preliminary remarks. All of a sudden,
                    someone came into the office and announced that the President was on the phone
                    for the governor. Lamato rolled his eyes and when I volunteered to leave the
                    room, he told me to stay. So I sat there while the governor talked to Goulart.
                    There had been no signs of movement by the military in Bahia; everything was
                    quiet. The population was monitoring events in Rio through their radios. It was
                    very uncertain how this process would end. Would the military take-over be
                    successful or not?</p>
                <p>At this point, there was still doubt about the military's chances for success. As
                    I said, Lamato was on the telephone with Goulart. I of course heard only one
                    side of the conversation during which Lamato pledged his support for the
                    President, but refused to issue a statement - “it as not the right time.” Lamato
                    wanted to wait a while before issuing the statement, but he reassured Goulart
                    that he was in his corner. He assured the President that all was quiet in Bahia
                    and guessed that it was not likely that the military would support the
                    President.</p>
                <p>Then the conversation turned to making a phone call. Apparently Goulart asked
                    Lamato to call someone; the governor demurred saying that it would not be
                    appropriate at that moment. He opined that the best thing for him to do under
                    the circumstances was to sit tight and wait. He did add that as soon as he felt
                    it was prudent, he assured the President that he would go public with his
                    support.</p>
                <p>Then Lamato turned to me and said:” Doesn't he realize that if I said anything
                    now, I would be put out office in a second?” He was not going to say or do
                    anything until he saw what would happen. He told me that he was not at all
                    sanguine about Goulart being able to retain power.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Then we proceeded and had our signing ceremony for the assistance package. As a
                    matter of fact, the take-over was extraordinarily non-violent in Bahia. The
                    center of the take-over was Sao Paulo; the pro-Goulart military factions were
                    based in Rio. The two factions met at about the state borders; I heard that the
                    deal would include telephone calls from the Sao Paulo faction to the Rio faction
                    saying that it was moving from town to town. “We hope we don't meet up with you.
                    Since the Rio faction had not yet decided what it would do, it pulled its troops
                    as the Sao Paulo faction moved northwards. So the two factions never met.</p>
                <p>In Bahia, the military sided - as Lamato expected - with its Sao Paulo
                    colleagues. When the military took over the state, they posted a few guards here
                    and there. Initially, they did not expel Lamato; he remained as governor for
                    another few months. They did arrest Doria, the governor oSagipy, which was in
                    our consular district. As a matter of fact, Doria was on a prison ship which
                    anchored in Bahia harbor. He was much too left of Lamato.</p>
                <p>The first casualty in our district was in the interior of Bahia, after three or
                    four days of military rule. A soldier had been to a bar and had his fill of
                    liquor. Someone made some comments about the take-over and shots were fired
                    resulting in a death. There may have been few other deaths, but they took place
                    after the take-over had taken place. Leo Brazolla was still unaccounted for, but
                    he was found in Montevideo after slipping across the border from his ranch. That
                    was the last piece of the puzzle enabling the miliary to take over power in
                    Brazil.</p>
                <p>There was not much negative reaction from the U.S. Government. There may well
                    have been some individuals in the Embassy who felt that the take-over was
                    inevitable after the military decided that the economic situation was
                    deteriorating rapidly and sharply. There was considerable lawlessness in Brazil
                    toward the end of Goulart's Presidency. The government was trying to subvert the
                    military process. That caused a rebellion of sergeants, even after Goulart
                    informally appealed to the enlisted men to support him. I think that had we
                    vocal about our objections to the take-over, I doubt if the Brazilian military
                    would have paid much attention. After the beginning of the march from Sao Paulo
                    to Rio had started, Goulart appealed to the sergeants publicly. Whatever
                    resistance was offered was led by Brazolla, Goulart's brother in law. Brazolla
                    saw himself as the Brazilian version of Castro; he wanted a revolution which
                    would cast out the upper middle class. Goulart was much more cautious and
                    accommodating. So it was Brazolla who was viewed by the military and others as
                    the source of Brazil's problems; he became the target.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>The situation in Brazil was somewhat akin to what happened in Chile before the
                    Pinochet coup. There was a great deal of disorder; the economy was in serious
                    trouble because investments had dried up in light of situation in Brazil. I
                    remember well one headline from one of Bahia's newspapers - a conservative
                    paper: “ Someone should kill President Goulart” (or something similar.) This was
                    before the take over and was one of the most noticeable headlines I have ever
                    read. The paper went on to blame Goulart for all of Brazil's miseries which at
                    the time were numerous. Nothing happened to the newspaper. That was indicative
                    of where the winds were blowing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any great change in what you did after the take
                        over?Did you find it more difficult to make contacts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: No. Our contact on the far left - the communist acquaintance I
                    mentioned earlier - was arrested of course. Those who were not arrested, went
                    into hiding - some left the country, the others were mostly arrested later. But
                    all these people were later released. Cesius Doria went out to Fernando de La
                    Roina, the prison island. After 9-12 months, he was released and later became a
                    very successful business man in Rio. That kind of evolution became not
                    uncommon.</p>
                <p>The take over in March, 1964 was not violent. But certainly the left pretty well
                    disappeared - in prison, or out of the country or just silent. The take over
                    stimulated a terrific genuine outpouring of hope and sympathy among Brazilians,
                    especially from the middle class and much of the poorer class in Bahia. The
                    largest demonstration which I saw in Brazil - matched only by Carnival - was one
                    that supported the military. The march consisted of a variety of civic groups,
                    neighborhood associations, Candelblay clubs, etc. This took place about a week
                    after the take over; people marched spontaneously through the streets - some
                    actually cried. Some carried signs supporting restoration of order, some
                    demanded that democracy be restored, others wanted reform of the political
                    system. I remember thinking that if the military then installed a typical Latin
                    American military dictatorship without making fundamental changes in the system,
                    it would lose most of its public support. The next time that there might be
                    another revolution, it would probably be violent led by the left; the military
                    would have lost all credibility.</p>
                <p>So the population in general viewed the take-over as an opportunity for change;
                    it hoped that the military was going to take advantage of its opportunity. There
                    were of course some people - those in jail or fleeing - who would not have
                    shared these views, but I think the vast majority of Brazilians did. I would
                    guess that in the early days, the military had overwhelming support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1964, you were transferred to Lorenzo Marques.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: That is right. This also was the result of the personnel system. On my
                    preference list, I had included this post in Mozambique as political officer.
                    But in fact, I was assigned to a visa officer's position in the Department. That
                    did not make me very happy. I communicated my views to the Department; I did not
                    want to pursue a career in consular work - I had decided by this time I wanted
                    to be in the political “cone”. I finally got a letter from someone in Personnel
                    reminding that when I joined the Foreign Service, I was told about and had
                    accepted discipline. I was told to take the consular job and to stop
                    complaining. The final line suggested that if I didn't like the assignment, I
                    would be welcomed to leave the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>By this time, I could not go to some of the opportunities that I had during law
                    school.. But I did not discard the option of leaving. I decided to go back to
                    Washington to see whether I could get the assignment changed; if that wasn't
                    successful, then I was pretty much prepared to leave the FS and going back to
                    law school to start a new career. On my way home, my family - wife, two young
                    children - stopped in Rio. I should have mentioned that sometime earlier I had
                    married a high school teacher whom I had known from Washington days, but got
                    married in Germany while I was in Munich. Before boarding the ship home, I spent
                    a little time with the Embassy, giving my views and getting an “going-away”
                    briefing. In Rio I happened to run into Charles Grovert - an old friend whom I
                    had succeeded in IES. He was a political officer in Rio. I told him that I was
                    surprised to see him there; no one had told me. He said that he himself was
                    surprised; he had no idea that he would be assigned to Rio even as recently as a
                    few weeks. He told me that he thought he was going to Mozambique - at the time a
                    Portuguese colony - to be a political officer at our consulate there.</p>
                <p>I answered by observing that that was a strange turn of events because that was
                    just what I had put first on my “April Fools” wish list. I noted that I didn't
                    even know whether there was a vacancy, but I was delighted to hear that there
                    could be one. Grovert said that there would not have been one had his assignment
                    not be changed to Rio. He told me the reason that his assignment had been
                    canceled is because he made some remarks about Portuguese President Salazar -
                    probably ill-advised ones - to his language instructor at FSI. She happen to be
                    the wife of a military attache in the Portuguese Embassy. Those comments were
                    passed from person to person until they reached the Foreign Ministry in Lisbon.
                    In the meantime, my visa application to the Portuguese laid dormant in the
                    Portuguese Embassy - no action week after week. When the Department inquired
                    about the visa, it was told informally that it would never be acted upon - at
                    least not favorably. So the Department - in its usual snit - decided to show the
                    Portuguese that “they couldn't get away with that”; it would refuse to fill that
                    position in Mozambique.</p>
                <p>I don't know whether Salazar would have been greatly disturbed by this turn of
                    events - even if he known about it. I suspect that the political officer
                    position in Mozambique was not high on his agenda. In fact, I think the
                    Portuguese would have preferred for us to close our establishment there. But
                    that was the way the Department reacted.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>I then confirmed from Grovert that the position still existed, but he wasn't
                    certain how soon the Department would fill it. I said that I would check on that
                    when I returned to Washington - which is what I did. I talked to someone in PER;
                    I found out that then Consul General was also in Washington. So I had lunch with
                    him and he thought that I was the greatest thing since sliced bread - I had not
                    made any anti-Salazar remarks; in fact I had no opinion on that subject.</p>
                <p>Eventually, I was assigned to Lorenzo Marques. Before sending me out, the
                    Department thought that I needed a remedial course or something and assigned me
                    to FSI for the mid-career course for two or three months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you actually go to Mozambique?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I arrived on January 2, 1965. I remember that quite well because in
                    those days we traveled by ship. In fact, that was my last transfer by ship.
                    After that, we always flew. We arrived on a day (New Year's Eve) - one of two in
                    a year - when the harbor was closed. So we had to stay on board another 36
                    hours.</p>
                <p>My wife, our two small children - a 2 year old and a 6 months old - and I boarded
                    the “Independence” or the “Constitution” - I don't remember which - around
                    Thanksgiving in New York. We stopped in the Canary Islands for most of a day, as
                    we did when we anchored at Gibraltar. We also stopped at Barcelona, Nice or
                    Cannes before disembarking in Genoa. There we had to wait for a week before the
                    next ship - “The Rhodesia Castle” - would leave. I had a brother, who was also
                    in the Foreign Service, assigned to Dusseldorf, Germany. So we rented a car and
                    drove there for most of lay-over week.</p>
                <p>Around December 2, we boarded “The Rhodesia Castle.” It was a combined
                    passenger-freight vessel - it had about 120 passengers - comfortable, but not
                    luxurious. What attracted us to the ship was its nursery - they were very good
                    facilities. It sailed through the Mediterranean stopping at Port Said. We took
                    the opportunity and spent 24 hours in Cairo - saw the pyramids and the Egyptian
                    Museum. We then caught the ship as it was steaming out of the Suez Canal. My
                    wife almost dropped one of the children in the water because we first had to
                    board a lighter which had to match the speed of our ship. Once the lighter came
                    along side, we had to jump from it to a ladder on “the Rhodesia Castle” - helped
                    by some members of the crew. She handed the child to a seaman, along with our
                    Egyptian purchases.</p>
                <p>So we reboarded “The Rhodesia Castle” and then sailed along into the Indian
                    Ocean. We stopped in Aden - where we took a cab tour. What I remember of Aden
                    was watching a British convoy just returning from the interior; on one of the
                    hoods I saw, strapped down, was a dead guerilla - if he had been a deer. This
                    was the time when the British were trying to suppress a native up-rising.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>We then stopped in Mombasa where the ship took on some cargo. We stayed in
                    Mombasa for about six days watching cargo being unloaded and loaded. One of our
                    children caught chicken pox there. So one of us had to stay behind because we
                    could not take the child to the nursery. So we took separate overnight tours by
                    train to Nairobi. Then the other child came down with the chicken pox, but was
                    essentially cured by the time we got to Mozambique.</p>
                <p>The we stopped in Dar where we stopped for a day. Dar was important to me because
                    the leader of the only consequential guerilla organization, Frelimo, fighting in
                    Mozambique, had his headquarters in Dar. I was advised bEuropean Bureau to stay
                    away from these insurgents on the grounds that I would be seen as meddling in
                    the internal affairs of a Portuguese overseas province. The African Bureau
                    didn't object, but was not enthusiastic. After consulting with a number of
                    colleagues, I decided that prudence would be the best tactic at the time. There
                    were others who had contact with Frelimo and reported on it. So I didn't make
                    contact.</p>
                <p>Then we sailed to Durban where we spent another day and then on to Lorenzo
                    Marques. The whole trip took a month almost to the day from the time we boarded
                    the ship in Genoa.</p>
                <p>Q: The old Foreign Service! I think that you probably arrived in much better
                    shape than if had flown overnight to Mozambique. How long were you in
                    Mozambique?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Absolutely right, despise the chicken pox. I stayed iMozambique from
                    January 2, 1965 to March 5, 1967.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Mozambique at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: A insurgency had broken out in the North - roughly in September, 1964 -
                    with Frelimo raiding from its bases in Tanzania. One of my assignments was to
                    evaluate the situation and predict what would happen in Mozambique. It was
                    something of a James Bond assignment. The question I had to answer whether we
                    could expect a free and independent Mozambique in the near future or whether we
                    should assume that the Portuguese would be able to repress the rebellion and
                    therefore maintain Mozambique as an overseas province. That latter outcome would
                    have depended on a heavily armed Portuguese presence - a large drain on its
                    military resources. Some of us thought that the outcome might be something in
                    between and it became my job to evaluate and make policy recommendations. We
                    actually made recommendations on what U.S. policy should be. These were the
                    “Soapy” Williams days; he was the Assistant Secretary for African Affairs. The
                    Portuguese desk officer with whom we were in frequent contact because he was
                    responsible of Portugal's overseas provinces was Ted Briggs, his boss was George
                    Landau - the Iberian Country Director.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>We also dealt with the African Bureau, primarily on administrative support
                    matters. But we did, for substance report, to the European Bureau. Such an
                    organizational confusion of course was reflected in the opposite views that we
                    received from the two Bureaus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lorenzo Marques was a Consulate General at the time. Is
                        thacorrect? Who was in charge and how did it operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: It was a Consulate General. We reported directly to the Department. On
                    most messages, EUR - the Iberian division - was the action office with copies
                    provided to AF. I mentioned that I had met the CG - Thomas K Wright - while both
                    of us were in Washington. He had been our Ambassador in Mali. He was identified
                    with the African Bureau.</p>
                <p>When I arrived, much to my surprise, we were met by Al Lafanier, the deputy
                    Principal Officer - a position that was not filled when he left, leaving some of
                    that workload to me. He told me that Wright had left a couple of days before on
                    transfer orders. I was later told that he was viewed as having been identified
                    with AF. He certainly seemed to favor independence. I was told that when he
                    showed visitors - probably including Portuguese officials - around our offices,
                    he would talk about “when” Mozambique would be independent and would show the
                    visitors where the Ambassador's office would be, etc. Nor surprisingly, the
                    Portuguese reacted strongly to Wright expressing his views in this manner. It
                    was the same attitude reflected in their denial of Grovert's visa application. I
                    was an unknown quantity, so I had few problems.</p>
                <p>So the acting principal officer - former deputy - headed the CG. He was also the
                    economic-commercial officer. CIA had a representative there - undeclared. He
                    arrived roughly at the same time I did, creating all sorts of confusion for the
                    Portuguese. Their intelligence was not very good and they did not know whether I
                    was CIA or whether it was my colleague. Both of us were political officers
                    further confusing the Portuguese; they really didn't know who was the CIA agent.
                    So they put a tail on both of us for about two months which led to their
                    conclusion that I was not the CIA agent. The Principal Officer had an a American
                    secretary. There was a communicator and a administrative officer. I handled
                    political and consular affairs. I had a consular assistant during most of my
                    tour. I also during about half my tour there handled economic affairs due to a
                    series of vacancies and that sort of thing. I had, however, an economic and
                    commercial local assistant. He had a Ph.D. from a university in Goa. He was Goan
                    and had lived in Portugal a brief time. He had spent much of his adult life in
                    Mozambique. He was good in what he did.</p>
                <p>Q: Before we move to the political situation, let's first [do] the consular. Were
                    there any particular consular problems or cases or anything of that nature that
                    bring to mind?</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: None that spring to mind. Consular work there was rather routine,
                    largely dealing with people immigrating to Mozambique and probably had their
                    applications for visas [to the U.S.] prior to the time they came to Mozambique;
                    and American citizenship [issues]. There was a fairly sizable Gulf oil operation
                    there at the time. In Americans, we are talking about 60-80 with Gulf oil, plus
                    a lot of others, and so they had passports and their problems and so on.</p>
                <p>Q: When I think of oil workers I think of the terms for them around there,
                    roughnecks or roustabouts or so on which sometimes describes this is pretty hard
                    work. Did you have any problems of them ending up in jail or that sort of
                    thing?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: No problems that we really had to get involved in. The Gulf oil people
                    did have problems, some of them getting into jail and that sort of thing, but
                    they had a good relationship with the Portuguese authorities. The Portuguese
                    authorities tried to make sure that nobody was killed, and so they would go and
                    get them out an ship them home if there was any real trouble. So, we rarely got
                    involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now on the economic side, what were there any
                        Americainterests there other than the oil exploration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: It was quite limited. We were successful I think in selling a few
                    locomotives to the Mozambique rail system. The rail system was substantial
                    because the port of Lourenco Marques was a major South African port and
                    Rhodesian port, Avira and Lourenco Marques which the British call Byara, the
                    port up in the middle part. I'm using the old name of course, Laurence au March
                    which was the name when I was there. The transportation was the biggest thing we
                    had an interest in other than oil. Of course, we exported a fair number of
                    cashews. I think it was the biggest source of cashew nuts for the United States,
                    and we exported quite a bit of frozen shrimp and lobster tails from Mozambique
                    waters. No, our commercial interests were quite limited there. Our consular
                    interests were handled by one assistant, and when she was away, the local
                    secretary handled them. Consular work took up I would say at the most 20% of my
                    time, probably less.</p>
                <p>Q: Could you tell me what was the impression you got from the officers serving
                    there when you arrived about whither Mozambique to begin with before you did
                    your own thing?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I told you Reich's position earlier. He had gone by the time I got
                    there. There was a six month interim before Reich's replacement arrived and I
                    think he was an FSO-3 officer which would be the equivalent of an FSO-1 now
                    under the present system. I, incidentally was an FSO-6 when I arrived, but my
                    promotion came through shortly whenever the new list came out, I was an FSO-5,
                    equivalent to an FSO-3 now. I was mid-grade.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are talking about a[n Army] captain in the
                        militarapproximately.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Something like that. I was in my early 30s, 31-32. The CIA officer
                    there whose name I will not mention, but the one who they thought might be me,
                    we had a lot to do with each other. He was a very open individual, and we
                    probably shared a few things we shouldn't have shared.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, I would like to tell one anecdote because it because it was
                    important at that particular point. As I said, I had a tail put on me, and he
                    had a tail put on him. Our car arrived, a white Ford station wagon, not too long
                    after I got there. This would have been a few weeks afterward. So, one of the
                    first trips I took with my wife and kids up to see the hippopotamuses on the
                    Inquatmi, I think, was the name of the river. I'm a little confused on the river
                    name. Maybe I got it mixed up. Anyway it was about 35 miles out of town. We
                    decided we'd go not by the interior road which was a paved road, a main north
                    south highway, but by a little road down by the beach, a little tiny dirt
                    road.</p>
                <p>So, we were driving along, and I saw this little grey Volkswagen which was my
                    tail some little distance back. Then, we had a flat tire or something. We
                    stopped and got out and to my absolute disgust, I found that somebody had stolen
                    the jack from the car.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This happened quite a bit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Oh, yes. The VW was stopped some distance behind. This was completely a
                    one lane dirt road with no traffic whatsoever on it. I scratched my head a
                    little and walked back to the car and explained in Portuguese what had happened,
                    the car did not have a jack, did they have a jack? The two people in it, plain
                    clothes security, white, Portuguese, looked at each other, didn't say a word to
                    me, got out their jack and walked up to the car. They also had their lug wrench
                    which had also been stolen. They jacked it up and while I tried to help a
                    little, they changed my tire for me, put it back on. Not one word, I made a few
                    comments, but they didn't say a word to me. They let it down and walked back to
                    their car. I waited a reasonable time for them to get back; it was a couple of
                    hundred yards behind us. Then we went on the rest of our trip, looked at the
                    hippopotami and came on back. They followed us all the way back.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Some time later I got to know fairly well, I think I called on him already,
                    Antonio Vas, the local Mozambique chief of PITI, Police Internationale [etc.],
                    the Portuguese security police. The secret police if you want to call it
                    although it wasn't entirely secret. We used to exchange little jokes. We'd both
                    go with our kids to the Palana Hotel pool on Sunday morning, this was four or
                    five months later. They had a tap on our telephone which they were quite open
                    about at the consulate. Perhaps they had taps on our home phone, we weren't
                    sure. We would exchange jokes, and he would have somebody tell him on Friday
                    what interesting did you get from the consulate, and he would make some joke
                    about that to me. He would say, “I see you were talking with so and so this
                    week. You have got to watch talking to him. We might throw you in jail with him
                    or something like that.”</p>
                <p>I told him the story one time about this incident with the two follower cars,
                    there were two people in the follow car. He said,” Mm, what did they tell you?”
                    “They didn't tell me anything.” “They didn't say anything, they didn't open
                    their mouths to you?” “That's right.” “Good he said, because that is what they
                    had in their report. I just wanted to make sure they weren't lying. They were
                    under strict orders not to speak to you at all.” Anyway, it was a reasonable
                    relaxed sort of an operation, and they figured out after a couple of months who
                    I was and my tail disappeared.</p>
                <p>Q: What were you getting from the man who was the deputy consul general and
                    anyone else when you first arrived about the Portuguese position in Mozambique,
                    where it was headed at that point? We are talking about 1965.</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: They thought it was limited and that the insurgency would grow. They
                    didn't know when, how long it would be before the insurgents took over. He had a
                    list, apocalyptic I would suppose. He was not as sanguine as his predecessor
                    Wright was about when this would take place. He thought it would be some time,
                    but he thought they would get stronger and take over. Now, my assignment was to
                    make the evaluation. I listened to that; I listened to a lot of other people; I
                    listened to a man named Domingo Saluca who was the principal, he described
                    himself as the black showpiece of Mozambique. He was quite open in talking in
                    his office with a little man serving coffee, not a black of course. He ran a
                    newspaper published in Sangni and Aronga, the two principal southern Mozambique
                    languages. They had another I think, Macure language, I'm not sure. Anyway
                    another language newspaper which he owned and published. He was a lawyer. He was
                    really our only black opposition contact in Lourenco Marques because he was the
                    only one around. He wasn't in jail or under very tight cover.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>The agency had some others, but most of our contacts with the black opposition,
                    the essentially Frelimo opposition, there was one other small group as I said,
                    was from a source out of country. I would call on Laruca, I made several calls
                    on him. He would talk quite openly, “Yes it is inevitable that Frelimo is going
                    to take over, but what I would like to have would be a peaceful transfer of
                    power.” I would say, “Should we be talking like this here in this office?” I
                    would never call him on the telephone other than to set things up because I
                    didn't want to compromise anybody. They did throw people in jail for this sort
                    of thing. He said, “No, they would not touch me; I am their black showcase.” I
                    would say a month after that conversation, after I had been there about three or
                    four months, Laruca was arrested and spent the rest of the time I was in
                    Mozambique in the Cape Verde Islands where they had a prison. I never had any
                    contact after he left there with Domingo Laruca. His wife was a white
                    Portuguese, and I did occasionally see her before she left Mozambique and
                    inquire about Domingo Laruca, but he was not as untouchable as he thought.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, just to get a little flavor of the times, in later years the human
                    rights became to the forefront, you would have been protesting this type of
                    thing. I take it that how we dealt with a matter like this was not to protest.
                    It was a strictly internal Portuguese business, was that it?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: As I recall in Washington when charges would be made that such and such
                    an individual had been tortured. Torture, incidentally was not, it's hard to
                    [establish]. There were allegations that people had been tortured. They
                    certainly did use rough interrogation, and there probably was some of it. I
                    don't think a person like Laruca, in fact his wife never, claimed that he had
                    been tortured as I recall. He was a lawyer for crying out loud. He had been
                    educated in the Portuguese system; he was married to a white Portuguese woman.
                    He was arrested for contacts with active insurgency and supporting the
                    insurgency; and let's face it, he did have contacts with them. Our reporting
                    indicated that obviously he had contact with them, and he was fairly open. So, I
                    don't recall any protests. We would not have been involved in any protest in
                    Mozambique in any event because we after all, were a consulate general, although
                    actively reporting. We were not a position. Let me, well, I suppose it would be
                    of interest to find out what I did because my assignment was to investigate. So,
                    I arranged to go up. I could travel essentially wherever I wanted to. I had to
                    let the Portuguese know.</p>
                <p>I traveled all over Mozambique, up into the insurgency areas, because at this
                    time the active insurgency areas, bombs in the road, ambushes of military
                    patrols, that sort of thing was up in an area within 60-100 miles of the
                    Tanzania border. There were some little occasionally terrorist incidents down in
                    a part of Southern Mozambique, not in the city of Lourenco Marques, but those
                    were very small scale stuff. So I went up there; I made several trips. I
                    chartered a plane for one trip after six months or so after the new consul
                    general got there, Harold Reed. Henry Clinton Reed, who came from being consul
                    general in Angola for the previous two years. Prior to that, he had been consul
                    general in Au Porto. He was a long time Foreign Service officer. As I recall he
                    had been at the founding conference of the United Nations in San Francisco. He
                    had been a consular officer for a long time; son of a missionary.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Anyway, I went up and made these trips, and I believe even before we had arrived
                    I had made my reports and analysis, and Lachimeer had signed off on them. He
                    said well, you've been up. I think he even went on a couple of these trips
                    because he was also tied to orientation. I don't remember whether I made such a
                    trip with Al Lachimeer but I may have.</p>
                <p>My conclusion was that the Portuguese could defend Mozambique from being taken
                    over by Frelimo, if they had the national will to do so. But it would cost them
                    something. Unlike Angola which was a net economic plus, Mozambique was a net
                    economic loss. Not nearly as much of a loss as Portuguese Guinea. They would
                    certainly defend Mozambique as long as they defended Portuguese Guinea. They
                    were losing more people in Portuguese Guinea and Portuguese Guinea had no worth
                    for them at all except if they gave up Portuguese Guinea, that would give great
                    encouragement to the Mozambique rebels which was marginally important and more
                    important to the Angola rebels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Portuguese Guinea is in the bulge of Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: West Africa, Guinea Bissau it is called now. Angola was the gem of the
                    Portuguese overseas provinces. But anyway, that was the conclusion that I had
                    and the reason, the basic rationale, had Mozambique been a mosaic of tribes,
                    lots of little tribes, or had there been relatively little tribal identity, then
                    the insurgency supported from bases from countries primarily in Tanzania could
                    have probably swept down and taken the northern part of Mozambique and maybe
                    just kept on going, but there was a big problem.</p>
                <p>The principal insurgent fighters were Macombi, a warlike tribe, the best wood
                    carvers in east Africa which was about half in southern Tanzania and half in
                    Mozambique. Right south of them there was a tribe on the far west who did [get
                    outside] support, but not entirely. But the largest tribe in Mozambique was the
                    Macua. The Macua were traditional old tribal enemies of the Macombi. So here are
                    the Macombi supporting the Macua and vice versa. The Macua for that reason
                    remained essentially in the Portuguese camp. They were not generally active
                    participants in the insurgency. They formed a large buffer, a large block to the
                    southern spread of the insurgency. That was a large part of my analysis, and I
                    must say in retrospect, my analysis was pretty correct.</p>
                <p>The Portuguese did beat the insurgency at a tolerable level. They lost more
                    people from traffic accidents while I was there for example, than they did from
                    actual insurgent attacks. The reason being largely insurgents'. The main weapon
                    of the insurgents were little plastic anti-personnel land mines which they would
                    plant in the road. The Portuguese found that if you put sandbags in a jeep, and
                    if you ran the jeep like a bat out of hell, just as fast as you could go, that
                    the land mine would be set off by the jeep, but it would explode behind the jeep
                    and it wouldn't really bother anybody. So, they lost hardly anybody from vehicle
                    explosions.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>They did lose some from stepping on land mines, of course. But, mostly because
                    the culture was to speed very rapidly over those land mines, they did lose a lot
                    of people to traffic accidents. I went on some of those jeep rides over a lot of
                    those roads. I never had a land mine explode behind me, but they did drive just
                    like demons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Portuguese army at that
                        time, anhow were they dealing with the insurgency and attitudes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Their principal weapon they had, which the United States got terribly
                    interested in when I reported it, was fortified villages. This was early Vietnam
                    time. So, after I had made my reports and made my analysis of what was going to
                    happen, the fortified villages were generally successful. I don't think any of
                    the fortified villages fell as I recall, once they were properly fortified with
                    some land mines around them and some fences, and this, that and the other. They
                    would pick off people they would find out from grabbing some people and
                    interrogating them who were the principal Portuguese collaborators in the
                    village, and then when those people came out to go to their fields or what have
                    you, they would try to pick them off, so they did get some of the black Africans
                    in the village who were the principal collaborators or what have you. The
                    Africans would go outside of the village every day, largely unescorted to farm
                    because after all the farming areas were outside the village.</p>
                <p>We visited quite a few of those fortified villages and recorded how they were set
                    up and so on. Fairly successful, the majority of the people just wanted to be
                    left alone and do their own thing. The villages seemed to have adequate food;
                    mostly they grew their own food. It was by and large not trucked in, but if
                    there were some exceptionally bad - let's say the insurgents destroyed the crops
                    - the Portuguese military would bring in food from other areas. It was very hard
                    to gauge the opinion of a person in the village; I think it depended on his
                    tribal affiliation. Most of them did not speak any Portuguese, and most of us at
                    the Embassy didn't speak any tribal language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Portuguese army and how
                        ioperated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: With reasonable efficiency; they were spread fairly thin. I'm trying to
                    remember the number, 40,000 sticks in my mind, but I think that may have been
                    more than there were there. There were certainly no more than 40,000 Portuguese
                    troops in Mozambique, and after all we are talking of a country considerably
                    larger than California. Most of them were obviously concentrated in the
                    insurgent areas, but reasonably efficient. They were fairly well-supplied.
                    Portugal was a member of NATO so they got some U.S. supplies through NATO. There
                    was an agreement which the United States insisted on that they not use any of
                    those supplies in Mozambique. Now we were not trained military people.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>A military attach� may have come to Mozambique at one time while I was there; I
                    don't remember. Any obvious U.S. equipment we would report on, and I recall the
                    small amount that we say, and we would talk with the Portuguese military about
                    is this causing a problem. Well of course, Americans supporting the bloody
                    guerrillas and that sort of thing by not letting us use the equipment here. That
                    all appeared to be equipment that was acquired prior to any U.S. restrictions
                    and prior to any insurgency that had broken out. It didn't look as though they
                    were bringing that stuff down. After all we were not supplying them with
                    equipment, they had a small munitions industry. The sort of equipment they
                    needed in Mozambique that we were apt to see at least was generally not the sort
                    we would supply.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: No, not at all.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you get information about the rebellion? Could you talk a bit about
                    your impression of how the CIA, the agency representative, were you getting a
                    picture. Or was this sort of off your radar?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: A mix, a real mix. We talked with a lot of people, some people who had
                    business interests in the north, some people who were connected with the
                    Portuguese opposition, that is the metropolitan Portuguese opposition, white
                    Portuguese, but who didn't like the government and would like to come in and
                    tell us anything negative about the government. I don't mean necessarily come
                    into the office and tell us, but who we would meet and have lunch with, we would
                    run into them at some commercial activity or some reception or wherever. We
                    would go to shop or dealing with some lawyer on some local real estate matter,
                    all sorts of sources on that kind of information. We would call on people when
                    we would travel. If there was a local newspaper in the provincial area where you
                    would go, you would always call on the local newspaper editor who may not have
                    been a supporter of the Portuguese and people you would run into in hotels, you
                    would see a lot of it yourself. We did travel around in a lot of these areas,
                    and after my first couple of months there, and I'm not sure I made a trip North
                    during my first couple of months; I may have. I did not have a tail on me, so I
                    could wander around.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>You could always run into a lot of people in the slightly urban areas, not out in
                    the bush, who did speak Portuguese. You have to remember there were roughly
                    120,000 white Portuguese in Mozambique at the time, most of whom you would
                    almost call peasant farmers, some large agricultural cooperatives up in the
                    Limpopo valley where they tried to have sort of transformed Portuguese dirt
                    farmers to Mozambique. This had mixed economic success, some success, but they
                    couldn't really compete with the Africans from the standpoint of the wage scale.
                    I think, as I recall, there were about 8-10 million which is the population of
                    Mozambique of whom about 120,000 were white Portuguese. I would say about half
                    of them there as farmers or businessmen or what have you, and the other half
                    there in some government capacity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the agency officer have any good sources from your
                        point oview from the insurgency?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Had some. I would say that they were no better than my sources. Don't
                    forget, he did some cover work; he talked to some of the same sources I talked
                    with. He was, after all, listed as a political officer, as was I. So, we talked
                    with many of the same people. We took some trips together. Occasionally he would
                    go off to a bar or to prowl around town, obviously to meet a contact. But he
                    didn't have sources out in the [hinterland?], as I recall; that wasn't the sort
                    of thing we did. The main advantage was the reporting we got both agency and
                    State Department from outside the country which we would see, and of course we'd
                    share this. Then once we got a new Consul General, Harry Clinton Reed, had a
                    good memory for what the contacts would say, and he was a real sociable person
                    toward the contacts. Having served a couple of years at Au Porto, one of the
                    centers of Portuguese domestic opposition, and having served in Angola, he knew
                    the language well. He had a lot of contacts and friends of friends that he knew
                    and were living in Mozambique, so he would get all sorts of information. He
                    hated to write. We would get together in his office almost every morning and he
                    would tell me so and so said this and said that and you ought to see so and so
                    about something. More of my domestic Lourenco Marques information came from him,
                    rather than from my own direct contacts.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you feel any pressure both from these bifurcated bosses that you had, the
                    Europeans and NATO elements? The main thing for Portugal is we wanted to keep
                    the Azores base which was essential to NATO and we didn't want to rock the boat,
                    that was the European context. Then you had the Soapy Williams coterie in the
                    Africa Bureau which saw the winds of change and was quite positive on African
                    independence. These two collided, and here you are down in a place which is a
                    point of conflict and what you are sending out. I mean, nobody is going to be
                    happy if you send the wrong thing. Did you feel any of that?</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: We felt the difference between the bureaus, no question about that, and
                    I recall somebody on the political side from the Africa Bureau, maybe more than
                    one, did come for a visit to the post. Soapy Williams never came to Mozambique;
                    it would have been a little awkward. Anyway he never did come. Yes, we felt that
                    the Africa Bureau was not all that happy with our reporting, with the slant of
                    our reporting. We reported that the Portuguese could hold on as long as they
                    wanted to provided that they had the will to hold on which is what happened.
                    There was a revolution in Portugal and the leftist group of military took over.
                    They invited Frelimo in and said set it up. Frelimo at the time we were there
                    was not the radical leftist group they became after Eduardo Mondlane was
                    assassinated. As I recall, the assassination took place while we were in
                    Mozambique. Of course Frelimo said the Portuguese did it. I think it was an
                    internal Frelimo dispute between a radical element and the Eduardo Magline
                    element. Most of the time I was there Magline was... Laruca was freed from
                    prison after the revolution came on, maybe before that, I don't recall, and
                    later became associated with Renamo which was set up by the Rhodesian
                    government, the Ian Smith government and was later supported by the South
                    African government. I don't know what ever happened to Laruca but he was the
                    only respectable figure in the Renamo hierarchy, all the others being real goons
                    and that sort of thing. Renamo didn't even exist while I was there.</p>
                <p>Q: What about we were in the middle of the cold war and were always looking for
                    the Russian or Soviet bear under the bed or even the Communist Chinese. Were we
                    looking for Communist influence and what did we find?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Way down there we weren't particularly looking for it. There was little
                    Communist influence in Mozambique. Some of the opposition Portuguese perhaps had
                    communist ties, but we really didn't focus on that, and I'm not sure that any
                    had really serious communist ties that were in Mozambique. The Portuguese P.D.
                    would have come down and arrested anyone they thought had really serious
                    communist ties among the white Portuguese in Mozambique. Among the Frelimo as I
                    said was Laruca who certainly did not have communist ties. He did have Frelimo
                    ties from the Magline stripe that element of Frelimo. Now obviously the
                    Communist Chinese were supplying Frelimo I think gratis with all this
                    anti-personnel plastic mines. They were armed by, well their arms support came
                    from a variety of sources, the Chinese particularly and probably the Russians
                    were a major element in their source of arms and funding up in Tanzania, but
                    that was understood. After all, you take it from where you can get it. The
                    Tanzanian government also gave them considerable support of course.</p>
                <p>Q: You left there in 1967. Again at that time the Portuguese were in control and
                    as you said the feeling was as long as they had the will, they could hang
                    on.</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: And they did for some years after that. I don't remembewhen the leftist
                    revolution took place.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was mid-'70s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: And the situation on the ground in Mozambique at that time was just
                    about as it was when we left with the insurgency still going on, not much
                    different.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go then in 1967?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I went back to the Department, but let me mention just one thing before
                    because I neglected it. It was an important element of our activity there. That
                    was UDI, Unilateral Declaration of Independence by Rhodesia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you explain what UDI meant.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Certainly. UDI, Ian Smith who was the Premier or Prime Minister of
                    Rhodesia was faced with strong British pressure to bring black Africans into the
                    government and to evolve into a multi-racial society which would inevitably mean
                    eventually a predominant role for black Africans. He elected, and the principal
                    white elements of the Rhodesian population elected, to unilaterally declare
                    independence which nobody recognized except South Africa. Rhodesia's principal
                    entry, for entry and egress of goods has through Mozambique, was through the
                    port of Berra and the port of Lourenco Marques. There was supposed to be an
                    embargo which South Africa said up front they weren't going to do it, on such
                    things to and from Rhodesia.</p>
                <p>The Department of State was quite interested in what was still flowing through
                    Berra and Lourenco Marques. Both the agency, the CIA, and we were sort of tasked
                    with trying to look for that sort of thing. I remember we looked at cargo in the
                    port and we'd go in and inspect things in the port. One thing in particular,
                    there was a particular type of iron pellet from Polabora which was up in
                    Rhodesia. Before UDI I had been all around the port; I went everywhere and
                    looked at this, that, and the other. and, oh, yes, Polabora iron ore. You could
                    tell because the pellets were a certain type, size and grade. That is the iron
                    ore from South Africa because it looks different. After the UDI, I went down to
                    the port some time after and there was a bunch of this Polabora Rhodesian iron
                    ore. “No, No, that is South African iron ore.” “Well, it is Rhodesian iron ore.”
                    We did our report back to the Department. It was going to Japan. The Department
                    of State complained to the Japanese through the embassy or in Washington. The
                    Japanese came back, “Oh, absolutely not. This is South African iron ore; here
                    are the origin documents.” Of course the origin documents did say, South
                    African. “Here is a report from our engineers. There is no way to tell one from
                    the other; they look identical,” and so on. We have to assume this is correct.
                    There is absolutely no way we can tell whether this is or isn't. Of course they
                    could, and the Japanese were lying through their teeth and the Department, well,
                    what could you say? The State Department could perhaps arrange for some iron
                    experts to go in and inspect it; this, that, and the other, but it never
                    happened.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you went back to the Department in 1967; where did
                        you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: That's right. I went to a job in personnel. I was career management
                    officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were a career management officer, known as a Schmoe
                        (CMO)back in the old days. You were in personnel from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: From '67-'69.</p>
                <p>Q: Could you explain how the Foreign Service operated, not just the political
                    officers, but all, the role of personnel at that time, and what you were
                    doing?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: By this time I had become, as I clearly had wanted to be, a political
                    cone officer. I was managing the careers of political cone officers more or less
                    in my grade. I think I started on FSO [classes] 6 and 5. The 7s and 8s were
                    taken care of by the Junior Officers program. I think it was 6s and 5s and I may
                    have managed 4s for a little while. Oh, yes, I was promoted to 4 at that time.
                    After about two years in Mozambique I was now an FSO-4 which is sort of like an
                    Army major.</p>
                <p>What would I do? I did not assign officers. I interviewed them. I looked over
                    their records. I tried to plot a logical, in consultation with the officer
                    (largely when they came in for consultation, career sequence of assignments. Get
                    a career plan approved, and then we had to sign off on officer assignments. If
                    it was a field, normally we (CMOs) lost. The geographic bureaus would usually
                    win. We would project a course and if an officer is assigned outside that
                    projection then in theory at least we could complain, and we did complain in
                    fact that this made no career development sense. We tried to do it logically so
                    that if an officer was strong in one thing or another or had a strong motivation
                    in a particular thing and some qualifications, could get the assignment. We had
                    mixed success in that. Some officers I think we were substantial in getting them
                    assignments that made sense and they were developed into better officers than
                    they would if we had not been there.</p>
                <p>Q: At one point we [I was assigned there also, as a CMO] were developing a tool,
                    which I guess has lapsed, but [it graphically] gave an idea where to get the
                    maximum value out of officers, and develop them. This was the pre-computer age.
                    We were actually using punch and a knitting needle. It worked. But, one could
                    have done a much better analysis on this to figure out what we had in a
                    stockpile of officers and where there were gaps and weaknesses. I mean it would
                    have been an attempt to manage manpower more than just a way to promote people
                    and assign people each on an individual basis with no attempt to look on an
                    overall basis as to where are they going [or needed].</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yes, there was a weakness there in that mostly it was done individually
                    which would be very easy now that you have computers. It could have been done
                    better even back then. The career projections five years out into the future,
                    say that we are going to have twice as many people in political positions as we
                    need and not as many people in consulate. That [revealed] big weakness [in
                    future staffing].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was an early attempt to try to get a feel for that.
                        What wayour impression of the officer cadre you were seeing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: It varied tremendously of course. Some of them should have been hustled
                    out of the Foreign Service, but not too many. Most of them were probably
                    overqualified for the jobs they were doing. I would say this in most of the
                    cones. They could have probably been hastened along more rapidly than our
                    projections had been going because our projections had to be sort of realistic.
                    I mean we couldn't have projected an officer of my grade for example to be an
                    ambassador on his second post. Well, as a new FSO-4 you could have gotten a tiny
                    ambassadorship but it would have been highly unlikely. You had to project it if
                    you thought there was the potential for maybe three or four assignments. A lot
                    of those officers could have taken an ambassador job but I would say at level.
                    If they had the proper projection, a DCM [would have been more realistic]. We
                    weren't developing them to their maximum. Some of the real hotshots, they
                    developed. (Static obliteration of program) Sometimes we'd protest that some of
                    these officers who could do the job well, didn't move along as rapidly as some
                    of these other guys.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: To the Latin American studies course. I had my pick of the

                    a university training of a year at a masters program of university studies. I
                    picked Stanford University and went to Stanford. The best program, and I knew it
                    at the time for what I was interested in, was at the University of Texas. But I
                    had lived in California when I was in the army earlier, actually down in
                    Monterey. I liked the Palo Alto area and it was a good program.</p>

                <p>MATTHEWS: I was one of, as I recall, 12 students in a masters program in Latin
                    American studies, an interdisciplinary program. I was the oldest, in my mid-30s.
                    I was making about the same salary as a good friend of mine who was an associate
                    professor, in this particular case, anthropology. Obviously I was a little
                    better off than the rest of the students. I had three kids, one of whom was in
                    second grade, one of whom was in kindergarten. The other was pre school. My wife
                    was not employed at the time other than looking after the kids. We rented a
                    house on Hanover Street just off the campus, about two blocks from the campus,
                    so I was a little better than most of my fellow students. My fellow students
                    included Rick Muchio who as you know is engaged over at NSC in Latin American
                    studies now or Latin American affairs. I'm not sure whether he is still there; I
                    can't remember the names of the others now; Rick Martinez, who is head of some
                    Mexican-American institute; and several others. One went on before the end of
                    the year into the local insane asylum. He just cracked up and broke down. I
                    didn't find it that stressful. In fact, I found the course work a lost easier
                    than my undergraduate work at the University of North Carolina. Stanford is a
                    tough place to get into, which I, of course, didn't have to. The entry was sort
                    of guaranteed. But, once you got there, you could sort of work at your own pace
                    and the grades you got depending on the work you devoted to it were probably
                    easier than the work at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Johnnie
                    Johnson was the head of the program. I grew a beard while I was there; the first
                    time I had grown a beard. I didn't do it for camouflage, for the counter-campus
                    Vietnam. I did it because I thought it was something I would like. I had one
                    like this. It turned out red. Yes, there were some protests and there were some
                    counter-protests. There was a conservative movement on campus, and there were
                    anti-Vietnam protests. There were some protests that would get involved with
                    Latin American policy.</p>
                <p>Most of my colleagues, the twelve, but not all of the Latin American studies
                    people that I have run into who were interested in Latin America were highly
                    critical of our Latin American policy. They felt that we shouldn't be supporting
                    the radicals; we should be supporting another group than the governments. I
                    tried to impress on them that, look, we as a government, deal with governments.
                    We deal with governments as they are. We try to change the government by various
                    persuasive tactics, if it gets a tough enough, situation by sanction. We are not
                    just trying to change the government. We also have a cold war on, and we
                    support, in effect, those who support us. If somebody is attacking us
                    constantly, we are not that happy with it as a government. But there are all
                    sorts of elements within our government as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>I recall one fellow named Richard Fagin. He was a professor at the time, wrote on
                    Cuba mainly, had a number of interviews with Fidel Castro; that sort of thing.
                    But he was highly open and approachable. He asked me to take one of his graduate
                    seminars one day. I recall I was talking about U.S. policy toward Latin America
                    and giving the rationale, this that and the other. I saw one fellow dressed in
                    fatigues and combat boots of this group of 10 or 15 sitting around the table. He
                    just could not contain himself. I was seated there; I think I had on very
                    informal clothes. After all, I was a student, beard and all that. He jumped up
                    on the table standing right in front of me, towering over me and said, “I have
                    heard all this bullshit and crap. I can't take, etc.” I said, “Calm down, why
                    don't you. Sit down and let's talk about it.” I continued on.</p>
                <p>Later I accused Dick Fagin, “You set me up.” He had left the room. I expected him
                    to stay there. I also conducted other seminars while I was there and in all
                    those others, the professor stayed in the room. Dick Fagin left it. Dick and I
                    had other disagreements about Cuban policy as well. I remember at one point
                    accusing him of prostituting his... Well, he had to do it to maintain access to
                    Cuba to do it. “Well, in your writing, if all you are doing is maintaining your
                    access, you are prostituting your academic credentials. He didn't quite agree
                    with me. Well, we had a few talks like that.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you feel there was any particular thrust to the Latin American department?
                    You talk about the students and one professor. Of course, Stanford also had the
                    Hoover Institute which was very conservative.</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: We had a Foreign Service officer assigned to the HooveInstitute for
                    academic reasons like myself while I was out there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel any thrust toward those?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: A mixed bag, more critical than supportive by and large. Our little
                    Latin American studies institute, or whatever it was, was an interdisciplinary
                    thing. Johnnie Johnson was the only person - he was also a professor of history
                    - the only person who was assigned to our [group], there were a number of other
                    professors who focused on Latin America who were affiliated with it in some way,
                    but their prime affiliation was to their department. They were either a
                    professor of political science, history, anthropology, or whatever. I took a mix
                    of courses out there, including a core seminar each semester or quarter. I
                    believe they had quarters then, I don't remember. You did take one core seminar,
                    and the others were electives that focused on Latin America. All my courses had
                    something to do with Latin America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in the summer of 1970?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I had been told, when I consulted with Personnel before I left and when
                    I came back, that I was a sure fire promotee to FSO-3 and would take over the
                    political section of some Latin American country. Now, I did not have good
                    Spanish; I had passable Spanish. I had never been trained by the State
                    Department. I had to take a master's qualification exam. I took that in
                    Portuguese, not Spanish. I had never been assigned to a Spanish speaking
                    country, and I wanted assignment to a Spanish speaking country. I knew they had
                    an eight week transition course, or maybe it was a six week course at that time
                    from Portuguese to Spanish, and I wanted to have that.</p>
                <p>Well, I wasn't promoted; I was still FSO-4. I said, “Well, can I get one of these
                    jobs posted to Central America?” The trouble was they were anticipating my
                    promotion and said they had filled these jobs. I said,”Why? They fiddled around
                    and said, “Well, how about State Department political officer in Trinidad and
                    Tobago?” I said, “That is really Latin America. After a year of training at
                    Stanford that is what I had been training for?” I hadn't even focused on the
                    English speaking Caribbean. I did do a paper on it once upon a time in that
                    ill-fated mid-career course I had after Brazil. I recommended that we invite the
                    Russians in to take over Haiti, and said its is the only solution I could see.
                    Dump it in their laps. The Department didn't quite buy off on that. It was some
                    academic exercise anyway, let's face it.</p>
                <p>I did talk to Wilton Bural about that, he had written a paper, but not that. He
                    said, “That might be the only way.” Anyway, it ended up where I went. By way of
                    training. I wouldn't really call it training. It was more of orientation,
                    talking with the AFL-CIO, because I was political-labor officer there, and
                    handled both ends of things. Interesting things, I met George Meany and all the
                    other AFL-CIO, but it was purely orientation, purely talking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Trinidad-Tobago from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: 1970. I got there several months after the mutiny which was the epochal
                    political event of the time. Where the unsuccessful mutiny of officers (some
                    were sincere but most were self-serving), which Eric Williams then Prime
                    Minister and his group had successfully put down, largely because they had no or
                    very little support. I left in '72. I was there exactly two years October
                    '70-October '72.</p>
                <p>Q: Could you talk first a bit about the embassy and who was the ambassador and
                    what were American interests as defined during this '70-'72 period.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: The ambassador when I arrived and during the first year I was there was
                    Whythe Symington. He had run for congress from Maryland. He was a conservative
                    Republican. I last saw him about 10 days ago when he stopped by our place up in
                    Newport just for a visit of five minutes, no more. We've kept in touch. I have
                    kept in touch with a lot of people over the years, some of the political
                    appointees not. The main problem as I told Harry Clinton Reed later on, was that
                    all my immediate bosses, with one exception, had died. Reed is now dead, too, of
                    course, but Symington is still around. One year he was there, and then Anthony
                    Marshall replaced him, also a political appointee.</p>
                <p>It was customary that political appointees went to Trinidad and Tobago back in
                    those days. One of the reasons was (A) it was an English language post; (B) U.S.
                    interests were limited in those areas. When I arrived we had a missile tracking
                    station which was still in operation. It was the northern part of an old navy
                    base. It was run technically under the Air Force but it was a missile tracking
                    station.</p>
                <p>We had Texaco, a major oil producer by Caribbean standards, not by world
                    standards; Amoco; and I think another oil company which came in, I think while I
                    was there, and developed offshore oil production. Reynolds Aluminum imported
                    bauxite from Guyana and did some additional processing and trans-shipping from
                    Trinidad and Tobago.</p>
                <p>The population was only about a million people. Nonetheless, we had significant -
                    it is hard to say significant - we has some exports of interest and export
                    potential, but most of the exports as I recall were connected with the petroleum
                    industry.</p>
                <p>Q: During the two years you were there '70-'72 could you describe the government?
                    Eric Williams was an interesting person and how we dealt with - his approach to
                    us - and how the Ambassadors dealt with him; also how you went about your
                    work.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Eric Williams was an authoritarian individual but it was a democratic
                    society. I would not call it a dictatorship in any way, shape or form;
                    definitely democratic. They would say what they damn well wanted to say and
                    nobody would arrest them for saying what they wanted to say. The people who led
                    the mutiny were in jail of course. They were tried and most were convicted. The
                    ringleaders were convicted; the rest were expelled from the military, and some
                    might have even been reintegrated; I'm not sure. It was an extremely small
                    military; they didn't even have a navy, they had a coast guard. Williams was the
                    undisputed leader. No he wasn't undisputed. There was a dispute for the
                    leadership of the People's National Movement which was the ruling party. The
                    principal opposition party was East Indian dominated. The PM was Black
                    dominated. The two races were almost equal in terms of population in Trinidad
                    and Tobago. The mulatto element was primarily black-white mix, although some
                    black-Indian mix made up the difference. That was a fairly substantial group of
                    people. We are talking maybe about 20% of the population and some Chinese and
                    what have you. Unlike in Guyana where I later served, demographically the blacks
                    and the part-blacks had a majority of the population. The PM had that. A.N.R.
                    Roberts, who had been the Deputy Prime Minister, Eric Williams thought had
                    encouraged the mutiny so he didn't trust his loyalty. So he fell from the party.
                    He organized his own relatively small political group because he was from Tobago
                    with a population of, oh, maybe 30,000 or so - a small population, therefore a
                    small population base. It never really amounted to a great deal. He was younger
                    and was considered more leftist than Eric Williams.We had relations with them
                    all. We had no big deal. I think the man's name, I can't remember his name, the
                    head of the East Indian party. I got to know him fairly well; an old man. I
                    attended his funeral pyre. He was Hindu and a pyre was built and he was
                    cremated; that sort of thing. We had relations all over. We had very good
                    relations with all the labor elements there. I submitted, well I had to submit
                    reports. In fact the Waterfront workers, as I recall, one of the ways I
                    impressed myself because they kept bringing it up, was that I drank them under
                    the table at one sort of meeting we had. They invited me to some sort of
                    meeting. They had an assistance program for the trade unions through the labor
                    development arm of the AFL-CIO down there. We had an AFL officer who was
                    assigned there. He was from the steelworkers union in Maryland and he was a
                    trade unionist essentially, a black fellow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our feeling about Eric Williams and how did he
                        deal witSymington and the next Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Very ambivalent. Eric Williams had lived in the United States at one
                    time; he knew the United States fairly well. He suffered some racial
                    discrimination in the United States which he never forgot. He was mixed; he was
                    not pure black. He was well-educated. He felt himself far superior to almost
                    anybody else on the island, regardless of his race. And he didn't hide this
                    feeling of superiority. He may have been superior. Certainly he was a good
                    political tactician.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>His relations with the embassy were not all that open. I would cover the
                    legislature sometimes. Inevitably he would send a note over that he would want
                    to see me about something, and I would hope that he would want to see me about
                    some political development or this, that or the other. Inevitably it was someone
                    who would like to have a visa to the United States; can you arrange this and so
                    on. This is on the floor of Parliament which met regularly. But I had contacts
                    all over, including with a number of the trade unions.Illustrative, one of the
                    trade union chiefs, he was also a senator had a farewell reception for me at his
                    home. All the senior the waterfront workers union gave a little reception for me
                    down at the union hall and several others. But, he had one at his home. Then he
                    said, “After this we all want to come down to the hotel and see you before you
                    leavWhere are you going to be staying?” I said, “The Trinidad Hilton for the
                    last couple of nights after we had moved out of our house.” There was a Prime
                    Ministers conference taking place actually at the Trinidad Hilton, part of it at
                    least there, from the English speaking Caribbean. Carl had not come. I thought,
                    well, you say a lot of things at a reception. About ten or eleven o'clock PM,
                    the day before we were leaving the next morning to take a plane out. We had
                    packed up and all that sort of thing, of course. Betty had already gone to bed
                    and the kids were in their respective rooms. We had a suite. The way to get into
                    the suite, oddly as I recall, was through the bedrooms. I don't remember the
                    logistics, but it was that way. To get into the living part you had to go
                    through the bedroom. Betty and the kids were in the bedroom, and I got a call,
                    Carl Tull saying, “I'm coming down to say good-by to you. I told you I was
                    coming and I'm on my way.” I said, “Carl the family is in bed now.” He said,
                    “Well, I'm coming down anyway.” I said, “Okay, fine, I'm delighted to see you.
                    Come on down. You will have to pardon my wife, she is in bed already and may not
                    want to get up.” He said, “That is all right. I'm bringing a couple of people
                    with me.” I said, “Who?” “Michael Mannling and Forbes Brenner. Ministers of
                    Jamaica.” And down goes the phone. We got our clothes on and there was a knock
                    on the door which was the bedroom door. Betty said she was going to feign sleeSo
                    I escorted these two Prime Ministers and Carl Tull, and they stayed a very short
                    time. But I told Forbes Brenner later when I was assigned to Guyana and frequent
                    Charg� and DCM, “You remember where we first met?” “No.” “In the Hotel.” “Oh,
                    yes! I remember that.” Anyway that is illustrative of the informality of
                    Trinidad.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Fyfe Symington run the embassy and what was
                        hirelationship with Eric Williams?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Stiff. Eric Williams thought he had racial prejudice whether he did or
                    not, and he never really got over that. On the other hand Fyfe had been a strong
                    supporter of a spirited U.S. reaction against the mutiny, and Eric Williams as a
                    tactician liked that.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>One of the issues that came up while we were there was Chinese representation. As
                    I recall, we still recognized Nationalist China and he made a spirited case that
                    Trinidad should not switch representation to the PRC. They did switch
                    representation to the PRC. He took this badly and let it be known that he took
                    it badly. Eric Williams didn't appreciate that. He left not because the
                    Trinidadians said they wanted him out; he left just because he, he was a fairly
                    wealthy individuaHis wife was one of the heirs to the Mellon fortune. His son is
                    currently Governor of Arizona and having a few problems out there. He was a
                    nephew of Stuart Symington who is a senator from Missouri.</p>
                <p>He was replaced by Tony Marshall who was from a well-connected but not nearly as
                    wealthy family of good Republican credentials, a much younger person who ran the
                    embassy in a looser form. Fyfe for example one of the female officer a very
                    attractive officer who later on married a Guyanese, consular officer wore slacks
                    to the office a couple of times. He thought this was absolutely could not be
                    permitted, that she had to wear a dress. She took umbrage at that, and there was
                    a little tenseness, if you will, on that. Symington's analysis of how things
                    were doing in Trinidad was pretty much on the mark. He was not a high political
                    profile person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you left there in 1972 and whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: From there I then went back and had this finally, I was offered several
                    posts but because I was still an FSO-4. I had not been promoted. I thought my
                    career was going absolutely nowhere. So, I was only offered 04 type positions.
                    The best one that I could find was one of two labor positions, political-labor
                    officer positions because after all I had one. I tried to get a political
                    counselor position in Latin America. I wanted a Spanish speaking post,
                    absolutely, that was my sine qua non. I was offered political officer job at
                    Caracas and at Lima, Peru.</p>
                <p>I elected Lima, Peru because Rob McCormick was Ambassador to Caracas and Rob was,
                    had a habit of taking an instant like or dislike to a person. He had a favorable
                    impression of me at that time. But if he did take an instant dislike to you or
                    if you did something, you were on his black list from then on. I frankly just
                    did not want to serve in that sort of grinder, and so even though the job was
                    more interesting at Caracas, I took the one at Lima, Peru. I went by way of six
                    weeks conversion course to Spanish and then I went to Lima.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were in Lima from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: A year and a half, the shortest tour I ever had because I requested
                    transfer. Not because I didn't like the job but the job was, I thought, had to
                    be more interesting. I arrived there in January of '73 and left in June of
                    '74.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>Q: Let's talk about Peru. As usual, I'd like to talk a bit about the Embassy and
                    the Ambassador and how that worked. Then we will talk about the situation.</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Well, Lima was the first relatively large Embassy I had ever served in.
                    My first post back in Munich, Germany back in those days was a fairly large
                    post, but smaller than Lima. There in Lima, I was strictly labor.</p>
                <p>My title on the Foreign Service officers list was Political-labor, where in
                    Trinidad it had been at least half, I would say more than half, political as the
                    sole State political officer. Although there was another agency political
                    officer there who incidentally nobody ever picked as the agency person. He
                    played golf with the colonialists, that sort of thing. One amusing incident, let
                    me just go back to Trinidad because this is sort of amusing. There was a radical
                    leftist newspaper called The Bomb which was published by a radical leftist
                    Trinidadian politician of no particular importance. They had a front page expos�
                    after I had been there about six months and it said CIA chief in the Caribbean
                    identified. They had a quarter of the front page taken up with the bald shining
                    head of George Thompson, our public affairs officer whose views if anything are
                    a little left of center and still are. He was a newspaper correspondent, but the
                    reason they picked him as the CIA chief in the Caribbean were absolutely
                    impeccable. Just like he was the closest thing you could find to James Bond in
                    the Caribbean, with one exception. He was devoted to his wife. He had a wife
                    that looked older than he as a matter of fact, and one son. Really a good family
                    man. But, he had sailed his own yacht to Trinidad-Tobago. That is the way he
                    arrived. He traded his yacht while he was there for an airplane and he flew all
                    around the place. He was an accomplished pilot. He was a former newspaper man
                    and hung around the newspaper offices. He was not reticent about what he said,
                    so he would go to the Tribune, I think it was the Tribune, the more leftist of
                    the two papers, not radical leftist by any means. He'd say, “Christ sake look at
                    this here. You got the layout all wrong. Do it that way,” etc.</p>
                <p>He was an Arabist who had been to the Middle East. One of the big issues of the
                    time was Trinidad and Tobago joined OPEC. It was clear at the time that the
                    United States preferred that Trinidad and Tobago not join OPEC. He was a ham
                    radio operator. He was always on the ham radio. He drove the fastest most souped
                    up car on the island charging around the highways. As I said, he shaved his
                    head, bald head. All these things were James Bond of course, so this guy, the
                    idiot at the paper had that and these were the screaming headlines, “CIA chief
                    in the Caribbean identified.”</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>George left on reassignment about nine or ten months after that. We couldn't
                    decide who would replace George. Of course the CIA chiefs sat back and chortled
                    about this. George went up to him and said, “You put him up to this.”
                    “Absolutely not you are obviously the chief!” He was still there, but nobody was
                    going to finger him. Well, they looked around who is going to replace George.
                    Well, I didn't have a yacht and I didn't do this that or the other, but I did
                    have all these good contacts with the labor unions and the AIFLD man clearly
                    they thought took orders from me. Well, he did to an extent but not entirely.
                    His prime bosses were at the AFL-CIO. He was not CIA either, had no contacts. I
                    got a much more hesitant article. Only a quarter of a pageon the front page
                    saying new CIA chief in the Caribbean is Wade Matthews and so on. So I went up
                    and hailed the real CIA man and said, “You know, I believe you are putting him
                    up to this.”</p>
                <p>Okay, back to Peru. My job was purely labor there. Oh, not purely labor. I did
                    some political work. I talked with some journalists, this, that and the other,
                    but it was 75% labor there. I was supposed to follow the labor unions. There we
                    had political interests in where Peru went. In Peru at the time there was a
                    Nasserist regime. Juan Velasco Alvarado was the military dictator of Peru. He
                    fancied himself sort of as the Latin American equivalent of Nasser. Well,
                    Nasserism is now discredited, but at the time it wasn't completely discredited.
                    I guess that was probably the most leftist of the continental South American
                    regimes. I'm trying to think, well while I was there of course, Allende down in
                    Chile took over, and he was more leftist I suppose. Velasco Alvarado was
                    considered equally leftist, so the labor union was a field of political
                    competition. There was the CTP which was affiliated with AIFLD, the AFL-CIO
                    affiliated international movement. There was the CGTP which was communist
                    supported by the Soviet Union, affiliated with the world federation of trade
                    unions. There was the favored organ of this military Nasserist government, the
                    CTRP. My job was to report on how things were doing in labor which was
                    considered important to the political scene there, and to aid in effect the CTP
                    and to try to find out what was going on with and maybe even try to wean the
                    CTRP over to a more pro U.S. or pro democratic position. And I had contacts with
                    all three, but overwhelmingly with the CTP.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>Now the Aprista party which was the populist traditional party of Peru had strong
                    and close ties with the CTP, so as a result, I had some pretty good ties with
                    the Aprista party as well. That was maybe my political, well broadly speaking, a
                    fair amount of it was political. I attended all the CTP conventions; I attended
                    the CTRP convention. I met a couple of times with CTGP people. The AFL-CIO was
                    not happy with that at all. Nor was the Department entirely happy, but nobody
                    stopped me, at least these preliminary sounding out meetings. Truly a getting to
                    know you sort of thing, nothing more with CTGP. We had an AID program for
                    support of certain CTP functions. I think it was a housing program they had. We
                    had training programs for certain of the CTP people. I invited one of the CTRP
                    people; I can't remember whether he ever went. Well, that was what I did. Now to
                    who was there, Toby Belcher was the ambassador, a career ambassador, very
                    qualified most of the time I was there. I think Dick Clark was the DCM when I
                    arrived and Dick Barnaby, Malcolm Barnaby was the DCM toward the time I left.
                    Ray Gonzales was the head of the political section. He was my boss, my
                    performance report was reviewed by the DCM. Ray must have liked what I did, in
                    fact, he did like what I did. He invited me in the labor stage of my career when
                    he was ambassador to Ecuador if I would like to go down and serve as Consul
                    General at Guayaquil. It is a labor story.</p>
                <p>Q: Well now did you as you were dealing with this sort of interesting mix of
                    trade union organizations and as a labor officer how much did you feel the
                    AFL-CIO was calling the changes within the Department of State from your
                    perspective?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Certainly AFL-CIO had a strong if not predominant influence on U.S.
                    labor policy toward Latin America. The sort of thing I mentioned, the degree of
                    my contacts with CTRP and the pro government if you will down there the labor
                    element and the CGPT which they had an absolute boycott. Their rationale was
                    these are not legitimate trade unionists. These are communists, political
                    operators and the interest of the working man is put down. They had a strong
                    influence. I went by for a consultation with the AFL-CIO and with the AIFLD
                    which was run by a fellow named Bill Daugherty, good strong trade union
                    contacts. The people that I met at the point when I came back to Washington for
                    consultation would visit Peru. I would meet with them and share with them
                    things. I had no conflict with what they said except I did want to broaden my
                    contacts a little, and I was able to do that to the extent I felt necessary
                    without their strong approval. They would have clearly supported me for another
                    more important labor office position had I been inclined to continue that
                    route.</p>
                <p>Q: I imagine we were looking very closely and taking the temperature all the time
                    of this Nasserite dictatorship particularly because of the influence of the
                    Soviet Union in this. Did you see much of the Soviets influential there or was
                    this sort of a home grown thing?</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: No, they were quite influential because there was a large and active
                    communist party element in Peru, and some elements of the government,
                    particularly the Fisheries Minister at the time, and a Minister of National
                    Development felt some sort of socialism, not necessarily dominated by Moscow but
                    assisted by Moscow, was the way that Peru should go. It clearly would not be the
                    predominant view of the government which Peru should be technically equidistant
                    between the Soviet Union and the United States. But since this was the United
                    States' backyard, Peru voted overwhelmingly at the time with the Soviet Union at
                    the United Nations. Peru considered themselves a mainline element of the third
                    world bloc, if you will. They saw this depending on who it was, some saw it as a
                    method of staying in power. Their principle opponents were the Aprista party,
                    the populist party and the business elements who had other parties they
                    supported, not the radical left. They thought they could keep the radical left
                    under control, and they did clamp down on the real radical left which later
                    developed into the Sendero Luminosa.</p>
                <p>They would occasionally clamp down on the communists, but not much. They had sort
                    of a modus vivendi with the communists, and they allowed them to as long as they
                    didn't get too powerful, develop pretty much as they wanted to. The Soviet Union
                    had a large and active embassy who we had some contacts with incidentally. We
                    would depend on a diplomats club, sort of right below the Chief of Mission
                    level, and we would have lunches. I would usually try to sit beside some of the
                    Soviets, and we would have interesting conversations sometimes.</p>

                        Chile athat time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yes, I would say probably so. It was certainly of more interest in
                    Washington than what was happening in Peru. We were not far behind because,
                    don't forget, this Nasserist tendency in the military in Latin America, leftist
                    military regimes, there was a lot of support around the continent for that sort
                    of thing among the military elements of the countries.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved at all in nationalization? Was that a

                        property?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yes it was. There were a number of moves made toward southern Peru,
                    Southern Peru Copper. I think they did nationalize one of Southern Peru Copper's
                    operations while I was there. In the scheme of things, this is what was going to
                    happen if the regime had continued. One of the ways they had of encouraging
                    nationalization was through pressure from the labor unions. The labor unions in
                    southern Peru were CGTP or CTRP dominated. Therefore the regime, and also the
                    CGTP for their own reasons not for supporting the regime, both had a policy of
                    encouraging nationalization, confiscation I should say. They encouraged
                    confiscation. The CGTP wanted workers control and worker councils running it and
                    that sort of thing. The CTRP was quite satisfied since after all, they were on
                    the government dole, to let a government minister run it or a government
                    appointee run it.</p>
                <p>One thing I should mention before we get too deep in, I finally was promoted to
                    FSO-3 a few months after I arrived at Peru. I felt, as I knew I would feel, that
                    I really could do a little better from a career development standpoint in a DCM
                    job. So, I started sort of angling, after a reasonable period. The Department
                    said, “Absolutely no way are we going to pull you out even if somebody requests
                    you in less than a year. Don't even think about it until a year after you
                    arrive.” The year I arrived was January which is not the real DCM transfer
                    season, so we were really talking after a year and a half. I did request
                    consideration without angling with individual Ambassadors. I requested
                    consideration for a DCM job. I did eventually get one, but that is skipping
                    ahead.</p>
                <p>Q: On this confiscation thing, what line were you talking to the union people you
                    could talk to about what would be the results of a takeover by the Peruvian
                    government of the market?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Southern Peru Copper is a lot easier target to negotiate with, and they
                    don't have the power to oppose you that the government would have. With an
                    authoritarian government running the mines, the authoritarian government's
                    interests would be to keep labor under control. Labor's interests are not going
                    to be served by a government takeover. That would be the line I would take. Now
                    we are talking about a valid line to take.</p>
                <p>Q: Strictly during the time you were there, how did events in Chile play? There
                    were accusations that when Allende came in, very strong accusations that he was
                    overthrown by the CIA, at least the CIA was influential. In the first place did
                    you have any feel about activity, this was the high Nixon period who didn't look
                    happily on any leftist regime anywhere and particularly in Latin America. Did
                    you have any feel that we were messing around in Peru at the time?</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: No, we weren't really messing. I had no feel at least for our being
                    messing around to overthrow the government. We obviously wanted to know as much
                    about what was happening and what they were doing, who was supporting stronger
                    Russian influence, who was supporting a return to democracy if you will, that
                    sort of thing. As I said, I had good ties with the Aprista party while I was
                    there. I passed no money under the table to anyone. We had an open and above
                    board trade union program which the government tolerated. They didn't like it at
                    all, through AIFLD. Most of what we got from Chile were newspaper reports,
                    intelligence reports that we would read, and people passing through. Chilean
                    labor people, Peruvian and Chilean labor people who would go down to Chile, I
                    mean from my personal perspective, and I had contacts with them of course. The
                    AIFLD officer would go down for some things. I believe he may have also run an
                    AIFLD program in Chile, I don't know. That's my recollection; he certainly had
                    something to do with it. He would bring back reports of how things were, and it
                    was reports of a steadily deteriorating situation from a living standpoint, from
                    a standpoint of public order and this that and the other. We got the impression
                    that things were not going to go on too much longer that way. There was going to
                    be one of two things. There would be a leftist takeover perhaps supported by
                    Allende, probably supported by Allende, or there would be a revolution against
                    him or a civil war in Chile. Very few Peruvians we talked to were emulating
                    Chile; they were watching Chile cautiously. The military was also watching Chile
                    cautiously. If there were a revolution or a leftist victory, it would not be
                    supported by the Chilean military, and while they were not great friends with
                    the Chilean military, they nonetheless were military colleagues. The Velasco
                    regime looked askance at what was going on.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, if I recall, Allende was bypassing the military and creating his own
                    personal militia which I suppose would be anathema to the leaders in Peru.</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yes, they didn't like that at all, even the radical leftists. But they
                    felt - it is hard to say - there were all sorts of currents of opinion, but so
                    far as we could tell, the military felt that the way they were going would
                    guarantee against this sort of thing happening to them, what might happen to the
                    Chilean military.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you able to talk to people in the government, the military
                    government?</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I didn't personally talk to anybody. I never met Velasco for example. I
                    talked to the minister of labor on several occasions who was a military officer
                    of course. I think maybe one or two others of them but they were not really
                    substantive conversations. I met with the Minister of Labor on several occasions
                    because after all we had these AID programs that dealt with some of the trade
                    unions. I don't recall actually calling on any of the ministers. Don't forget, I
                    was down in the hierarchy there at that embassy. I traveled around Peru some.
                    There was one long trip Fred Romden and I took down to southerPeru right at the
                    time of the Chilean military takeover. I guess this was '73, wasn't it? My
                    memory is hazy on the date. Anyway we were in Atakeepna and we went down to
                    Taqua. We were just going to go over the border into Chile and see Akiki, I
                    think. Anyway, Taqua, Akiki that area, just to see what Chile was. I had never
                    set foot in Chile, neither had Fred. As in all these trips, we called on the
                    local newspaper editor, and the local newspaper editor of this southernmost city
                    of Peru happened to be a very strong Allende sympathizer and felt the Castro
                    Cuban with a more democratic face way was the way to go. Allende was the natural
                    pathfinder for the way development should also go in Peru. He was not a great
                    fan of the military government but he was clearly a radical socialist. So, we
                    called on him just to exchange views and find out how things were going in
                    southern Peru. He was terribly concerned. He said there seems to be a military
                    coup against Allende. He was listening to his radio and would frequently be
                    interrupted by somebody bringing in some sort of bulletin. After all, he had
                    Telex, that sort of thing. We told him our Ariex was all hell, this was going
                    to, Oh, and he also told us they closed the border and no one was going to get
                    across the border. We said oh hell there goes our weekend. We were going to
                    spend it down in northern Chile. We were also quite interested in what was
                    happening of course. We were uncertain, so we went up to Puma. By the time we
                    got back to Lima it was pretty certain that at least provisionally decided
                    although it was uncertain how things were going to develop. But we did that on
                    our trip. We saw local political leaders, local former political leaders be they
                    Apristers, almost anything. We did not call on local members of the communist
                    party on our trips. It was just felt that would not be prudent and there were
                    other ways of knowing what they think. We did call on people if they had a
                    position like this newspaper editor who I would call a radical socialist at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>Q: Do you get any felling before you left about the Peruvian government looking
                    differently toward the United States after the Chilean overthrow of Allende? Did
                    they think of us with more hostility or maybe more caution because of the
                    feeling we could reach out and do things. Did you notice any of that?</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I don't think they really believed, I mean after all they had contacts
                    with the Chilean military too. I don't believe they believed we had a
                    predominant role or even all that important a role to play in the events in
                    Chile. I think they were aware the impetus for what happened in Chile was
                    domestic. The United States at most approved what happened, and there were
                    elements in the United States who deplored what happened, but the U.S.
                    government was certainly not all that happy about what happened but we were not
                    a prime instigator of it or even a major instigator of it. It was domestic. I
                    later served in Chile and learned a lot more about what happened in Chile at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>Q: Before we leave Peru, later I recall the indigenous population of Peru became
                    quite important. Did we have much contact or feel for how the Indian population
                    was being treated or dealt with?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: The Indian population aside from the fact that they had damn well
                    better not get involved in any ethnic activity, politically related ethnic
                    activity, was probably treated better by the military government than they had
                    been by the prior government. The military government encouraged cooperatives
                    for example, provided they took their guidance from the military and supported
                    the military. They encouraged them strongly. They supported them financially;
                    they tried to get them going supporting the doctrines of the military revolution
                    as they liked to call it in Peru. You have got to remember the Sendero Luminosa
                    despite all the acclaim, was not an Indian movement. They were led by the same
                    predominantly well, mixed Indian white ethnic origin people most of whom did not
                    speak any either Cachura or Aimara, the two Indian languages and more from the
                    coast, Cachura being more important, Aimara being important only in the Puno
                    area. They tried by dint of real terrorist activity, wiping out Indian villages
                    to get Indian support or at least Indian acquiescence or non cooperation with
                    the government on the part of the Indians. The Sendero Luminosa had not yet
                    started while I was there, but this university at Aiucucco and one university
                    outside of Lima were really hotbeds of radical leftist ideology. I visited the
                    campuses of both universities. I visited, I can't think of the name of the town
                    now, where Sendero Luminosa first became prominent if you will. The university
                    professors there were highly radicalized, and the students there were highly
                    radicalized. You saw all sorts of radical leftist slogans. The ruling class must
                    be eliminated. Little quotations from Mao. Mao's little red book was sold in
                    Peru. There is no restriction against it. Quotations were here and there on
                    placards. All the outsides of the buildings were filled with graffiti everywhere
                    you could get a spray paint or a brush, radical leftist things. All this sort of
                    thing. Kill all of the oligarchy, the Yankees, imperialism must be stamped out,
                    Indians of Peru unite, all that sort of thing around there. The student
                    population were not Indian either primarily. Everybody, of curse, 80-90% of the
                    population of Peru has a large Indian racial element, genetic element. Most of
                    those people particularly on the coast as I say, don't speak the Indian
                    languages. There are cruyoyos there, culturally at least.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>Q: Let me get a feel. My experience with students is Korea. Every spring the
                    Koreans get out and they demonstrate they take the line that they have to unite
                    Korea. The police put them down, tear gas and all, and then as they graduate
                    they go out and become good, solid members of the establishment. It is almost
                    like an initiation rite. What was your impression particularly in Peru or maybe
                    elsewhere of this very radical university thing? I mean what did it do to the
                    people once they were out of the university?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Well, out of the university, most of them continued to be radicalized.
                    They were active members of communist party cells. Some in the military, not
                    that radicalized, but there was a radical element in the military. Many of those
                    lived in the suburban areas. After all having a university degree didn't mean
                    you had a ticket to anything in particular. Some of them with university degrees
                    lawyers and so on continued to be radicalized and continued to support the
                    communist party or even more radical elements in the community. Many who stayed
                    on in the university system as professors particularly in the social sciences or
                    economics tended to be at least as radical as they ever were. They continued,
                    after all, Sendero Luminosa was founded by university professors, and they
                    continued to be quite radical. The communist party became quite too tame. In
                    fact the communist party was concerned about this radical development. There was
                    the Maoist international communist philosophy and the Soviet international
                    communist philosophy. Most of these guys were on the Maoist side. Some became
                    businessmen and became much more conservative. I would say it was not nearly as
                    universal as it was in Korea although I am not an expert on Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you left in 1974. Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Well I was offered two jobs, one political counselor in Nicaragua.
                    Following my political counseling job, it turned out I never had a political
                    counseling job. I was as you recall the sole State Department political and
                    labor officer in Trinidad as political counselor which it wasn't really but it
                    had the equivalent thing. In Nicaragua, Sheldon Turner who was the very
                    controversial conservative Ambassador to Nicaragua, for some reason the
                    Department never told him that they that I was not taking the job. They offered
                    me DCM in Georgetown, Guyana, under a career Ambassador named Max Krebs who was
                    just in the process of being assigned there. I didn't give it three thoughts,
                    though Guyana was not the center of the world and was not considered the most
                    plush post by any means in the world. There was a big criminal problem and a
                    government that was often hostile to our interests, I immediately accepted. I
                    had my name put to Max as Ambassador and Max took me as Ambassador.Well, some
                    time after that, Dick Vargavie, the DCM in Lima called me and said, “Wade, I
                    thought you were going to Guyana as DCM.” “Well, I am, and I have been formally
                    assigned there.” “Well, what is this cable from Sheldon Turner saying he still
                    hasn't heard anything about the assignment of Matthews to take the place of the
                    officer who had established a name for himself in the foreign services for
                    opposing Sheldon Turner and his policies and later was Ambassador to Argentina
                    after other things.” “Anyway, where is Matthews?” And the department gave me a
                    call or I called the Department, I called personnel and I said, “What is
                    happening, I understand the assignment is official.” “Oh, yes, you are but we've
                    got to tell Sheldon Turner something and they said the Ambassador insisted on
                    having Matthews for this important DCM job.” “We have an ideal candidate for
                    Political Counselor for you. We just have to cross a few more strings. We'll let
                    you know shortly.” When I called they said, “We haven't the foggiest idea who to
                    send, but we'll find somebody.”</p>
                <p>Q: Sheldon Turner won renown because I don't know if it was at that time but
                    there was a very severe earthquake and the Ambassador's residence was undamaged
                    or relatively undamaged, and he and his wife forbade people from the Embassy
                    from even using the bathrooms. It is one of the Foreign Service stories that
                    gained a great deal of renown. It sounds like you probably knew and were well
                    out of it.</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: That was a big part of it. It was not just the political counseling.
                    Jim Cheek was the fellow I would have been replacing. His name wouldn't come to
                    me at the moment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you went to Guyana, and you were there at our
                        Embassin Georgetown from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I was there a little over two years from June of '74 to August, I
                    think, of '76 as DCM. I had an excellent assignment there. Max Krebs, the fellow
                    I served under, his previous assignment had been as DCM in Argentina. He had
                    served as DCM somewhere before. He knew Latin America very well and it turned
                    out that this was his first and only Ambassadorial post. He had a relaxed
                    attitude toward it. He realized that retirement was mandatory at that time at 60
                    years of age. His retirement came before I left and I served my last few months
                    there as Charg�. When I arrived, he had a lot of home leave accumulated and he
                    wanted someone he could turn the post over to with some confidence who would
                    take it for several months while he used all this accumulated home leave. I got
                    there in June and he had scheduled his home leave which he didn't come back from
                    until late September. He was leaving in late June, so I had, I was introduced to
                    everybody. I learned what I could about what should be done. I was told about
                    what sort of Fourth of July celebration we were supposed to have which I was
                    supposed to host as Charg�, and he went off for home leave. He would check into
                    the Department every now and then to make sure I hadn't run the post into the
                    ground. I had an excellent experience with him. He, having been a DCM, he knew
                    how to handle a DCM and how to let the DCM develop. He had no jealousy at all.
                    Oftentimes an ambassador would be jealous of the DCM. “That's my contacts; you
                    stay away from my contacts.” He had none of that. He had no problem with my, Now
                    when he was there on post, the prime minister was expected to call on him and
                    deal with him, not with me. Ditto with some of the ministers although some
                    ministers I maintained some contacts with. Anyway, I had a fine time.</p>

                        Americainterests there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: The American commercial interest was Reynolds Aluminum at the time.
                    They were under strong threat of confiscation and certainly of nationalization.
                    Our attitude and Reynolds' attitude was you want to nationalize, nationalize but
                    with adequate compensation. If you don't there will be repercussions. No
                    confiscation in other words. Nationalization is up to you. We didn't put any
                    real pressure on them not to nationalize. Bauxite was not that much in short
                    supply. Nationalization with compensation was quite OK. But there were problems.
                    Guyana was a country of slightly under a million people. It has dropped in
                    population now because of so much emigration since then, not because of a low
                    birth rate. It was about 50% or 55% East Indian in population, about 35% black,
                    and the remainder mixed races.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>Birnham's government was a black dominated government. I was told by a one time
                    confidante of Birnham, the issue of democracy for Guyana was brought up. It had
                    a democratic form; they did have elections. The issue of democracy was brought
                    up and where Guyana should be in the political spectrum. Birnham looked at it, a
                    very intelligent man, he looked at it pragmatically and said, “Look, in a real
                    democracy, this is allegedly. I cannot say this conversation took place. It is
                    logical and I think it probably did. “Look, I can go one of three routes. I can
                    be a real honest to God western liberal democrat. If I do that, the United
                    States will be pleased and approve, but I won't last long at all because voting
                    in Guyana is ethnically based. I'm black; the majority race is the East Indians.
                    Their traditional leader, not their leader but their leader since politics had
                    developed was a man that I and the American CIA and the British helped me
                    maneuver out of power, Cheddi Jagan who was a Moscow line communist and will
                    always be a Moscow line communist. That's gonna take place and once that takes
                    place there won't be democracy anyway, and even if there were, he could stay in
                    power. He will just have the support of the East Asians against it. The other
                    route I could go would be to try to maneuver Cheddi Jagan off as the communist
                    leader, but the Russians will never really trust me. Therefore I will be under
                    their thumb in any event and the United States won't like me either. The other
                    way is to be a radical socialist authoritarian. That way I can maneuver
                    elections, I can stuff the ballot box, I can make sure that I stay in power. The
                    United States won't like me, but the Russians because the United States will
                    dislike me so strongly, they will not even push their man to take over. They
                    will keep him alive as in case I go in a direction they don't like, and I will
                    have credentials in the third world. I will be a respected independent third
                    world leader.”</p>
                <p>That is exactly what happened. Guyana had importance out of proportion to its
                    size in the third world movement. There were Prime Ministers came and went a
                    number of times a year. Guyana played a strong role at the United Nations as a
                    leader of the third world even though there were less than a million people,
                    slightly less than a million people, and had a limited GNP. So Birnham was
                    nobody's fool in that respect; he stayed in power that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we deal with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: We had old ties with Birnham when he was a labor leader. He was a
                    barrister, he was never a legitimate labor leader, but labor unions at the time
                    he got involved in Guyanese politics were the way to the top. He developed some
                    trade union credentials, but he broke them once he got in power. The
                    non-communist element of the trade union movement was in the government's pocket
                    or else some elements of it were independent. We had no labor attach� there. I
                    handled what labor matters as an old labor attach�, what labor matters we did.
                    Our relations with Birnham as I would like to have it was as if you give the
                    fact that he is going to oppose us internationally, Guyana is going to vote
                    against us almost overwhelmingly at the United Nations, they aregoing to try to
                    establish radical third world credentials.They are going to vote generally the
                    way the Soviet Union wants to, but they will not develop close ties with the
                    Soviet Union. For awhile they were toying with the idea of developing close ties
                    with Fidel Castro and the Cubans. The largest Embassy while we were there was
                    the Chinese Embassy. The Chinese thought here is a radical third world regime
                    that can easily become, while Maoism was beginning to, the cultural revolution
                    was still in power, Maoism was a little shaky at that time, but here was a way
                    into Latin America. The Chinese didn't realize that Guyana wasn't Latin America.
                    It was in South America but it wasn't Latin America. This was not a stepping
                    stone to Latin America. They had a huge embassy there, larger than ours by far,
                    larger than the British, larger than the Russians. The Cubans established a
                    sizable embassy there. I remember ours and the Cubans and the Russians were
                    about equal in size. Next came the British; next came some others.</p>
                <p>When I got there, I consulted, well it was an interesting political situation, I
                    thought there were some ties. Birnham, I had very good personal relations with
                    Birnham but very little influence on tactics that he did. I was taken by the
                    ambassador and introduced to the Prime Minister, the President, everybody. When
                    I was there, Birnham would sit on the porch of his house and smoke Cuban cigars.
                    He didn't drink Cuban rum because in the Caribbean the drink of choice is Chivas
                    Regal. They would occasionally drink Johnnie Walker Black Label; I'm talking
                    about the elite.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chivas Regal is a very expensive scotch, and Johnnie
                        Walker Blacis close to it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Not Johnnie Walker Red. Only at American receptions where the waiter
                    serves you and doesn't show you, would you deign to drink Johnnie Walker Red. So
                    he wouldn't find out. So we would sit around and smoke these Cuban cigars and
                    talk Guyana and how things were going. I could joke with him better than the
                    Ambassador I think because in Trinidad I learned to speak old talk which is sort
                    of Creole. It is English it isn't real Creole. Of course Forbes Birnham could
                    speak better English than I having trained in the UK as a barrister and all
                    that. He enjoyed talking old talk and whenever he would start talking old talk
                    with me, I knew that I could have considerable leeway. He wasn't really that
                    annoyed with me, but he wanted to tweak me a little, so I would reply to him in
                    old talk. Illustration: The Fourth of July reception. We had decided because we
                    were getting increasingly annoyed with Birnham and his pronouncements against
                    the United States and his pro Castro pronouncements and their votes and sayings
                    at the United Nations, we would show him that maybe we had another horse to play
                    there. As a faint little show for the first time ever, we would invite Cheddi
                    Jagan, the leader of the opposition and longtime member of the communist party
                    with his American wife. We'd invite both of them to our national day reception.
                    The ambassador authorized this and so on, so we did. Cheddi called up
                    incidentally, and talked to my secretary and said, “Look do you mind if Janet
                    goes early and I come a little later because I have to fill in for my brother in
                    his dentistry practice,” Cheddi was a dentist, “at the noon hour and I have
                    appointments scheduled at noon, and I can't get there until one o'clock without
                    canceling some appointments which I would prefer not to do.” My secretary
                    consulted me because I was charg� at the time and I said, “Of course, sure, tell
                    him to come on at one.” Well, he came. I had a vice consul there to tell me who
                    was coming, and Birnham was there, the president was there, everybody was there
                    at the reception at the ambassador's residence, not in my residence, where it
                    was planned to be. The guest list was approved by the ambassador. I don't want
                    to say this was all my doings. Jagan came in an I went over. I had met him
                    before. The ambassador said, “If we are going to invite him, we ought to call on
                    him.” Janet was there and everybody was there, and I went and started talking
                    with Jagan. My old talk is a little rusty now but it went something like this.
                    Birnham came over and said “What dis I see. You consult with the opposition.” I
                    said, “Sure, I consort with your opposition. Dats what we do on de post. We talk
                    with everybody.” Jagan said, “What you complain about? You and the American, you
                    plot agin me. You kick me out as premier of de country. I be prime minister if
                    it weren't for dese American, and now you complain because I talk wit dese
                    American.” Jagan going into old talk as well. I turned to Cheddi and said 'Om'
                    God Cheddi. Yes, you know I say dat, but here you get me in trouble. I just
                    arrive in the country. I probably be PNG. I don't want to be PNG yet.”</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>Birnham then says some other conversation. He drifts off and I drift off and we
                    have other conversations. Somebody snapped a picture of Jagan and Birnham and
                    myself, and there was a newspaper called Caribbean Contact published in Jamaica,
                    a weekly circulated all around the Caribbean. The picture was in there and it
                    said, “It takes the Americans to do it.” There was an article under the caption
                    and it said U.S. ambassador, well it said Cheddi Jagan, Forbes Birnham, prime
                    minister of Guyana, and Wade Matthews, U.S. ambassador. I sent this to Max Krebs
                    and said Max tell them who you are. The whole essence of the article was, and
                    there was a radio analysis of this, the Americans getting Jagan and Birnham
                    together who are bitter political enemies talking serious stuff.</p>
                <p>Well, that was the serious stuff. Anyway that was illustrative of the sort of
                    environment we were working in. I found it a good environment, an interesting
                    environment, even though U.S. policies were not being, really, we were defending
                    them as well as we could, but we couldn't defend them any better.</p>
                <p>We had an AID program there. We looked at the thing while we were there and
                    recommended that the AID program probably be downgraded and eliminated
                    eventually. The AID director didn't approve of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were there I guess it was Reagan. Ford had
                        happened.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: This was '74 right after Watergate I guess. It was thFord
                    administration most of the time I was there.</p>
                <p>Q: Kissinger was the Secretary of State. Were we comfortable of having this type
                    of government that was sort of dumping on us in the international field but was
                    also keeping from becoming a hotbed of communism. Do you think as far as where
                    the Department of State was coming from that we ought to do something, or had we
                    learned to live with this.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Guyana was a backwater in every respect, except their role in
                    international organizations and third world organizations. They were an
                    annoyance to us there. Otherwise they were pretty much a backwater. We wanted to
                    keep a certain interest there particularly once the Reynolds thing was resolved.
                    It was important to the U.S. not so much for the amount of money involved, but
                    if Guyana were to literally confiscate, this would be the second after Cuba. It
                    would inevitably cause a strong U.S. reaction and could push Guyana into a much
                    more formal alliance or into the Cuban-Russian orbit despite Jagan and Birnham's
                    differences. Reynolds Aluminum hired Arthur Goldberg a former Supreme Court
                    Justice and former Secretary of Labor to go down and represent them. He was a
                    lawyer of course and consultant. He made at least two trips down. He negotiated
                    an arrangement. It was very tough negotiating. Reynolds' lawyers there,
                    Goldberg. We kept involved; we were not sitting in on the negotiations, but
                    Goldberg would brief us on what was going on, and some people in the government
                    would tell us what was going on. I remember, I guess I was charg� again at one
                    time, and I got instructions to deliver another Reynolds proposal. They were
                    wrapping it up at this time, but there still were some issues to resolve.</p>
                <p>I called Birnham up at his office. He got into his office at 8:00 in the morning,
                    and I called him up and asked to speak with him directly. The secretary put me
                    through to him. I told him I had this cable that just came in and I was supposed
                    to present it to him. I said, “I realize your cabinet meeting starts in half an
                    hour.” He said, “Come on over, they can wait.” So, I came over, and I walked
                    down the line. I guess it was about 8:20 when I got there. The cabinet ministers
                    were all assembled sitting in chairs in the anteroom. I walked among them saying
                    hi and so on. I gave this to Birnham and he looked it over. He made some
                    comments and I made some observations. He said, “What do you think about this?”
                    I told him, “I don't think it is going to wash. I think this is really sort of a
                    final position.” Whether it was or not I don't know but that was what I
                    indicated. So, we talked for about half an hour, and I came out to all sorts of
                    glares form his cabinet ministers for making them wait outside, but it was
                    Birnham. I said, “Don't you think I ought to get out of here and let you talk to
                    them.” “No let them wait. This is the most important thing we have to decide
                    today anyway, and I want to get this fixed.” Birnham also would, the man slept
                    about two hours a night. He should go to bed about 1:00 and get up about 3:00
                    and then he'd get the wireless newspaper articles and that sort of thing. He had
                    the habit of calling people at three o'clock in the morning. On several
                    occasions he'd call me at three, I guess because he felt comfortable with me,
                    having first met me in a bedroom in Trinidad. He'd call me to say, “What the
                    hell is going on Mister Charg�,” or whatever, depending on his mood, how he
                    started. I'm sorry, he did not call me Wade. It was Matthews. “Matthews, what
                    the hell is going on here?” I said, “My god PM. What time is it?” “It is three
                    o'clock in the morning and you call me about something some American said,” and
                    so on. I could interact with him that way. He would joke about PNGing me
                    occasionally and I would toward the end.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yes it was settled on terms satisfactory to Reynolds. In fact this was
                    as I recall the one that was accepted was the one I carried over to him. There
                    may have been a few more little details.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: A buyout at a price that was lower than Reynolds wanted to get but at a
                    price they finally decided they could accept. That was what we wanted. We did
                    not want this to be a confiscation. We wanted a negotiated buyout which they
                    had. Well there were problems in Guyana. Once an element in the ruling party put
                    out a contract on yours truly. Supposedly we heard this through...</p>

                <p>MATTHEWS: I was to be eliminated with prejudice. The reason I was to be
                    eliminated with prejudice was supposedly because the way we got it and as I say
                    this was through certain sources. The reason I was to be eliminated with
                    prejudice was because I had too good contacts with a sort of pro democratic
                    trade union element which was opposing the government. This was a thuggish group
                    of people who had actually eliminated an opposition figure already. They were in
                    the governing political party but not and this was actually brought up
                    supposedly at a meeting of their Foreign Minister with Henry Kissinger. The
                    foreign minister said, “Oh this was an element and obviously as soon as we heard
                    this element. We immediately clamped down on them.” After the foreign Minister
                    got back from a meeting with Kissinger he called me and asked me if I'd come
                    over. Fred Will was his name. I had good relations with him, good within the
                    context. I said, “Are you sure you don't want to see the ambassador?” “No, this
                    is something I need to see you about.” I said, “Okay, I will tell him that I am
                    coming over if you have no problem with it.” I said, “I don't know what it is
                    for sure but I have a hunch it is such and such.” He said, “Yes, I think
                    probably you should go over, but if he gets into a discussion of anything else,
                    let me know because I am here now.” So I went over to see him and he said,
                    “Wade, one of the things the Secretary brought up, one of the early things was
                    this item. I had no idea you people knew about it.” I said,”Well, Fred,” it was
                    a Fred sort of relation then, and he did call me Wade not Matthews like Birnham
                    did. “Fred, we know a lot of things. Well you know immediately the PM and I
                    heard about it we said don't ever raise this sort of thing again, but you know
                    nobody told me that.” “If you ever hear of anything why don't you come to me,”
                    he said. This was sort of joking I said, “You know Fred, I thought you might be
                    in on it.” He said, “What!” “I am sort of joking, but I just didn't feel it was
                    appropriate to come to you with this sort of thing.” Of course I couldn't
                    because of the source. It is now long enough after so I can say this in this
                    interview.</p>
                <p>Q: What about Jonestown while you were there and could you explain what Jonestown
                    was? This certainly raised the attention of everybody in the world a couple of
                    years later.</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Jim Jones was sort of a radical religious leader who ended up in San
                    Francisco, California. He was from Indiana originally or something. He had a
                    self centered sort of church of a few hundred members. I think as it developed
                    it was about three quarters black and one quarter white and he took in the
                    dispossessed and the people who had mental problems and stability problems and
                    drug problems and that sort of thing. It turned out his religion was centered
                    around Jim Jones as the savior, almost the second coming. He had met the Deputy
                    Prime Minister, a man who was not that influential in government named Talemy
                    Reed. Talemy Reed felt this was... He was interested in establishing a
                    cooperative where his group Mormon like could emigrate from the repressive
                    United States and form a cooperative commune sort of thing, agricultural
                    commune. Talemy Reed was interested in developing communal agricultural
                    enterprises cooperatives and so on, so this was right down his alley. He said,
                    “Yes, come on. We'll arrange to get you some land up at the Mathews Ridge area,”
                    which was an isolated area of Northwest Guyana that they were interested in
                    developing partly because Venezuela claimed that territory as well and they
                    wanted to reinforce that claim.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>So he went and he developed this colony there. He had an office in Guyana staffed
                    by two women, one of whom it turned out he had sexual relations with, this sort
                    of thing. When we were there, Jonestown was not nearly as large as it later
                    became. They had the colony; they had cleared some land. Jim Jones was not
                    living in Guyana; he had visited twice. The first time he visited he called on
                    our ambassador and I sat in on the conversation. He said what he planned to do
                    and so on, and we wished him well and thanked him for coming by and that was all
                    our involvement with it. The local people there in Georgetown were invited to
                    the little American women's coffees. They were several times in my house and the
                    Ambassador's house. My wife and the ambassador's wife invited them over because
                    they had a coffee occasionally for the whole American women's group. It was
                    fairly small. I went up one time to visit Jonestown. The ambassador did as well.
                    It wasn't called Jonestown at that time. It was called the People's Temple
                    settlement at Mathews Ridge.</p>
                <p>I went up largely because I have never been there. The Guyanese had adopted a
                    requirement that diplomats, to go to the interior, had to get foreign ministry
                    permission and they weren't giving permission to go to places like that. I found
                    that I could walk over to the Guyana Airlines place and buy a ticket and go, and
                    so my wife and kids and I decided we'd take a vacation there. The main reason we
                    wanted to go was we had all sorts of reports about Cuban military presence.
                    Guyana was a way station for the supply of Cuban troops and munitions to Angola
                    at the time. The planes were stopping at Guyana, refueling and keeping on going.
                    That was a standard route they took to Angola. They did have some Cuban military
                    people there who were training the Guyanesenational service and we could not
                    find out how many from any source. The CIA gave us all sorts of differing
                    reports; there were a couple of hundred or two or three or what have you. We
                    simply couldn't find out, so as a part of my purpose was to look into that while
                    I was up there because in Guyana you can do a lot overtly. So, I went contrary
                    to the guidelines from the Foreign Ministry which we didn't like anyway, bought
                    the ticket, went up there.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>We stayed in the Guyanese government guest house up there - lack of coordination,
                    you see. They offered us a Guyanese government driver, as they did for most
                    people who were staying up in the Guyanese government guest house. They said,
                    “Where would you like to go?” I said, “Let's go to a national service camp.”
                    That is where the Cubans were supposedly training, these X number of Cubans, and
                    there were about three or four Cubans there it turned out. They were fairly open
                    about it. I think two of them were teaching Spanish and one of them was teaching
                    karate and another was teaching I forget what, something to do with counter
                    insurgency but it was real small scale stuff. Anyway we went up and we went by
                    People's Temple. We drove into the People's Temple compound in this Guyanese
                    government land rover, he said, “You know only two weeks ago they opened it up
                    so a four wheel drive land rover could get in. Prior to that, you had to have a
                    People's Temple tractor meet you and haul you in on a trailer. But, we can go
                    in,” so we went in unannounced. I was most certainly, our Ambassador had already
                    been there, the first U.S. diplomat to go in unannounced. There were a couple of
                    British geologists or something that came along with us, they were also staying
                    at the government guest house. We went in and pulled up to the People's Temple
                    building. They were sort of bamboo buildings with thatched roofs that sort of
                    thing. The nicest quarters were by the chimpanzee that they had brought down
                    from San Francisco, an abused chimpanzee, Mr. Muggs who had quarters at least
                    the size of this room.</p>
                <p>Later on somebody unfortunately gave poisoned Kool Aid to Mr. Muggs in the
                    so-called Guyana massacre. Anyway, we drove up and I got out. I announced myself
                    to somebody who came out of the thing. He said, “The Reverend Jones is here.” I
                    didn't know Jim Jones was there at the time. He was just down on a visit. “Fine,
                    I met him in Georgetown.” He went back in the room and I stood out. The other
                    people were still in the land rover because I wanted permission for us to get
                    out. Then a man with a movie camera he didn't come over toward me. He went and
                    stationed himself about 20 feet away. Jim Jones came out in a safari suit with a
                    man with a tape recorder behind. He went over and, “I'm the reverend Jim Jones.”
                    I guess I was Charg� at the moment. “Yes, I'm Wade Matthews, the Deputy chief of
                    Mission at Georgetown, and we met at the ambassador's office a year ago.” “Oh,
                    yes,” he said. “What do you think of the Guyanese government's agricultural
                    policy?” I said, “Well, because it was cooperatives against private land
                    ownership, that sort of thing, very interesting, Reverend Jones. What do you
                    think of the Guyanese government policy?” “Well, what do you think of,” and then
                    another sort of potentially incriminating question with the man with the tape
                    recorder and the movie camera going. I fenced around the same way for a moment
                    and then he relaxed. The movie camera went down. We had our Dr. Livingston, I
                    presume, handshake. We went over and sat down. They showed us around the place
                    and showed us what they were trying to do. My analysis at the time was this is
                    the kind of place just as soon as they got it going well, the Guyanese
                    government would come in and take it over and expel them from the country, and
                    settle it with Guyanese settlers.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>At the time it was about two thirds white and one third black, Americans all. A
                    total of maybe 65 people. At the time of the massacre there were 800 and some,
                    about three quarters black. When we left, the only complaint I had... No, I'm
                    sorry, we got one complaint about somebody being sort of kidnaped there. We
                    talked with the representative there in Georgetown, and the person came down as
                    I recall and told us “Oh, no, it is my parents. They don't understand.” He
                    wanted to be there. Certainly when I visited, the people appeared to want to be
                    there. There was an old black brick layer 90 some years old from Highpoint,
                    North Carolina who wanted to die there, before the massacre. Anyway, the only
                    complaint I had was from the Roman Catholic Archbishop who came by some time
                    earlier. This was Jones' first visit there, I think, to complain that he had
                    allowed them to use the Sacred Heart Catholic church, which was the most popular
                    Catholic church, for an ecumenical service that turned into a faith healing
                    service. He was absolutely scandalized by it. My reaction was, “What are you
                    coming to me for? Did you ask our advice before you did that?” He said, “No.” I
                    said, “Had you asked our advice we'd have had to tell you that what you do is
                    your business. We really don't know much about the people. They called on us
                    once and we really know almost nothing about them.” He was mollified. He
                    actually bought my car when I left.</p>

                <p>MATTHEWS: In Guyana, no I think not, but let me just mention one thing since we
                    were talking about Jonestown and leading up to that, let me follow on a little
                    more. I left, I was Charg� Oh I forget the last couple of months I was there,
                    and I hosted the big Independence Day Fourth of July celebration. We had all the
                    Guyanese government officials there. Our relations up until the time I left were
                    quite cordial on a personal basis. On a policy basis, they opposed us almost
                    everywhere we turned. It was certainly successful and I had relations with
                    everybody. I would joke with the Jagans about the CIA, for example. Janet once
                    told me “I know who the CIA people are in your embassy.” I said, “Well who are
                    they.” She said, “Well I couldn't tell you that. Don't you think I probably know
                    if they are there?” Anyway it was that sort of relationship. I was a member of
                    the Rotary in Guyana. Max Krebs was a member of the Lions; we had good relations
                    with basically everybody. It was a little stiff with some of the more radical
                    elements of the PM. Unfortunately from a policy standpoint, the personal ties
                    weren't always followed through when the individuals who run the country are
                    adamantly had their own reasons. I told you Birnham's basic theoretical reason I
                    think. Some of them had racial reasons, this that and the other, they had been
                    discriminated against when they went to school in the United States. The big
                    thing was trying to get out of Guyana on a visa to the United States. There were
                    visa fraud problems. I didn't mention that. As DCM I was not only political. We
                    had an economic officer who was pretty good representing us in economic and
                    commercial and reporting how things are going which was downhill in Guyana. U.S.
                    commercial interests became very small after Reynolds left. In Consular, I would
                    say half our officers were consular officers there, and we had a terrific visa
                    fraud problem. One officer after he had left post, we found he had been selling
                    visas. He was allowed finally to resign to our disgust without being prosecuted
                    because he agreed finally to resign in lieu of being prosecuted. We had him dead
                    to rights; he had been selling visas. He left shortly after I arrived, so he
                    wasn't selling many visas after I got there. It was partly a man who came in
                    complaining to me that he hadn't been sold for the gold, he hadn't been paid for
                    the gold this officer had bought before he left post. It turned out we were
                    talking quite a few thousands of dollars of gold with the officer earning, I
                    don't know what he was earning at the time $14-15000, certainly could not have
                    paid, but it was more than that in the amount of gold he had bought. Anyway it
                    unraveled, and a very alert vice Consul was sort of on to it about the same
                    time, and we found out and the security officers came and all that. Anyway
                    consular was a significant problem. Security was a problem, a bad security
                    situation. The guard house was about two blocks away from the embassy, and the
                    marine guard on his way to the Embassy was mugged twice by just walking that
                    block and a half. We finally arranged, we did not have guard transportation, but
                    we arranged to have the aide guard and the marine guard and the consulate guard
                    to all come out on the street at the same time so that they could keep the
                    marine security guard under observation at all times. They would blow their
                    whistle and he would start up and they would blow their whistles and they would
                    start running toward him two of them anyway with their billy clubs had anybody
                    attacked. We got around it that way.</p>

                <p>MATTHEWS: 1976. I started on something, one thing before we leave to finish
                    Guyana. I left and turned the post over to John Blacking as charg�. There had
                    been an ambassador, a political appointee who had been sent to the Senate, I
                    think his name had been sent to the Senate. Something had come up, I think it
                    was an income tax problem, and so it was not pursued and his name was withdrawn.
                    Before they could identify another ambassador there was a plane, a Cuban plane
                    on the Angola run that was blown up by Cuban exiles in the fall of '76, right
                    after it took off from Barbados. Birnham came out and roundly condemned the CIA
                    as behind this reflecting Fidel Castro. Henry Kissinger, now this is partly
                    hearsay, but it is true. Henry Kissinger was so annoyed, the hearsay part is I
                    cannot vouch for the conversations. I had left Guyana by that time. He went to
                    somebody in his office and said, “We will not tolerate this; pull our ambassador
                    out.” “Mr. Kissinger, we don't have an Ambassador there.” “Well, who do we have
                    there?” “We have a charg�, an FSO-3, John Blacking.” “Well, pull the charg�
                    out.” They did so. The next person was Dick, I don't remember his name. Anyway
                    he was an FSO-5. Dick McCoy, had been Guyana Desk officer, who was still an 05.
                    He was in charge of the consular section which was FSO-4 grade position. Dick
                    McCoy was suddenly charg�. I mean it was a more senior other agency officer's
                    position. He had to be charg�. So, Dick McCoy remained as charg�. John Blacking
                    sort of twiddled his thumbs back in the Department working on Guyanese and other
                    matters until the Carter administration had been installed and at that time, the
                    felt that Kissinger was no longer there and they sent John Blacking back. He
                    remained charg� until the following summer at which time John Blake got assigned
                    as ambassador. He was ambassador during the...</p>

                    at the OAS called Deputy Director of the U.S. mission to the OAS, the
                    Organization of American States in Washington.</p>

                <p>MATTHEWS: I was there only because I was offered a job that was more interesting
                    to me. I was there only form the Fall, September of '76 until the beginning of
                    May, '77 when I went over to be the director of the Office of Central American
                    Affairs. Now Deputy Director of the OAS was not the number two job at the OAS.
                    It was the number three job. There was the Ambassador to the OAS, there was the
                    Deputy Chief of Mission it was called at the time to the OAS, and Deputy
                    Director was number three.</p>
                <p>Q: We'll pick it up the next time and talk about the OAS and then move on to
                    other things.***</p>
                <p>Today is the second of October 1997, and I've got Wade Matthews up from Florida
                    again. Wade, we are going to the OAS, '76-'77. Could you explain the role of the
                    OAS at this particular time as perceived by a Foreign Service officer assigned
                    to it and also who was the Ambassador.</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: The Organization of American States was certainly not the centerpiece
                    of U.S. foreign policy. In fact, some people would sat it is irrelevant. It
                    wasn't irrelevant but once again it was not the centerpiece certainly. The
                    Ambassador to the OAS when I arrived was Bill Bayard, a former Congressman. This
                    was toward the end of the Ford Administration. The deputy there was Bob White
                    who I think went on to be Ambassador to Uruguay. Then, as I say, I was number
                    three. We had a political officer, Mark Beon, very capable fellow who reported
                    directly to me although obviously took many of his instructions from my boss and
                    his boss. We had an economic officer who represented the economic elements of
                    the OAS, and an administrative officer and then the administrative staff, a sort
                    of office manager, not an office manager but administrative chief. Then we had a
                    long time civil servant. I forget precisely what he represented us on but he had
                    certain specialized organs of the OAS, and then one other officer, so it was an
                    office in the ARA bureau which was basically the way we operated. Now what did
                    we dWell, there are a number of organizations from the permanent council to the
                    specialized organs. I would normally not be the principal representative there,
                    but at times for example when we were between ambassadors Bayard left not too
                    terribly long after I arrived. Maybe this was the time that the administrations
                    changed. I think it was '77 when the Carter Administration came in. I think at
                    that time Dale McGee came in, a former Senator from Wyoming.</p>
                <p>Q: While you were there it has become a centerpiece of the first year of the
                    Carter Administration, the Panama Canal which obviously had OAS repercussions.
                    Was the Panama Canal at all an issue at this particular time?</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yes it was. I would say my principal nemesis in the OAS at those times
                    when I was the representative at various committee meetings and one or two
                    meetings of the permanent council where I represented us was Nelson Piki, the
                    acerbic, at times eloquent, always loquacious representative of Panama. He had
                    political credentials in Panama as radical anti U.S. I don't think he was a
                    radical leftist in that sense although he was rather leftist in the sort of
                    nationalistic Latin American vein. He was constantly as we would say now, on our
                    case. He would constantly anything he could use to attack the United States in
                    the debates and dealings that we had, he did, and of course, he was pushing the
                    Panamanian position on the canal. “We need the canal back. You guys have been
                    there long enough.”</p>
                <p>Q: I take it at this time, the tail end of the Ford Administration, there wasn't
                    much stirring within the Ford Administration on the Panama Canal.</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: No. Not too long after I got there, the elections took place, of
                    course, and everybody was waiting until basically after that for the Carter
                    Administration to take over. We know later what happened during the Carter
                    Administration. Most of that the negotiations were underway, the political
                    maneuvering was underway, but most of what took place regarding the Panama Canal
                    and negotiating the agreement took place after I had moved over to Central
                    American Affairs.</p>

                        side,Nicaragua and Somoza because he was out by the time you got there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Oh, no. He was very much in power. During the time I was at the OAS he
                    had considerable military success against the Sandinistas who had started their
                    insurgency mostly in northern Nicaragua. He had great military success, in fact
                    they were fairly quiescent in the OAS. Nicaragua was not a big issue in the OAS
                    or in the American body politic at that time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I'm trying to place this by time. I don't remember that being an issue
                    while I was there. I believe the Malvinas/Falklands issue really brewed up,
                    certainly the war and the Argentine invasion sometime after I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was '81 or something. Well, were there any issues
                        during thtime you were there of particular concern?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I'm trying to put my thoughts back to that particular period of time.
                    Major issues that still stick with me, none in particular. The Latin American
                    countries were still on more of a nationalistic bent then than they are at the
                    present time. Panama was probably the leader of the let's get more control over
                    our economy and political life element at that time than any other nation that
                    comes to mind. Argentina was in that camp as I recall. Brazil was sort of a
                    moderate force at that particular time. Chile of course had the military regime.
                    Just thinking back I'm afraid I'm a little hazy on many of those things.
                    Economics, assistance, the obligation of the developed world particularly the
                    United States to increase its assistance to Latin America, the idea that Latin
                    America should have a greater say in exactly how the assistance should be
                    distributed and the conditions on it. Those were issues that came up time and
                    again. The Cuba issue came up several times in several different ways while I
                    was there. Cuba, of course was not a participating member in the OAS at that
                    time. There were occasional alarms that Cuba would like to get back in; there
                    were moves toward inviting Cuba back in, that it would come in. That was one of
                    the favorite topics of Nelson Piti and the Panamanians. They wanted Cuba to
                    participate because they thought Cuba would lend weight to their position on the
                    Panama Canal. Let's see. There were one or two of the smaller Caribbean nations
                    who came in while I was there. I think it was Grenada or one of the others. That
                    was an issue to the extent should the small Caribbean nations come in with full
                    voting rights which they did eventually come in as or should there be some sort
                    of special requirements for them somewhat more limited than the others. I think
                    Grenada was admitted. There was considerable disdain for Eric Gary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes he was seeing flying saucers, things of this nature,
                        nejewel movement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yes. I remember when Eric Gary, I think I was the acting representative
                    of the U.S. on the permanent council when Eric Gary came in largely because I
                    think my two bosses were away. There was a conference somewhere and maybe the
                    other was on vacation or something. I remember sitting in the U.S. chair at the
                    time. I had met Gary years before in the Caribbean when I had been assigned to
                    Trinidad. He at the time was a labor leader and I was a labor-political officer.
                    I had a passing acquaintance with him, not at al a good acquaintance because he
                    was not within my area of responsibility. He was such a pariah when he came to
                    the OAS. I believe I had lunch with him because nobody who was up there in the
                    mission. And of course there was a more formal luncheon, after that he was sort
                    of ignored. My recollection is after that we had lunch together.. There was
                    nobody better to have lunch with at the time.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there at this time in the OAS a feeling that the Caribbean was something,
                    I mean these are so little pip-squeaks and the 21 original nations of Latin
                    America, were they considered to be one thing and the Caribbean countries to be
                    lesser nature? Was that there do you think?</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: It was there to a limited extent; however, it was applied more to the
                    little nations like Grenada. These are second class citizens in effect was the
                    feeling on the part of many of the Latin American nations. It wasn't applied
                    against countries like Jamaica for example, but the smaller ones they were
                    certainly regarded as second class citizens, and they normally only had only one
                    representative to the OAS. Most of those nations' principal representative also
                    wore the other had as Ambassador to the United States. I would say at the time,
                    about half of the nations had a separate Ambassador to the United States, I mean
                    to the OAS, and the other half had it as another hat that their Ambassador to
                    Washington wore. Almost all of them except for the very small Caribbean nations
                    had an officer whose principal responsibility in the Embassy was OAS matters in
                    their Embassy to Washington. They did not all have a separate mission or
                    separate ambassador to the OAS.</p>
                <p>Q: Did the OAS, was there a Cuban connection to the OAS. Sometimes you can have
                    a, it might not be represented. We've done this in plenty of cases where you
                    have somebody that keeps track. Was there sort of a floating Cuban
                    representative for the OAS?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Cuba, I don't believe they even had an interest section Washington at
                    the time. I don't think they did, and of course, Cuba carried out their
                    international activities regarding the hemisphere and the United Nations
                    certainly exclusively to the OAS. They carried on no real activities in the OAS,
                    In fact there was in this debate as to whether Cuba should be allowed back into
                    the OAS that some of the Latin American nations were pushing, never a majority,
                    but some were definitely pushing it. Well, perhaps later a majority but not
                    right at that time. The question that was asked frequently sometimes by us was
                    even assuming that they were allowed back in, would Cuba even come back in
                    because they would be clearly pretty well outnumbered by those that were there.
                    In any event Cuba and some of the other Latin American nations pushed their
                    prime, their prime focus was the United Nations, not the OAS.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were relations with the ARA, the Latin American
                        bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: OAS was treated more or less like another country directory.
                    Organizationally, they were a little apart, but a representative of the OAS
                    attended the staff meetings for example, the weekly staff meetings. That's where
                    we took our policy guidance from the ARA bureau. Occasionally, the ambassador
                    would do an end run if he particularly didn't like it around. He did have access
                    above the ARA bureau, but the ARA bureau was what we operated under which was
                    logical. I personally had no problem with it. The ambassador to the OAS, and
                    frequently both Paul Bayard and Dale McGee, would attend occasionally the ARA
                    staff meeting. They didn't normally attend the ARA staff meeting. This is the
                    weekly meeting of office directors. Bob White would be the normal attendee at
                    that meeting, in other words my immediate boss. I would often, in fact I would
                    usually attend sitting in the second row back from the table. When Bob was tied
                    up doing something OAS or out of the country I would attend the staff meeting
                    and represent USOAS.</p>

                <p>MATTHEWS: Well let me elaborate a little on that. When I first got to OAS, the
                    Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs was Harry Schlauer. When the
                    administration changed, Terry Todman came in as Assistant Secretary for the
                    inter American affairs, and I mentioned earlier that Dale McGee came in as
                    Ambassador to OAS about the same time, I don't remember. Policy papers were
                    prepared under Schlauer's regime if you will in the inter-American bureau on
                    various subjects. The major policy paper from ARA was our policy toward Latin
                    America, what the elements of it should, be and giving alternatives and options
                    of course for the incoming Carter team. This paper came by us, by USOAS for
                    clearance and input and we did our input as to the OAS and what we should do in
                    it and the relative importance of it and so on. Anybody who wanted to had an
                    opportunity to make an input into the overall inter-American policy. Now the
                    draft, I think this was a later draft; I think this already had Carter
                    administration team input. In any event it took a look at Central America. Now I
                    was not an expert on Central America. I had been to Central America, but I had
                    never served there; I never had any responsibility for Central America. It
                    essentially said, and here I am oversimplifying, Central America is a throwaway
                    region. Here I am excluding Panama. Panama was not considered part of the
                    Central America region. The rest of it is an area in which we have almost no
                    interest, very little interest from the traditional U.S. interest standpoint;
                    therefore, Central America with its human rights problems particularly in
                    Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, and to a somewhat lesser extent Honduras,
                    would be a good place as a testing ground for the success, presumed success or
                    failure of the Carter human rights policy. Carter in the campaign and the team
                    were strongly committed to making this an almost central element of U.S. foreign
                    policy. The idea was you couldn't make it the central basis of our foreign
                    policy with countries like Brazil or Argentina or Mexico or really Panama or a
                    number of the other countries, Venezuela because of the oil and so on. In
                    Central America you could and therefore ignore the other elements of U.S.
                    national interests such as defense, such as the cold war related to defense, the
                    economy of the United States, economic advantage all that sort of thing and put
                    human rights as number one.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>I disagreed with that. I felt that human rights should have an important role to
                    play in Central America for the very reasons they mentioned. You could give it
                    more emphasis in Central America than elsewhere, but the basic elements of U.S.
                    foreign policy should be the same for any country. The defense and preservation
                    of the institutions of the United States, the so-called traditional political
                    elements and the economic elements should have primacy, with the human rights
                    being a strong secondary maybe even put them equal to the economic interests and
                    so on. This paper which I did not exactly as a rebuttal but I hoped a
                    contribution that wasn't really reflected in the final paper, was seen by the
                    team coming in to inter-American affairs and Terry Todman apparently saw it and
                    it concurred with his views, so Terry asked me either directly or through John
                    Bushnell, I forget which. I think directly. “Would I be interested in taking
                    over as director of the Office of Central American affairs?” Marvin Weissman who
                    was an AID officer was my predecessor. He ran the last of the joint AID-State
                    country directories. That had been an experiment some years before and was
                    breaking up and had really broken up for all the others but as long as Marv
                    remained there it remained a joint office but they had decided to split them
                    into an AID Central American Affairs and a State Central American Affairs, and
                    so they wanted a State officer to take Marv's place. Marv incidentally went as
                    ambassador to Costa Rica.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there in the Central American job from '77 to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I was there from the middle of May '77 to I think it was December '78
                    or January of '79, less than two years and we can get into the circumstances of
                    it later.</p>
                <p>Q: Well particularly considering the heat generated when Reagan and his group
                    took over in Latin America and if you weren't with them you were agin' them. I
                    would have thought that having a paper out saying human rights are important but
                    would have annoyed the team coming in because they usually are all full of fire
                    and vinegar when they first arrive and then the reality gets in. Usually it is
                    not appreciated when somebody points out there are other things in the world. It
                    is surprising you got tapped for that job.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yes, you've got to remember I had nothing to do with Central American
                    policy prior to that time. The reason I got tapped was almost entirely Terry
                    Todman, the new Assistant Secretary. The White House, I was a cipher to them.
                    Bob Pastor and people like that had no idea at that time who Wade Matthews was.
                    I had no particular record one way or the other on human rights and national
                    interest that they could readily identify. So it was basically a cipher and
                    Terry Todman as the new incoming Assistant Secretary for inter-American Affairs
                    had a fairly free hand to pick his country directors, his office directors, so I
                    don't think that had anything to do with that. Now later when the Reagan
                    administration took over, during my tenure as director of Office of Central
                    American Affairs I became fairly well-known as a dissident to the Carter
                    administration's Central American policy. I tried to promote it where I could,
                    but I frequently said I don't think this is a good idea. I don't think it will
                    play well over the long haul; I think it will have negative implications. The
                    reaction generally, particularly after Todman left was, “Yes, but that is the
                    policy. You are not making policy, fella [fellow], you are to implement policy.”
                    I would go ahead and implement it to the best of my ability then, with
                    considerable reservations. So when the Reagan administration took over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is after you left this job. They came in '81 and you
                        left i'79.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yes, long after. In any event by that time I was down in South America
                    on another job. It was not the sort of - memories are short - it was not the
                    sort of thing... This guy was right all along or we agreed with his reasoning in
                    retrospect; therefore, we'll pick him out and give him a plum for that. It was
                    beyond that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you arrived in '77, what was Central American
                        Affairs,what was on your plate as far as priorities as you saw it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Well what the administration wanted to be on my plate was push human
                    rights, and here I am putting it in more blunt phrases than would be in any
                    paper, get rid of Somoza. Get a democratic regime installed in Nicaragua. In
                    Salvador at least do away with the rather gross human rights violations. Honest
                    elections in Guatemala. Democracy and human rights and peace and light and all
                    those good things. Make all of Central America like Costa Rica. Costa Rica was
                    the model. That is what they wanted. This is a very naive way of looking at
                    it.</p>
                <p>Q: Just as an attitude, you are an American sitting up in Washington, and we felt
                    Central America was a place we could do something in a way internally. We are
                    not talking about external things. We are talking about internal things, but we
                    still felt it was our responsibility.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yes, Central America was looked on a little differently from, not
                    entirely differently but somewhat differently, from the other countries of Latin
                    America. We had long involvement in Central America. Most Central American
                    countries are very small and they hadn't developed their own institutions to the
                    extent that South American countries and Mexico had done so. Since we had been
                    involved in Central America, our marines ruled Nicaragua for some length of
                    time. We had intervened after W.W.II for political reasons in Guatemala. We all
                    know we had been involved for many years in Costa Rica, somewhat less so in
                    Honduras and El Salvador but that was still part of the region. Unlike the other
                    part of Latin America where you had small countries namely thCaribbean, the
                    English speaking Caribbean had been a British preserve for a long time.</p>
                <p>The only parallels you could draw between Central America and the rest of Latin
                    America in the way they were regarded by the United States were Haiti and the
                    Dominican Republic, and Haiti of course was a little out in left field as a
                    hopeless case anyway. French, not really Latin America to the same way it was,
                    so the Dominican Republic is about the only other place you could make
                    comparisons to Central America in the way they were regarded by the traditional
                    establishment up in Washington. Once again, I was to an extent a dissident over
                    some of those things at that time even though I was in charge of Central
                    American affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place, I take it the Panama Canal business
                        wapretty much taken care of in a separate office.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: There was a separate country directory because of our extensive
                    interests in Panama of Panamanian affairs. I got involved in that only to the
                    extent that any other office director of inter-American affairs would. That was
                    Bob Pastor's who was Zig Brzezinski's Latin American man over at the National
                    Security Council, that was Bob's passion. That was what Bob Pastor spent I would
                    say during the early, during the time that I was there as country director,
                    spent half his time looking at and dealing with Panamanian affairs.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, let's talk about Nicaragua. I take it from what you have said Somoza
                    seemed to be really well in power when you arrived on the desk in '77.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yes. Militarily he had pretty well defeated the Sandinistas, not
                    completely defeated, but there was not a serious insurgency threat in Nicaragua.
                    There had been a lot of human rights violations involved in that defeat.
                    Sometimes after all, when you have guerrilla warfare and civil war you tend to
                    have more violations than you do really in even invasion type war because
                    political passions are involved. It was not considered a serious military threat
                    at that time. Now the new administration cautious though he were I would put
                    Warren Christopher as one of the leaders of that element. Certainly the human
                    rights bureau of the Department of State was a leader in the idea of looking at
                    in order to solve the human rights problems and the problems of democracy in
                    Nicaragua, first you have got to get rid of Somoza. Then you essentially try to
                    arrange democratic transition itself. My position from the beginning was you
                    have got the order wrong. You try to arrange a democratic transition from the
                    traditional Somoza rule which was with many democratic elements. There were
                    elections in Nicaragua.</p>
                <p>Somoza told me one time, I met with him on just two occasions. On one of those
                    occasions he insisted and I have heard this from other sources and I think it is
                    probably correct, that yes the last election, I forget when that was. We are
                    talking maybe '76 before I took over the job maybe earlier, he said yes the
                    ballots were not accurate, if they had been the opposition would have gotten
                    considerably less votes than they did. To make it look better to the outside
                    world, we in effect, now I'm exaggerating what he said, we cooked the ballots.
                    We falsified some vote returns so as to give the opposition more votes than they
                    got in a number of districts. I think he was probably correct. The Nicaraguan
                    voters, largely rural, to a large extent uneducated, many illiterate. The voters
                    voted basically traditionally just as their parents had done for Somoza because
                    Somoza was recommended.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the Carter administration concern with Somoza. You said as part of
                    your unwritten brief was to get rid of Somoza. What was the problem with Somoza
                    from their perspective?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Not only unwritten it was implicit in some of the policy papers that we
                    got. It didn't say get rid of Somoza but with the human rights and the
                    advancement of democracy should be the basis for our policy in Nicaragua. These
                    were the instructions in various memoranda that had been approved and we got.
                    This is impossible as long as Somoza was in power; therefore, any implementation
                    of our policy would involve his departure from power. Why? The regime was
                    corrupt, there is no question of that. It had been corrupt from the beginning,
                    traditional corruption in Nicaragua. I'm not sure there had ever been a
                    completely honest regime there because as in many other countries, government
                    was a place to get power so that you could dispense favors, and if you dispense
                    favors you got something back for it. You got political support and you got
                    financial support. In order to retain power if you are at the top, you've got to
                    spread this around.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>The stories in Nicaragua in the National Guard, there was no army technically, it
                    was a national guard which was a sort of militarized police force. You had to
                    buy the right it could be things like the chief of police of Managua for example
                    which was a very lucrative position. It cost, I don't remember figures but let's
                    throw out a figure, it cost maybe $100,000 that you had to pay to get that
                    particular position. In order to make it pay you had to get in because the
                    salary was who knows what $10,000 something of that nature, you had to sell
                    subsidiary positions, so you sold maybe $300,000 worth of subsidiary positions
                    in the police and those people in order to pay back what they had to pay to get
                    their subsidiary positions, so you have got a thoroughly corrupt system. That
                    undoubtedly was true, the figures we can forget but everybody had to pay to get
                    government positions or government favors or people to sign documents and so on.
                    Somoza was fully aware of that, but that was the way he and his father and
                    family had stayed in power for so many years. Probably to have the opposition
                    come in his position was and quite possibly correct, they would have simply
                    taken over this system and continued it. Anyway that was part of the issue.</p>
                <p>My position was that you work out with the powers that exist in Nicaragua an
                    orderly transition to a more democratic system. As part of this you try to
                    suppress this built in system of corruption. I was not very sanguine you were
                    able to suppress it, but I thought you could bring in a more democratic
                    situation. In any event, you could if you played your cards right convince
                    Somoza that it was in his interest and our interests for such an orderly
                    transition. In such an orderly transition his ill gotten gains would be
                    essentially protected. Not that he could continue to accumulate them but what he
                    had he could essentially keep, but he was going to have to give up control of
                    Nicaragua. His party could play an element in any succeeding regime but it could
                    no longer control the country as it had for the previous several decades.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>I went down to Nicaragua for my first trim, to Nicaragua and every other Central
                    American country except Belize. Every time I scheduled a trip to Belize I had
                    some problem so I never actually got to Belize. I did talk with Joy Price who
                    was the premier of Belize at the time, but up in Washington. Anyway I got to
                    Nicaragua in May or June of '77. Somoza had a heart attack at that time. Let me
                    see, I'm mixing two trips up. Anyway one of the trips to Nicaragua, I guess this
                    was later. The first time I was there I sort of gave general versions of this
                    line, of my policy and of the United States policy that clearly a transition had
                    to be arranged; it had to take place and so on. I believe it was the second trip
                    I made to Nicaragua which was somewhat later, Somoza was recuperating from his
                    heart attack. This was probably early '78, maybe later in '77. I went around and
                    met with the foreign minister and people in the foreign ministry and a variety
                    of people. I was there several days and was staying up at the ambassador's
                    residence. Mauricio Solaun was our ambassador to Nicaragua, a political
                    appointee, a university professor from Indiana. Somoza wasn't really receiving
                    anybody because he was still recuperating and he was spending his time down on
                    the Pacific coast where he had a house and a ranch and that sort of thing.
                    Solaun had to go off on Friday the week I was there to a conference of
                    ambassadors I think it was for the region. Shortly after he left a message came
                    in that Somoza would like to see me if I could come down. Well, I touched base
                    with the ambassador because after all it was his country. I tentatively accepted
                    but said I had to work out some scheduled. I delayed my departure for Costa
                    Rica.</p>
                <p>Bottom line, I went down, the ambassador said fine, of course, go ahead. He might
                    have gone with me but I think Somoza may have delayed it because he wanted to
                    talk with me privately though he never specifically said so. At any rate it
                    worked out that way. The ambassador was out of the country. He said, He did not
                    want the DCM to come down; he wanted to meet with me.” I knew it was private
                    because he said he wanted to meet with me, just myself. The ambassador okayed it
                    and I went. Interesting meeting.</p>
                <p>I'm leading up to what my private message to Somoza was which was not in
                    contradiction to U.S. policy. I may have emphasized some things a little more
                    than if I had a formal brief to give him. I got out of the car, and he was
                    sitting on the porch sort of overlooking the Pacific, a nice view. He came over
                    to the car and I immediately started to address him in Spanish but we switched
                    to English because he had a good knowledge of English at times profane English
                    that he had picked up at West Point. Anyway I introduced myself and he said,
                    “Come on over and let's sit on the porch.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He recorded the conversations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Right. This was my first meeting with Somoza in '77 or possibly early
                    '78. It was at where he was recuperating from his heart attack. I knew it was a
                    meeting just between the two of us. Yes he had a reputation for recording all
                    conversations with American officials, this sort of conversation, not cocktail
                    party conversations. I looked to see where the microphone inevitably was. He was
                    sitting over at the side, and there was a lamp hanging right over me. I'm
                    reasonably confident there was a microphone up there, so this conversation might
                    be on tape somewhere recorded n the archives in Nicaragua. That I don't know,
                    but I certainly wasn't recording it.</p>
                <p>We sat down and said a word or two of pleasantry, I think he offered some coffee
                    or something. He began I suppose partly to un-nerve me a little or maybe he just
                    said what came into his mind. His first words were something of this nature and
                    I don't think I'm exaggerating the phraseology, “What the hell does that son of
                    a bitch Jimmy Carter think he is doing now?” How does an American diplomat
                    answer that? Well, you have got to realize the basis of our foreign policy and
                    one of the major elements of it in Nicaragua is the promotion of human rights as
                    it is in Latin America as a whole I slightly exaggerated saying. Anyway we got
                    into U.S. foreign policy; what do they want with Nicaragua. His position was,
                    “Here I have been a loyal ally of the United States for many years. Were it not
                    for me, Nicaragua would be a communist country. You Americans are far too naive
                    and particularly the new administration is extremely naive. They don't know who
                    their friends are. I have got a lot of friends in the United States,” and a
                    little hint of threat, what is his name, Murphy.</p>
                <p>On the other hand I believe he had heard that I was not an enthusiastic supporter
                    of the exclusive attention to human rights. After all, he had his sources in
                    Washington. We sort of began discussing this. I said, “Nobody wants to have
                    another model particularly another country, but there are elements of what is
                    happening in Costa Rica and the Costa Rican system and what that place has
                    evolved to which might be applicable to Nicaragua.” We got into that. He said,
                    “Oh no, Nicaragua is much more like Honduras, the ethnic makeup of the people.
                    They are mostly Indians; they don't know how to vote. The Costa Ricans are
                    white,” a bit of a racist tinge to it too. “Nicaragua is a different sort of
                    people,” he said. “Look at Honduras and Nicaragua. Nicaragua has a higher
                    literacy rate than Honduras. Nicaragua has a better per capita GNP and so on.
                    Nicaragua is much better than Honduras in all these ways and also a more
                    reliable ally of the United States. It is because of myself and my family and
                    the stablegovernment that we have in Nicaragua.”</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>The conversation was a good one. I emphasized the fact that one thing he had to
                    remember regardless of the benefits even if he were correct in everything he
                    said, he and his family had been in power for decades in Nicaragua, almost as
                    long as the United States in our recent history has been involved since our
                    latest intervention when his father basically came to power though he didn't
                    actually take over the Presidency at that time. Therefore that is an impediment
                    in the U.S. body politic and the way Latin Americans looked at Nicaragua which
                    was really just impossible to overcome. This is my conversation with Somoza.
                    Rather than focus on what you have done for Nicaragua and for U.S.-Nicaraguan
                    relations which admittedly the alliance and support has been mutually very
                    beneficial. I tried to put it in as good a light as possible. “No we have got to
                    look at the future, and how can what you do and what we do best protect the
                    interests of the U.S. and of Nicaragua and your own personal interests. This is
                    just impossible for this to endure. It is an anachronism in many cases in Latin
                    America. So, what you should look at is an orderly transition which protects
                    your interests and protects our interests. It would involve, of course, you no
                    longer being president of Nicaragua after what ever time this took place.”</p>
                <p>Because he started out so friendly saying what the hell does that son-of a-bitch
                    Jimmy Carter think he is doing now. I felt I could be a little frank being a
                    relatively new director of Central American affairs. We did have a frank
                    conversation. He admitted this was something he should look at. He felt it
                    wouldn't necessarily involve his departure but anything could be considered.
                    Anything could be talked about.</p>
                <p>I made reports on my conversation and my trip when I got back to Washington. My
                    bottom line was if we play this man right, we might be able to do it. He might
                    give up his position as President. He might give up the actual power of running
                    the country but he has got to have his interests protected. There is no reason
                    the United States should seek retribution for the endemic corruption that has
                    been going on in Nicaragua for many years. That we should play with Somoza to
                    make the transition and if we played our cards right holding a stick in the
                    background of course in case he reneged on his commitments and so on, this could
                    work out to a transition to a more democratic society with fewer human rights
                    violations and furthermore one that would prevent, this was cold war time, the
                    communist element which was probably the predominant element among the
                    Sandinistas at the time and certainly the pro Cuban element, the Sandinistas
                    were universally pro Cuban, from gaining power. The Sandinistas would have to
                    have a role to play. Certainly the more moderate elements would have a
                    democratic role to play in Nicaragua, but it shouldn't be a predominant role. It
                    was highly dubious that they would win as a group. It was a grouping after all
                    and likely to split apart once Somoza the principal element was no longer there,
                    the principal opposition. This would be very conducive to U.S. interests. I told
                    Somoza also that despite his comparison of Nicaragua to Honduras just in my
                    relatively brief stay there I saw a lot of comparisons in the way the people
                    acted, their freewheeling attitude, their less subservient attitude than you saw
                    in Honduras. I really saw despite the ethnic makeup, more comparisons to Costa
                    Rica than I did to Honduras.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned promoting this with a stick in the
                        background.What was the stick?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Essentially that the United States could return, well the stick to an
                    extent would be AID. AID to the Somoza government after the earthquake, there
                    was a lot of AID after the earthquake, but of course, it was dropping
                    considerably, that if you had a democratic transition, the foreign assistance
                    probably would flow more rapidly. That was the carrot. The stick was what the
                    United States had already embarked on doing. Embargo of military supplies to
                    Nicaragua. Lack of discouraging Venezuela and Panama and certain elements in
                    Costa Rica from supporting the Sandinistas. That had been a change that was
                    already well underway that the authorities in Panama and we didn't think at the
                    time some authorities in Costa Rica who were doing it for the money were
                    funneling arms and supplying arms to the Sandinistas, but they certainly had
                    already started. By the time I talked to Somoza you could see that the
                    Sandinistas were getting rejuvenated. Previously a beaten sort of lackluster
                    attitude which was changed. They were gaining renewed morale at least. That was
                    the stick.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came back to Washington how was this
                        received?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Depended by whom. I think Todman liked it. Christopher as usual was
                    almost inscrutable, but he was probably more influenced by Patt Derian and Mark
                    Schneider and the human rights group then by us. He was already, I think
                    somewhat distrustful of Todman and his let's-work-out-a-mutually-agreeable,
                    basically the same position I had on Nicaragua he applied to Latin America as a
                    whole. The other position was the traditional, what the young group that came in
                    from the universities, also to parts of the administration which was “you can't
                    work with these bastards. They are hopelessly corrupt and undemocratic. You have
                    got to get rid of them and get new people,” much more to the left economically
                    and politically but people who could essentially be weaned to be democratic.
                    This of course the idea that you could work something out with Somoza to the
                    Human Rights Bureau was like dealing now with Radovan Karadzic.</p>

                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yes, in terms of human rights violations, but anyway I'm taking an
                    example from the present and applying it to the past. They didn't see any chance
                    of success. Somoza would hoodwink us again and stay on in power. There was no
                    way we could really apply this policy. Bob Pastor was very concerned with Panama
                    and didn't look at it that closely. Zbig Brzezinski had a lot of other items on
                    his plate, so the basic policy continued despite any recommendation I made and
                    despite really what Todman might have supported. Try to strangle Somoza and one
                    way you try to strangle Somoza was by indirectly at least encouraging the
                    Sandinistas. Indirectly by not having any objection to what the Venezuelans and
                    Panamanians were doing and many of the things coming in were Cuban origin
                    arms.</p>
                <p>Q: Considering what happened later, here we had a policy that was kind of funded
                    by those who want to do something. I mean the Sandinistas were guerrillas. We
                    had already gone through this particular scenario in Cuba and left us with a
                    very long lasting problem. How were we dealing with this because if we had this
                    policy of almost non-interference, strangling Somoza, and not trying to do
                    anything to the Sandinistas, we must have been talking with the Sandinistas,
                    predicting what would this mean, and all. Or were we doing that?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yes, one of the things that I pointed out time and again in various
                    papers that dealt with the problem. Like I said from the beginning, you don't
                    want to strangle Somoza, bring the Sandinistas in and then say we are going to
                    work out democracy with you guys, because it is not going to work. The
                    opposition, the Human Rights bureau which was the major focus of the opposition,
                    the policy planning staff was Richard Feinstein who was there at the time as
                    sort of the Latin American man on Tony Lake's staff. Their position was, look
                    these guys, we can work with them. There are democratic elements in them and
                    there were, no question, democratic elements among the Sandinistas. There was
                    also a strong sort of carbon copy of Fidel Castro among them, that sort of
                    communist element. Also there was a more contemplative communist element.
                    Basically they didn't trust real democracy either because they felt that real
                    democracy would be bought by the oligarchs and they wanted a thorough going
                    revolutionary society.</p>
                <p>Among the Sandinistas there was also a considerable element of opportunists. Many
                    of them just wanted power, and once they got power, they would use power as they
                    jolly well pleased. I didn't like that. I didn't think that was the policy we
                    should be following. I felt it ignored all the other elements of U.S. policy. I
                    did see a strong likelihood that you could have a less secure second Cuba in
                    Nicaragua. Less secure because Nicaragua had borders with other countries. I saw
                    unending problems if we continued with this policy, but I was unsuccessful in
                    getting U.S. policy changed, and so was Terry Todman.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you sense a gathering of the left, and I'm not talking about the communist
                    left, but the left and the liberal elements including Hollywood and newspaper
                    columnists and all those who were one, dumping on Somoza and two, building up
                    the Sandinistas? Was this an apparent movement in the United States?</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Not to the extent it had been in Cuba when Castro was up in the
                    mountains. I think the newspaper people remembered Herbert Matthews (no
                    relation, incidentally).</p>

                <p>MATTHEWS: I think he was. When you speak of the news media you are speaking of a
                    very diverse group. Jerry O'Leary who was a Washington Star, I think it was back
                    at the time, Latin American correspondent, I thought had very balanced views.
                    There were several other newspaper reporters and columnists who I thought had
                    balanced views. Don't forget the Nicaraguans, Murphy, Charlie Wilson over on the
                    hill, some other people essentially shared my views and sometimes I would talk
                    with some of them too. Not Murphy so much.</p>

                    for many years and a close confidante and supporter of his. He would call Somoza
                    on the phone and they would talk privately. He was one of Somoza's best channels
                    I would say. Murphy was beginning to have some other problems at the time. I
                    think there was some ethics or financial problems, something of that nature.
                    Charlie Wilson was a little different, Charlie Wilson from East Texas, young.
                    Incidentally Charlie Wilson had probably the nicest looking female staff over
                    there. It was always a joy to go over to his office which I had to with some
                    frequency because he would ask questions about Nicaragua and want a report on
                    this, that and the other. Not only Nicaragua but other parts of Central America.
                    He was not fixated on Nicaragua to the extent that Murphy was.</p>
                <p>Another Congressman I dealt with frequently was Ed Koch. He was from the other
                    side. later mayor of New York. Now I think he is a television or radio columnist
                    or something up there. He was one of the other people who was strongly
                    interested in what happened there, and he was very anti Somoza and I think
                    opportunistically subscribed to the human rights bureau's position on this. I
                    would say opportunistically because his most vocal supporters on this issue felt
                    that way. “Got to get rid of Somoza then we will let things evolve otherwise,”
                    and he reflected that view. He was very sharp a very talented individual as was
                    Wilson as a matter of fact. Where was I? I got off track.</p>
                <p>Q: We were talking about in the United States the elements that were both
                    supporting Somoza and the Sandinista movement because this tapped in to some of
                    these elements which became very important as time goes on.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I remember from my days as a student of Latin American affairs at
                    Stanford, the university community at least most of it was viscerally anti
                    Somoza, those who were concerned with Latin American affairs. So were many
                    newspapers. Chamorro whom I met with when I was down there was the publisher of
                    La Prensa and later was assassinated, had been president of the inter-American
                    press association at one time. He was viscerally anti Somoza. You have got to
                    remember, people oversimplify things. Chamorro was not a disciple of peace and
                    light either. The Chamorro family and the Somoza family had been bitter
                    political opponents on personal grounds and also on the grounds of where they
                    were from going back to the early part of the century. No matter what Chamorro
                    did, Somoza would oppose and no matter what Somoza did, Chamorro would oppose.
                    It went back to their parents and before that. It had something to do with
                    politics but not much. Some of the opposition was just not understood by
                    Americans. Anyway, Chamorro had a lot of influence among the press of course as
                    you would expect, La Prensa the biggest press organ in Nicaragua. The mere fact
                    that Somoza allowed it to exist, to continue under Chamorro was itself an
                    attestation that he wanted to protect some of his credentials of freedom and
                    that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>Yes, the press in the U.S. was, I would say, certainly anti-Somoza but by no
                    means pro-Sandinista though some elements were. In Washington the Post I thought
                    took a pretty balanced view of things. The Star, now the Times, well, O'Leary
                    took a very balanced view. He was their principal Latin American columnist.
                    Editorially they were a little to the right of where I would have been and
                    certainly far to the right of the Carter administration. The letter writers were
                    overwhelmingly anti- Somoza. I and the other elements were certainly not pro
                    Somoza. We all agreed, except for Murphy and maybe Wilson, that Somoza had to
                    go; it was just the circumstances of his going and whether you worked it out
                    with him for an orderly transition. And if he didn't go, did you push him out
                    regardless of the consequences or not. I would have said on that second line,
                    though I never communicated this to him, no if it came, if he wanted a
                    confrontation, if he tricked us and he stayed on, you did not push him out
                    regardless of the consequences; you looked at the consequences first which were
                    probably going to be bad for the United States.</p>
                <p>Another element that I brought up although I probably shouldn't have brought it
                    up with 20-20 hindsight as infrequently as I did, was if this thing does fall
                    apart, pushing Somoza does fall apart, the Sandinistas come in with their pro
                    Cuban regime and they violate human rights as well, there is going to be blood
                    on the floor. People are going to look a who lost China sort of thing. Although
                    who lost Nicaragua is not as important as who lost China, it is going to be a
                    problem. I did bring that up.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you getting either through intelligence or indirect communication things,
                    was there any sort of communication with the Sandinistas or intelligence about
                    them?</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Direct U.S. government to Sandinista communication, official
                    communication, probably no. People at the Embassy down there, people in
                    Washington, the Sandinistas did visit Washington. They would talk with people;
                    none of them ever talked with me directly. Yes, they did, I take that back. The
                    priest, he came up a little later on, what is his name. He is a member of the
                    Sandinista council. Anyway he came up and talked with me in my office one time,
                    telling me that the Sandinistas were essentially democratic. He was a Roman
                    Catholic priest, that they were Christian, most of them. We have all elements,
                    but it is essentially a moderate element. When I brought up other questions I
                    had, he fluffed over them. The United States government was complicit with
                    Somoza. He completely ignored anything that happened in the Carter
                    administration and he badly exaggerated prior U.S. policy. My conclusion was
                    that if he is the public face of the Sandinistas, then they are a pretty
                    hopeless group. He was badly misinformed, highly prejudiced, viscerally
                    anti-U.S., and rather viscerally pro Castro despite Castro's position at that
                    time vis a vis the Roman Catholic Church. I wasn't impressed.</p>
                <p>We got a lot of other indirect contacts with the Sandinistas. An individual would
                    talk with one of the Sandinista leaders and then report and I or other people
                    would talk about U.S. policy. Basically with the Sandinistas, our message was if
                    you guys indicate that you could work something out with Somoza, not for a
                    Sandinista takeover but something protecting his interests that would be
                    salable. That would be a message that I would deliver to these various areas. At
                    some times I thought it might be receptive, but I think the Sandinistas, one
                    reason they didn't was because they realized they were on the winning track.
                    That if they weakened, then they could have the whole thing. The United States
                    government in my opinion prejudiced though it may be, in my opinion had the
                    United States government adopted the policy that I recommended, that the
                    Sandinistas would have felt that this was their only real option, and they would
                    have adopted it and they would have come in feeling that it is better to share
                    power than to lose the whole thing by insisting on having the whole thing. They
                    had a reasonable chance of subverting or buying off the more democratic elements
                    of the regime, they should have bought it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any readouts say from the CIA or the INR about
                        thOrtega brothers, what their role would be and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: They were major elements of the Sandinista directorate of course, I
                    think Tomas Borke was the intellectual behind the Sandinistas. He was the
                    thinker. He was the individual who was sort of the ideologist, if you will.
                    Borke I had a much more favorable opinion of. I never met him. I had a more
                    favorable opinion of him than I did of the Ortega brothers. The Ortega brothers
                    I felt were radical leftists, opportunistic converts, if you will. Communism was
                    something they latched on to for opportunistic reasons. They were interested in
                    power. They had the usual viscerally anti-U.S. attitudes, but they wanted power
                    because of the various perks and what they could do with it. Borke I thought was
                    an intellectual. I felt he wanted to do really what he felt was best for the
                    country. He was a much more orthodox communist I thought though not completely
                    orthodox. I'm not sure that any of these were completely orthodox communists, in
                    other words like Cheddi Jagan did for so many years in Guyana, salute every
                    twist and turn of the Soviet line. He really believed it; this was a religion,
                    but that he would follow, try to maintain some ideological purity of the
                    Sandinista revolution more so than the Ortega brothers. They were opportunistic.
                    I wouldn't have trusted them any farther than I could have thrown anything were
                    I Castro, were I the Russians, or were I us. I could see them evolving as
                    another Somoza, if you will, with leftist overtones.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this play out during the time? You left when in
                        '79?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Early '79, I think around January of '79. Let me lead up to why I left.
                    It was essentially over Nicaragua. Todman left, he was given a golden parachute
                    as Ambassador to Spain, partly because he and Christopher had problems. Anyway
                    he left and Pete Bakey took over. Now Pete Bakey had been Ambassador to
                    Venezuela. Pete Bakey is a very skilled Foreign Service officer, a more
                    disciplined Foreign Service officer that I would say I was and probably more so
                    than Terry Todman. Pete Bakey did not push his personal agenda. I did to an
                    extent push my personal agenda; so did a lot of other people. The human rights
                    people were pushing a personal agenda. Pete Bakey was brought in because he was
                    skilled, he knew the area, and he would follow U.S. policy. I suppose a good
                    Foreign Service officer should. He worked much better with Christopher than
                    Terry Todman had. He tried to moderate policy to a certain extent.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>Essentially he saw that I had been unsuccessful and Todman had been unsuccessful
                    in selling the administration on the line that we handle Nicaragua and to a
                    certain extent El Salvador and Guatemala the cooperative way rather than a
                    confrontational way. Work with the powers that were there to get them to modify
                    their conduct rather than replace them with other powers. Anyway, we had been
                    unsuccessful so he felt let's do it retaining elements of your policy, but let's
                    do it in a way that is salable to the political forces in the administration.
                    The decision was made to send down a, by this time the Sandinistas because the
                    U.S. had not discouraged Carlos Andres Peres and not discouraged the Panamanians
                    from funneling Cuban arms up to the Sandinistas and not discouraged Johnny
                    Echeverria, the minister of something or other in Costa Rica from taking
                    payments probably from the Venezuelans and probably the Cubans as well in
                    through Costa Rica. The president had not discouraged him. In any event the
                    Sandinistas had gotten fresh arms, fresh financial support. The U.S. arms
                    embargo was hurting the Nicaraguans significantly. They weren't really able to
                    get many arms from anywhere else. The Sandinistas were really making progress
                    militarily. They had revived their revolution, and they were in a better
                    position than they had ever been.</p>
                <p>Along the latter part of '78 I think around October or so, the Department decided
                    they along with the Dominican Republic and I think Venezuela with OAS approval
                    were going to send a triumvirate down to mediate and try to arrange this
                    democratic transition or some sort of transition. And Bill Bobler who at that
                    time was the head of INR and who later took over as ARA Assistant Secretary.
                    Bill Bobler was to head the team. I'm sorry he was to be the American
                    representative on the triumvirate. Dick Barnaby went down with him as his
                    deputy. I thought that was a fine choice; I had no problem with it. Jim Cheek
                    who had been political counselor back when we were talking about Brazil had
                    established credentials as an anti-Somoza was interested in going down. Jim came
                    by to talk with me. I explained to Jim what I felt the team should focus on,
                    namely the same policy I had been advocating for a length of time. Now the
                    pressure is really on. Now you are going to have to arrange this democratic
                    transition or some sort of transition. Otherwise you are going to lose the
                    country. Therefore, the stick had been applied. Now let's go over the same ideas
                    we were presenting earlier. You can keep a modicum of power. One little element
                    in a number, most of your ill gotten gains, certainly all those you have gotten
                    out of the country. If you have an orderly society, you are going to be able to
                    keep many of those you have in the country. We will support this, but it will
                    involve your giving up power. It probably will involve your leaving the country
                    for a period of time at least. We might be able to work in some guarantees
                    against prosecution, but you can't keep running like you have done. In my office
                    at least, he seemed to say, yes, that is a good idea. I think we can do that. I
                    think it is workable and so on. So, I supported with Pete, maybe Cheek would
                    have gone anyway, the idea of Cheek's being included in the team, and the team
                    went.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>When they got down there in October or something, they did exactly as I
                    recommended they not do. They refused to see Somoza at first. They dealt only
                    with the opposition. Somoza sat over and stewed while they tried to work out a
                    combined opposition tactic which they would then endorse and they would present
                    it to Somoza on a plate. This is it; take it or leave it, and if you leave it,
                    you are doomed. You are out of there. This is not the way you play, I felt and I
                    said this on a number of occasions to no effect, this is not the way you handle
                    a person who had been dictator, president of the country and his family had been
                    before him for this length of time. He calls himself an aggrieved and wronged
                    U.S. ally. He had gone out on a limb or he said, time and again supporting the
                    United States down the line and here is the way we are treating him. You don't
                    do it. You play to the vanity of an individual like that. You say this is best
                    for you and us. Not take it or leave it. You are a bastard, but you play to the
                    vanity. The opposition would have certainly gone along with this sort of thing,
                    the democratic opposition. The Sandinistas maybe so, maybe not. If they said
                    not, then you clamp down on Peres and Johnny Echeverria in Costa Rica and the
                    Panamanians and you sort of cut off their arms supply. They didn't play it that
                    way at all</p>
                <p>Only after they had laboriously tried to work out a common position among the
                    opposition did they then go to Somoza and lay it on a plate in a manner that he
                    almost to protect his machoism, his image and his self-image primarily, he
                    almost had to refuse. Sure he was corrupt, but he had a certain self image and a
                    certain pride that he was going to go down in flames if you pushed him to the
                    wall. That essentially is what happened and that is the time where I said, “I
                    give up. There is nothing more I can do on Latin America.”</p>
                <p>The policy failed. Somoza turned down the suggestion of the three countries which
                    had been put to him in this form. The policy was made that, okay, Somoza has got
                    to go, we will insure that he is pushed out. That is where I said I cannot
                    support any such policy. I have been lobbying against that and so on. It was
                    about the same time that I got the word that was relayed to me as the opinion of
                    Christopher which was endorsed by Pete Bakey, “Well you have been against the
                    policy for a long time. Wade, you have lost the battle. If you can't support it,
                    then of course, you should go. You probably should have gone some months
                    before.” I said, “Under the circumstances I clearly should have gone some months
                    before.”</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>So, they brought in Brewster Hemingway to be the country director, a fellow who
                    was going to follow the policy as a good Foreign Service officer should, as I
                    clearly was not willing to do. So whether I resigned or whether I was pushed
                    out, technically I think I was pushed out. I started looking around for other
                    good places to jump. There weren't any good places to jump because I had already
                    been accepted for the senior seminar the following fall at the end of my tour. I
                    badly wanted the Senior Seminar where I wanted to be able to think and look
                    around and maybe write something. So during this month of December I was calling
                    over to the Inspection Corps. “Hey can you guys use me for six months?” They
                    said, “No not for that length of time. We'd be glad to take you for a tour,”
                    whoever the inspector general was at the time. I went and got a TDY to the board
                    of examiners, and left at that time. It doesn't give me that much pleasure to
                    say I told you so, but I had told them so and we saw what happened to Nicaragua
                    and we saw what happened to the U.S. policy in Central America. We saw the
                    Sandinistas and the Contras and the tremendous loss of life and the political
                    problems it caused. I really sincerely think had the policy that I recommended
                    and that Terry Todman recommended had been followed, that would have been
                    averted.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's talk a bit now about some of the other countries. First of all, as you
                    looked at your countries, Honduras, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and El
                    Salvador and Belize, where did Nicaragua rate human rightswise compared
                    particularly to Guatemala and Honduras?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: The worst violations of individual human rights, that is torture and
                    arbitrary arrest and killing and that sort of thing, were almost certainly in El
                    Salvador. I would place Guatemala as number two in that individual sort of basic
                    human rights category. Nicaragua is number three. Honduras is number four. Of
                    course Costa Rica is the best or Belize. If we are talking about the degree of
                    democracy, they were all I would say approximately equal. In Nicaragua you had
                    this institutional stability in that the Somozas were just automatically
                    re-elected. I recall what Somoza said about how he really had to cook the
                    elections to make the opposition look reasonable. The opposition was incredibly
                    inept in Nicaragua. They had a tough row to hoe of course. They would fracture.
                    They would break up. Many elements of the opposition themselves were corrupt.
                    They didn't appeal to the peasants. They tended to be more conservative at least
                    from their official pronouncements than did Somoza's party. I guess I would have
                    to rank Nicaragua was certainly in line with the others.</p>
                <p>There was some corruption in elections throughout most of those countries. Costa
                    Rica was pretty honest and Belize was. The count was probably cooked more in
                    Guatemala I would say than in the other countries. Maybe Honduras was perhaps
                    the more democratic of those aside from Belize and Costa Rica. The next level
                    down would have been El Salvador and Nicaragua, and probably the least
                    democratic was Guatemala. Guatemala had elections. I was there for one election.
                    It was just at the count where problems took place. There was a certain degree
                    of pressure on. And of course, a military officer was consistently elected, not
                    a civilian. But, within that, that was the nomination process if you will,
                    proving that there were elections.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what were the issues you had to deal with in your
                        areother than Nicaragua?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: In El Salvador you had some serious human rights problems. I mentioned
                    it earlier; it was probably the worst kind of human rights. You had killings by
                    both sides. You had disguised killings by both sides. Pro government forces or
                    police forces would disguise themselves as guerrillas and go in and massacre
                    some people. Guerrillas would disguise themselves as government forces and they
                    would go in and massacre some people, set off bombs, this, that and the other.
                    It was extraordinarily difficult for anybody to find out who had done some of
                    the worst killings. There was torture really on the part of both sides.
                    Certainly there was more publicity and more frequent on the government side. We
                    had some real serious human rights violations of all sorts in El Salvador. El
                    Salvador's democracy was probably more fixed than the others. The elections were
                    probably fixed as much as in Guatemala. Then you had a growing insurgency in El
                    Salvador. Honduras was much more peaceful. There was considerable corruption,
                    but you had pretty democratic elections and you didn't have many human rights
                    violations. The police were kind of brutal at times, but they are in most
                    countries down there.</p>
                <p>In Guatemala you had an insurgency that was reasonably controlled, but you had
                    some really brutal methods that the military used in suppressing the insurgency
                    and in dealing with dissidents. You also had another problem that had nothing to
                    do with human rights while I was there that blew up, and that was the
                    Belize-Guatemala territorial dispute. The British re-enforces their garrisons in
                    Belize. The Belizeans were quite fearful of Guatemalan intervention. Refugees
                    were coming over flooding Belize from El Salvador primarily, not from Guatemala.
                    A lot of Salvadoran refugees went to Belize. There were internal problems. A lot
                    of them established their own areas or communities which were Spanish speaking
                    and different from the population of Belize, and Belize was concerned with
                    them.</p>
                <p>Belize was not independent at the time. It was a self governing colony of the UK,
                    a commonwealth, something like that. I mentioned that I never got to Belize, but
                    I did. George Price the Premier of Belize called on Cy Vance who was Secretary
                    of State at the time. I was the note taker at that meeting as often times a
                    country director is, of course, or sometimes the desk officer, but I elected
                    myself as note taker. It would either be me or the desk officer because I was
                    interested in talking with Price. It turned out that Vance was distracted by
                    some crisis and Price and I sat around and talked for a couple of hours waiting
                    for Vance to come back.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>I found Vance incidentally, barely knew. Price wanted U.S. support vis-a-vis
                    possible Guatemalan territorial claims. They had some territorial claims which
                    could go back to all of Belize or part of Belize. The United States supported
                    Belize on all these territorial claims which gave another little problem vis a
                    vis Guatemala. I found Price incidentally to be well informed, moderate. He was
                    an ideal premier for a country which was having a very large and increasing
                    Spanish speaking minority because he was fluent in Spanish and English, and his
                    views basically I had no problem with. The British were giving him protection.
                    They had a Harrier squadron stationed there and some other things which the
                    Guatemalans protested was a violation of everything from the Monroe Doctrine to
                    what have you. It was not a very time consuming issue. It was another reason the
                    human rights elements supported as a rational for an embargo of any military
                    supplies to Guatemala. Actually that embargo was relaxed for replacement
                    supplies. One of the problems and one of the nits that just annoyed Somoza and
                    that I lobbied against because I didn't want to annoy Somoza, I wanted Somoza
                    cooperating on Nicaragua, was the infamous issue of the sling swivels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what a sling swivel is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: As you know, rifles and submachine guns have a canvas sling which
                    troops use to place it over their shoulder as they are hiking along. Nicaragua
                    back in the Ford administration or even earlier before the embargo had purchased
                    some weapons from the United States, all duly authorized, before my time on the
                    desk. It seems that the swivels, the little thing that attaches the sling to the
                    weapon were coated wrong so they rusted, and they started breaking and that sort
                    of thing. The company said sure we'll replace them. It is our fault. They are a
                    25 cent item or maybe a dollar item with the military supplies, that sort of
                    thing. The munitions control bureau routinely approved this and signed off for
                    the ARA bureau. I don't even think I boosted it to Todman. Todman certainly
                    supported me on it. The human rights bureau objected. They said this was a
                    violation of the embargo. Our position was, “Look this is stupid. Here is
                    something that was sold clearly a defective part, a sling so they can use the
                    things with broken sling swivels. If they made wire in Nicaragua the could go
                    out and a soldier could cut a piece of wire and replace the damn things so you
                    could repair them locally if necessary. All it is, is an irritant to Somoza if
                    you turn down these sling swivels.”</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>The Human Rights Bureau was adamant. It went up to Christopher. Christopher was
                    inclined to approve. Patt Derian said she would resign and denounce the thing if
                    the embargo were relaxed for sling swivels. Christopher drew back. He didn't
                    want to have an issue over sling swivels, something this minor, and besides it
                    would be a political problem for him if Patt carried through with her threat.
                    The thing then was gotten a hold of by a couple of newspapers. Charlie Wilson
                    brought it up on the floor of the House. It was a cause celebre, and I thought a
                    stupid issue. If you want to have a confrontation over something like an embargo
                    you don't do it over something like sling swivels. All it was it irritated
                    Somoza. This came up as I recall during my conversation with Somoza as one of
                    the illustrations of the idiocy of the Carter administration. I can't recall
                    exactly what he was referring to with the “What is this son of a bitch Jimmy
                    Carter think he is doing now?” The indignity that had been heaped on him in his
                    estimation. El Salvador was a real problem. We had an embargo against things
                    there.</p>
                <p>We sent while I was there a new Ambassador, a very capable person who I thought
                    had all the right ideas, Frank Define. He had been my colleague. I briefed
                    Frank. There were serious security problems in El Salvador. I went down and was
                    well received but I have to say I couldn't come up with a good solution. I said
                    all the right things to. I had a brief. I carried out my brief. I didn't
                    elaborate on my brief. The brief was good; I had a part to do with drafting it.
                    I didn't have the same basic sorts of problems with our policy in El Salvador as
                    I did in Nicaragua. There our policy was to get the government to agree that it
                    was in the interests of the oligarchy of El Salvador which controlled it along
                    with the military who were not from the oligarchy. The military were from lower
                    level people, lower middle class basically in El Salvador. That was one of the
                    problems. They tended to have some rather brutal attitudes about how you deal
                    with dissidents and dissident groups in El Salvador. El Salvador didn't have the
                    ethnic problem that Guatemala did, whereby you have identified Indian
                    communities in Guatemala. Half the population or more are identifiably Indian.
                    By that I mean Indian with oftentimes a distinctive dress oftentimes a
                    distinctive language, not entirely but oftentimes, that stand out from the rest
                    of the population. In El Salvador everybody is sort of mixed, so you didn't have
                    that problem, but you did have the problem of the insurgency.</p>
                <p>Q: We were doing things with El Salvador but we had this fixation on Nicaragua in
                    a way. Was it because there was a person we could lean on like Somoza who was
                    the name, as opposed to El Salvador where you have got a bunch of brutal army
                    officers? Did you have a feeling this got personalized?</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yes. Also El Salvador had an excellent Ambassador to the United States,
                    Saul Cameron I think was his name. He was from one of the old traditional
                    oligarchy families. I think his son is President of El Salvador now. I haven't
                    followed it that closely. Anyway a member of the family is president of El
                    Salvador now, a civilian of course. He was a wealthy individual, but he operated
                    far more skillfully than Sevillas de Casa did, the Ambassador from Nicaragua. He
                    got the ambassadorship to the United States as a wedding present back in the
                    '30s. He was the dean of the diplomatic corps. He just was not a skilled
                    operator and he got off on long winded speeches. He wasn't focused on what
                    people wanted to focus on, plus his ties with the Somoza family. He married, I
                    believe his wife was a sister of Tatio Somoza of the Tatio line. The original
                    Tatio was Tatio's father and Tatino became Tatio after the death of his father.
                    The younger Tatino, was a rather badly regarded Nicaraguan army national guard
                    colonel or something. So, yes, we had problems in El Salvador. In Honduras our
                    problems were more traditional. It was a more traditional regime, didn't have
                    major human rights problems.</p>
                <p>We had an active AID program focused on agriculture. Corruption was a problem.
                    The major problems with Honduras was what caused before I got there, the
                    Salvador-Honduras war. The border was not carefully defined. There were
                    Salvadorans that were crossing the Honduran border, settling in Honduras. They
                    were being expelled from Honduras. This had caused an upsurge before I got there
                    called the Salvador-Honduras war. This was before I got on the desk. The
                    relations were still a little tense. Partly because of these relations, the
                    Hondurans were allowing supplies to go across to the Liberation Front which was
                    the principal guerrilla organization I think in El Salvador. We were not anxious
                    for the FLMN to succeed.</p>
                <p>Basically I had no problem with U.S. policy toward El Salvador. These were bad
                    guys. They were very brutal individuals related to communist groups. I had no
                    problem with U.S. policy toward El Salvador. Human rights certainly were a major
                    element of it. Probably they should have been along with the idea that the FLMN
                    were not going to be the saviors of anybody. They didn't have the same sort of
                    good press that the Sandinistas had.</p>
                <p>In Guatemala, our major focus was treat the Indians a little better. Don't commit
                    too many human rights violations, get rid of some of the corruption. Have more
                    democratic elections next time. Try to get the military to move out of politics
                    a little. Don't do anything to Belize. Arms embargoes which we almost always had
                    for all these countries except for Honduras and Cost Rica of course, certainly
                    impeded our influence with the military. I would have liked to have seen some
                    relaxation of it particularly with those countries that had an active and
                    growing insurgency like El Salvador.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>In Nicaragua I didn't really push for doing away with the arms embargo because I
                    knew it was a completely losing cause. There was no way we could do it until
                    Somoza bought our things. I did believe we shouldn't have these little pinpricks
                    like the sling swivels, but the arms embargo was also a useful stick we could
                    hold, that we could relax it if he did what we wanted him to, an orderly
                    transition. In Central America I would say about half my time was devoted to
                    Nicaragua and half my time was devoted to everybody else.</p>
                <p>Let me just mention briefly about the staffing of the office. As I said, when I
                    came on the staffing drastically changed because the AID people separated from
                    State. I had a Deputy Director who essentially handled what I wasn't handling.
                    Sometimes we'd have crises and he or I would be on the task force. Then I had a
                    desk officer for Guatemala and Belize, another desk officer for Nicaragua. We
                    badly needed a single desk officer for Nicaragua. We had another for El
                    Salvador, we had some changeovers. Part of the time, at first it was one desk
                    officer for El Salvador and Honduras. Then we split it off and had one for El
                    Salvador and one for Honduras. Then we had a desk officer for Costa Rica. The
                    Costa Rica desk officer when we had a vacancy, the Guatemala-Belize desk officer
                    would take over Costa Rica as well. So that was the staff. There were about six
                    or seven of us dealing with Central America.</p>
                <p>Q: You know something that might be interesting, you have talked about all the
                    problems of Central America, here you are you know, United Fruit, commercial
                    interests, these are the banana republics par excellence where the United States
                    is wading in to exploit and all and you didn't mention this. Could you explain
                    this?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Because of the Carter administration's fixation on human rights, we
                    really got involved very little with the economic things at the policy level.
                    Occasionally there was some labor problem or in the case of involving some
                    government corruption, but we rarely got involved. These banana plantations had
                    been there under U.S. ownership. There were some in Guatemala, some ranch land
                    in Guatemala owned by some individuals. Also in Nicaragua there were some. The
                    principal banana plantations were in Honduras and Costa Rica. I don't remember
                    any U.S. owned banana plantations in Nicaragua. There may have been, but
                    essentially these were aside from disruptions that insurgents would make, and
                    they weren't really making them on my watch, they ran along on their own. They
                    had their own relations with the governments. They didn't cause us any real
                    problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then should we move on to the next phase.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yes, I think I have pretty well gone over Central America. Oh let me
                    mention the one thing I started on. We had a couple of task forces dealing with
                    something to do with Central America while I was there. The Sandinistas took
                    over the national assembly at one point in '78, it could have been '77. The
                    national Assembly in Nicaragua was meeting, and a Sandinista group took them
                    practically all hostage. We had a task force at that time. I was most impressed
                    on one of my trips to Nicaragua with Tony Gillespie. Tony was the Administrative
                    Counselor in Managua. When I was in there asking about one thing or another in
                    the front office, Tony would stick his head in the front office, I was told
                    perhaps oftener than he should have. I found Tony to be admirably informed about
                    everything that was going on in Nicaragua. He had some good, balanced
                    opinions.</p>
                <p>Tony came back to a job in Washington in the administrative field that he wasn't
                    terribly interested in, and we formed a task force. I suggested that Tony be
                    called over to be a shift chief of the Task force. I think Sally Shelton Colby
                    was in charge of the task force because she was the Deputy Assistant Secretary.
                    The last I heard, she was with AID as one of the Deputy Directors of AID. Sally,
                    I believe was in charge of it as normally you put a desk in charge of one of
                    those things. I think Dick Graham who was one of my Deputy Directors I had in
                    charge of one of the shifts and I asked Tony to be in charge of the other one
                    with Sally's concurrence. He said, “Yes.” I think that may have been where Tony
                    got exposure to the then people in the ARA front office because he went to the
                    ARA front office I believe while I was still there, maybe after I left as a
                    coordinator and later as a desk himself and went out to Colombia and then to
                    Chile.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was sort of involved not very heavily in the Grenada. I
                        had long interview with Tony.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I will say parenthetically about Tony, I wrote a performance report
                    about him, a memorandum, not a report, regarding his serving on the task force
                    as a shift chief, in other words in charge of the task force during one of the
                    round the clock shifts. He did a very good job on that. I said in my little
                    memorandum based on my experience with Tony in Nicaragua when I had run into him
                    on my two or three trips down there and also on the task force, my intention was
                    if I were ever so fortunate as to be named Ambassador in any country in an area
                    of Tony's and my language competence, that the first person I would call on if I
                    had a DCM choice would be Tony Gillespie. I did not get to be Ambassador and
                    Tony Gillespie did, so this was not a realistic option. I really felt very
                    strongly about Tony.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were with the BEX [Board of Examiners]. Was this
                        abou1980? How long were you with the BEX?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I was with the BEX, well I took a little leave. I had some coming
                    before I went to BEX. It was about six months temporary duty.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: No, '79, from around January or possibly after my leave,February of '79
                    until August of '79.</p>
                <p>Q: What were you doing with the BEX?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I was a regular examiner of Foreign Service officer candidates. I went
                    out to give the oral exam. I gave a number of exams in Washington. I led a team
                    to Los Angeles for three weeks, a team of three examiners, and we gave exams to
                    people from the southwestern United States. I participated on the team. I don't
                    think I was the team leader because we tried to divide it up. One person would
                    do it one time and another person another because we were all equivalent in
                    responsibility and rank, to Seattle. I think that was two weeks. I believe the
                    rest of my time was in Washington. I believe I may have gone and made a couple
                    of speeches to colleges and universities about the Foreign Service at the time.
                    They were here in the east.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>Oh while I was on the Central America wicket I made several talks on Central
                    America up in New Jersey and here and there. I attended a conference in New
                    Orleans basically focused on Honduras, and did various things of that nature
                    that were part of my duties. Back to Central America, I guess I was deemed
                    incorrigible at one point, no, I wasn't deemed incorrigible, I was deemed
                    corrigible on this human rights issue, because the United States executive
                    branch was asked to send one participant, the legislative branch was asked to
                    send another to an international conference on the state individual rights and
                    the powers and obligations of the state. Basically on human rights. Which was
                    held at the American center at the old bishop's residence at Salzburg, Austria,
                    a three week program. Sally Shelton nominated me because she felt I needed some
                    education along those lines. Sally and I disagreed on some things, but we
                    cooperated. We got along well. I think I got furious with her, and I think on
                    more than one occasion she got furious at me, but we got along. I went to that,
                    and I found that a fascinating experience. I was sort of teamed up with the
                    Americas chief of the Polish foreign ministry at the time to do some projects on
                    it. We had the Foreign Minister from Austria come down and visit us, Paul Froid.
                    He was one of our faculty from this particular program from Harvard. It was a
                    very good program. It didn't change my attitude on anything because I felt that
                    to begin with and to the end of it that human rights is definitely an element
                    that we should have in our foreign policy, but it should not be the dominant
                    element.Let me go back to one other thing. This is kind of interesting, and I'll
                    say something I could have never said while I was in the Foreign Service. I
                    heard through my sources, and I had pretty good contacts here and there. I was
                    not officially informed by State Department at all, that Shelton was going to be
                    nominated to be Ambassador to El Salvador. That was back when we had our
                    problems, when we had a lot of problems with El Salvador, of course. I felt that
                    given her background, I had never met the lady. Given her background, given her
                    age, this that and the other, that this would be an absolute horrible choice for
                    El Salvador. I felt I had a responsibility out of school to torpedo this. I
                    leaked the information to Jerry O'Leary of the Washington Star at the time. This
                    was before we could get any publicity on this at this level. Jerry wrote an
                    article saying this was a horrible choice for this, that and some other reasons.
                    Some people came up with the same thing, and the Carter administration never
                    went ahead with the nomination. Lloyd Benson of Texas was her guru of course. He
                    had known her family for a long time.</p>
                <p>Q: She'd been a staff assistant to him, and she had taught at, she spoke Spanish,
                    and she had taught in Mexico, so she wasn't on the political side without some
                    credentials. She was quite young, 32 and going to El Salvador at this time, you
                    really needed somebody that was around for a long time. It was not a place for
                    somebody to learn to be an Ambassador.</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: No, not at all. Now Sally was fluent in Spanish because she had been
                    married to a Mexican diplomat at one point, and she certainly knew Latin
                    America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was a very competent person. It just wasn't her time
                        fothat sort of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Absolutely. Anyway, for my reward, Sally was made my boss. I have
                    always been an upright person. I don't like to keep secrets. Of course, I had to
                    many times in the Foreign Service, but when Sally came on board, I believe the
                    first time I met her, I said, “Sally, I don't know whether you know but you
                    should, I want you to know, I was probably instrumental in you not getting the
                    nomination to Ambassador to El Salvador.” She said, “I knew that, Wade and she
                    said I'm glad you told me. I wondered if you would tell me.” I said, “Yes, and
                    I'll tell you why,” and I did tell her why. Having gotten off that way, we had a
                    good relationship. There were only one or two occasions where I got highly
                    annoyed with her. I remember the case; I don't remember the details. There was a
                    munitions case as to whether we should supply something. I don't remember what
                    it was. Hard to say what it was. It was certainly not definitely includable
                    under the embargo to Guatemala. I had approved it. Munitions control had
                    approved it. Everybody approved it, but I kept getting queries from Guatemala
                    what has happened to this case? I tried to trace it. I was involved in other
                    things and apparently didn't trace it very successfully. Finally when I was able
                    to trace it down, the Guatemalan government and Ambassador kept asking about it.
                    I kept saying I think it is going along well. I kept asking about it. I did tell
                    them I think, that it had been approved by the ARA bureau. I found that Sally
                    had gone in and turned it down on behalf of the ARA bureau and in fact had
                    basically over ruled me without telling me. It was always very vague about why
                    she hadn't told me, and I got absolutely furious about that. I went in and
                    complained to the Assistant Secretary, Terry Todman, because Sally left shortly
                    thereafter. Terry also seemed to believe that certainly she should have told me.
                    I think he disagreed with turning it down. In any event, it was killed and we
                    couldn't get it resurrected because the human rights bureau got involved and so
                    on. It was another irritant between us and the Guatemala bureau. That was one of
                    the only times I got annoyed with Sally. I'm sure she was annoyed with me on
                    other occasions.</p>
                <p>We are still friends. I talked with her after Bill Colby's death. We've had
                    lunches on several occasions after I left there. Another instance. She was later
                    nominated Ambassador to Barbados. It was proven that she could serve. We would
                    talk. She was up at New York at the United Nations, one of Andrew Young's
                    deputies after she left the ARA bureau. I remember Sally calling me one time
                    maybe about that or maybe it was about something else too. As I recall the
                    conversation which may be a little vague after all these years. She said, “Wade,
                    have you heard anything about me?” I said, “Yes, your pending nomination to be
                    Ambassador to Barbados.” She said, “Yes, that is it in fact. I know it is not
                    public, and I just wondered.” I said, “Yes, I have, Sally.” She said, “What do
                    you think?” I said, “Not to worry. I think you will be an excellent Ambassador
                    to Barbados. I think even at the time when I was opposed to your going to El
                    Salvador, you would have been an excellent Ambassador to Barbados.” Barbados
                    doesn't have this sexist attitude toward women in that sort of place. I think
                    the problems are not the sort of thing, we have them. I said, “I would be quite
                    willing to publicly support but that would probably be the kiss of death to your
                    nomination if I were to do so at this time.” We were joking, of course, but I
                    was very pleased with that.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>Q: With the BEX just in general what was your impression of the system for
                    selecting, the pressures on you, and the candidates you were seeing?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: The pressures were on the candidates, of course. They had a very slim
                    chance of passing. We were not supposed to pass many of them. If we did pass
                    many of them, we didn't have a technical quota. When I went to Los Angeles, for
                    example, I was told, I say told, you know we talked about this sort of thing. I
                    was told informally that hey you'd better not bring back more than three people.
                    We interviewed six a day I think, at least four a day, two every morning and at
                    least two in the afternoon. I think it may have been three every morning and
                    afternoon. I'm pretty sure it was. Six a day times three weeks. The last day or
                    so we didn't interview, but we had almost that many. We were told if you bring
                    back more than three successful candidates, you are screwing us up. You've got
                    to use this as a real screening device. Apparently they were not. Back when I
                    came in, they used the written exam as the basic screening device. I think only
                    30% or 15% passed the written. Apparently a much larger number were passing the
                    written at that time, and the oral was the real screen. I think we only brought
                    back three successful. The problems weren't in winnowing out the bottom 70%. The
                    problems were in deciding among the top 30%, and there it was sort of arbitrary.
                    We knew that some of the successful ones were not going to pass the in basket
                    test and that series of things they had just started in Washington. They
                    inevitably would.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel pressure to give special credit to being a
                        woman ominorities, blacks and Hispanics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: No real pressure. It was clear that the Department wanted to recruit
                    more not so much women at that time because women were coming in at a fairly
                    good rate, but minorities, Hispanics, blacks, Asians, American Indians, any
                    group from a minority. We didn't have that many minority candidates that had
                    gotten past the written. We had very few. We heard what they were saying, and
                    there were two candidates more or less equal, we certainly I think would have
                    given the nod to the minority candidate. My recollections are very vague here
                    and I don't know if we are talking about Seattle or Los Angeles. I remember one
                    very qualified black candidate we had who was certainly among that top 30% we
                    are talking about, and we did give the nod to him. I for the life of me can't
                    recall any others that I thought were competitive. As I say, since that top 30%,
                    it was largely subjective. Let's say the top 20%, largely subjective. We could
                    have almost flipped a coin as to some of them, certainly the top 10%, which ones
                    of those were going to be the three, so we would have undoubtedly given the nod
                    to a black, and I think we probably did.</p>
                <p>Q: I realize I am dipping back into a short period and all. Was there any part of
                    the oral exam that seemed to separate the sheep from the goats or not?</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I didn't feel that. I also supervised and judged some of the in basket
                    and full day exams again for those that passed the oral at FSI. No, I really
                    believe an oral exam if you have guidelines as to what you want, you get the
                    idea what sort of people are successful. Particularly at that time, and now too,
                    a person would be coming in as a potential administrative officer or potential
                    political officer or what have you, we had a diverse team where each one of us
                    came from a different background. My background was sort of the political
                    background. We had a person who came from a consular background and a person who
                    came from administration. We really didn't have anybody from an economic
                    background on one of my trips; we may have on the second. Those people were
                    given more weight in our deliberations on our team as to whether they would
                    pass. We didn't do it like when I came in. We made a decision immediately after
                    the interview. You ranked them and you voted without consultation, and then you
                    consulted on your final vote. You took all sorts of notes because you really
                    only took a final vote at the end of the process of the ones you would recommend
                    and what order you would put them. I thought we could tell pretty well. After
                    all, we had a lot of background on the people that they filled out these
                    forms.</p>
                <p>I remember some people I wondered why on earth they wanted to get into foreign
                    service. We had the head of a journalism department of a university in
                    Washington or Oregon who came at the age of 35 or 36. The age limits had been
                    relaxed of course by that time. Allegedly and he stuck to it, that he really
                    wanted to be a Foreign Service officer. He gave reasons. He thought he really
                    needed to move on and he wanted to come in as a junior Foreign Service officer.
                    We would bring them in now at a couple of grades below the bottom with a
                    background like that. He had a Ph.D. in journalism or something like that. He
                    didn't pass it. He was simply not competitive at the very top level. He would
                    have certainly made the top 30%. He didn't pass it. We had another case of the
                    son of a very distinguished U.S. Ambassador. I know he was still on active duty
                    at that time at several posts. We had his fiancee who applied, a woman. We were
                    not really giving preference to women first thing. Half of our acceptable
                    candidates were women, but they were successful in their own right. We didn't
                    have to give them a boost up. The son of the Ambassador did well. He was also in
                    our top 30%. We ended up passing his fiancee and flunking him. Just because she
                    was really outstanding. He did well. What happened to them, I have no idea.</p>

                <p>MATTHEWS: Educational, a lot of fun. Almost certainly more useful to some of the
                    other people than it was to me in that I had been in 49 of the 50 United States
                    already. Some of the people had not been off the East coast except for maybe San
                    Francisco or Los Angeles. I had associated with or had friends or relatives
                    really basically all over the United States. The institutions I was pretty
                    familiar with having gone to law school down in Florida and up to Tallahassee
                    and had become pretty thoroughly familiar with the Florida institutions as well
                    as a student politician with the state institutions in North Carolina, the
                    municipal governments and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>I found the most useful part of it to me was the other agency orientations,
                    visits, briefs including to the military installations and talking with people
                    in the military. You got a lot out of your classmates because we travel and just
                    in Washington you talk a lot with them. I thought it was a very worthwhile
                    project even for me and as I say more so for probably some of the others. I did
                    a paper that I enjoyed doing and I was able to vent some of my spleen in it
                    probably. The paper of course was an academic exercise so it had no policy
                    implications. It was on human rights and the national interest. You have to have
                    a good colon for an academic paper, colon, our policy in Central America and the
                    Philippines. I elected that topic because obviously I was thoroughly familiar
                    with our human rights policy in Central America. I thought it was a failure. It
                    was not working. I thought it was much better when you realized at the
                    beginning, and I played off this, Central America was a throw away area except
                    for human rights idea of the incoming Carter administration which I opposed. I
                    thought the Philippines was a good counterfoil, a good way to look at an area
                    where we clearly had some other interests, strong military interests at the
                    time. With our Asian interests, Central America was sort of our base there. Our
                    military interests were very strong. The immigration interests, the Philippine
                    element of the U.S. population was stronger at that time than the Central
                    American element of the U.S. population. Our commercial interests, our
                    investments in the Philippines were much more significant than our investments
                    in Central America, so it was obvious we had other interests. You couldn't say
                    human rights is going to be our lead interest in the Philippines. My bottom line
                    was because of that lack of fixation on human rights our other interests and our
                    human rights interests were much better served by U.S. policy in the
                    Philippines. By the way, we carried out policy in Central America. the U.S.
                    government did. I thought I made logical arguments in the paper. The paper was
                    looked at and distributed and nobody had time to read it who was in the policy
                    making and besides well with 20-20 hindsight you can probably see that and
                    others would say absolutely not. We should have pushed human rights stronger in
                    the Philippines. Our military interests aren't really that important. We
                    eventually gave up our military interests there. Of course we hadn't at that
                    time, the bases.</p>

                <p>MATTHEWS: I was up for assignment. I had hopes that I would get an Ambassadorial
                    post. I was not lobbying for a DCM post. I should have realized that as long as
                    the Carter administration was there, there was no way I was going to get an
                    Ambassadorial post. I made a few desultory attempts for it. It got nowhere. I
                    was not desperate though; I had my lines out. I am pretty sure I could have
                    gotten a DCM job. I didn't want to go back to Washington to stay in Washington.
                    I wanted to go overseas.</p>
                <p>I got a telephone call from Ray Gonzales who was Ambassador to Ecuador, who had
                    been my boss in Peru saying, “Wade, we have got consul general at Guayaquil
                    coming open. Would you be interested in putting your name on the line for it. If
                    so, I would certainly support you for it.” I said, “That is interesting, Ray. I
                    have never had my own post.” It was the largest city in Ecuador. It operated to
                    a certain extent independent from the embassy insofar as a major consulate
                    general does. It was the center of the political life iEcuador where the then
                    president of Ecuador, Rodos, came from. It was the headquarters of the navy of
                    Ecuador. For some purely personal having nothing to do with work reasons; I've
                    always been a zoologist at heart. I think I mentioned I have a bachelors in it,
                    and the Galapagos islands were in my consulate. I could get out there on
                    official business if nothing else while I was there. After thinking about it for
                    a day or so, I called Ray back and said, “Yes I'd be delighted to go to
                    Guayaquil.” I put in my application and the assignment went through and I got
                    there I suppose it was July. It was right before the national day. They wanted
                    me to host the national day reception. I don't remember. It was around the
                    national day reception in 1980.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: '80-'82. Two years almost to the day. Maybe a few daymore or less.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Guayaquil and Ecuador in 1980, what was the situation
                        there froyour perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: A thoroughly democratic regime. The person who would have been elected
                    president of Ecuador was essentially kept out by the military. The man was Assad
                    Bucharan who was of Lebanese origin. The military claimed perhaps truly that he
                    had not been born in Ecuador. He had been born in Lebanon. His parents had
                    brought him there as a young child. Assad Bucharan produced various documents
                    showing that he had been born in Ecuador, and his parents had immigrated before
                    he was born. There were other documents indicating the reverse. It was unclear.
                    Forged documents are easy to come by on either side. Obviously one side or the
                    other forged the documents, probably both of them. Maybe there were no documents
                    about whether he had been born in Ecuador or outside. This happened before I got
                    there. Assad Bucharan said, “Well, if they won't let me be president of Ecuador,
                    I will be effective president of Ecuador through one of my deputies.” He picked
                    the deputy that he thought was most reliable because he was married to Assad's
                    daughter.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>Assad Bucharan was the President, the CFT I think was the name of the party. I
                    can't recall what the initials stand for now. Anyway he said if the military
                    won't let me be president of Ecuador, I believe he had actually been elected
                    president at one time and they kept him from taking office, but now it was
                    unfashionable for the military to move in and depose a president who has been
                    elected, so they said no he was born outside of Ecuador so he can't be. So, he
                    put up a man named Rodos who had started out as his gopher, his deputy who had
                    fallen in love with or arranged or what have you to marry Assad's daughter. So
                    here his son in law Rodos was nominated by the CFT party that Assad controlled
                    pretty tightly as the nominee of the principal populist party of Ecuador. and
                    Rodos was elected. In the election campaign in fact one of the mottoes this was
                    even on some of the posters I think was Rodos to the presidency Bucharan in
                    power. Everybody knew that Rodos would follow Assad's orders. After the election
                    Assad said I want so and so to be Minister of Foreign Affairs and so an so to be
                    Minister of Interior. Rodos said, “Wait a minute I'm President of Ecuador; you
                    aren't. I will decide who will be Minister of Foreign Affairs and this that and
                    the other.” There was a firm and serious break between the two. Rodos I don't
                    know whether he was expelled from the party or resigned from the party, but the
                    party was still controlled by Assad Bucharan, but Rodos was the president. Rodos
                    of course forged a coalition with others up in Quito. The Vice president had a
                    different party. Assad Bucharan was in strong opposition to Rodos when I
                    arrived. This was the scene, the setting.</p>
                <p>Democracy, strong influence by the military, chronic problems with Peru which had
                    been along ever since before W.W.II when Peru took land that Ecuador claimed.
                    There was an unstable border. There had been incidents with Peru over the past
                    years. The U.S. was one of the guaranteeing powers of the border, the U.S. and
                    the other guarantor powers I think Brazil, Argentina and maybe Chile, all the
                    ABC powers and the United States. If it was four power or just three power I
                    don't remember. We guaranteed it and our interest was in keeping the border area
                    quiet, demarcating the border to the extent we could. I was involved in that,
                    demarcating the border, back in the OAS. That was one of the issues and I got
                    involved in that. It still wasn't solved and there had been at least two minor
                    border wars. There was one while I was there. Okay, that was another issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>Tuna boat seizures were a big issue while I was there between us and the
                    Ecuadorians. We and Ecuador interpreted the 200 mile limits, the limits for tuna
                    very differently. The United States was moving to the position whereby a 200
                    mile economic zone may be glued to it by that time, I don't remember, I think we
                    had, which was okay. That was Ecuador's position for a long time. Pacific Tuna
                    were a highly migratory species. Pacific tuna did not fall under the 200 mile
                    economic zone; they were an exception. Ecuador said a 200 mile zone is a 200
                    mile zone. Why don't you have the Atlantic tuna which have the same migratory
                    patterns though in a different area as the Pacific tuna excluded from the 200
                    mile zone. You and the United States because Atlantic tuna would be fished by
                    factory ships, if you treated them as you did the Pacific tuna, but your sport
                    fisherman want Atlantic tuna to survive in the 200 mile economic zone, therefore
                    you exclude them as not a highly migratory fish. But, in the Pacific area, you
                    say they are a highly migratory fish. The Ecuadorian argument was completely
                    correct on the personal situation. I got involved in the with the National
                    Marine Fisheries Institute and others from the way they migrated and the way
                    they acted, if one is highly migratory, the other is highly migratory. It was
                    purely the self interest of the United States that was keeping it this way. That
                    was not what I could tell the Ecuadorians, and I didn't. On this one I was a
                    good boy. I didn't go and say, I said well there are differences and so on.
                    Anyway this was a problem.</p>
                <p>They seized some of our tuna vessels. This happened occasionally while I was
                    there, and I got involved in one case that maybe I'll mention as an illustration
                    out in the Galapagos of how things went. The U.S. tuna interests, some of the
                    canning companies there were, one of them at least was American owned.</p>
                <p>We had U.S. banana plantations. Ecuador is the worlds number one banana exporter.
                    Not producer, Brazil produces far more. Some of those plantations were owned by
                    U.S. corporate or individual owners. Ecuador was a relatively minor exporter of
                    petroleum, but still an exporter. U.S. companies were involved in the
                    exploration for and production of and pipeline of petroleum from Ecuador. That
                    was another interest. And we had the military cooperation too. It was a
                    democratic regime, and we had fairly close cooperation with the Ecuadorian
                    military and the Bolivian military. Part of the reason was we wanted to maintain
                    good relations with both so if another border war flared up, we would then have
                    some influence on both sides.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's talk about your relations with the embassy. How did this work out? Did
                    the ambassador remain Gonzales? How did he operate and how did he use you?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Ray was the Ambassador the entire time I was there up until toward the
                    end when he left and turned it over to John Ewell who was DCM at the time.
                    Technically I was under the DCM. In fact, I operated pretty well under the
                    ambassador. The DCM wrote my performance report, I don't remember. The
                    ambassador had a strong influence on my performance report.</p>

                <p>MATTHEWS: I had no problem. I had two Deputy Chiefs of Mission while I was there.
                    I had no problem with either one. They basically let me run my show as I wanted
                    to, under the guidance of the ambassador of course. The ambassador and I had no
                    problems whatsoever. I would go up when I went to Quito, I would usually stay at
                    the ambassador's residence unless he was out of town or doing something else in
                    which case obviously, I was at the DCM's residence. I would go up about once a
                    month for two reasons. One I needed to participate in an occasional staff
                    meeting and confer about various issues which I couldn't confer on over the
                    telephone. Two, to make sure I knew where things were going and how things were
                    going there and so they could get my input on things in Quito. A secondary
                    reason my oldest daughter when I went to Ecuador was going to college in the
                    United States and in my second year in Ecuador she was doing her sophomore year
                    abroad at the University of Salamanca in Spain. I guess she did come down for
                    our Galapagos trip over the Christmas holidays, a private trip to Galapagos, the
                    first time I went there. My other two kids were up at Quito. My middle daughter
                    was doing her final two years in high school in Quito. It was an American
                    language school actually at Guayaquil, actually bilingual but that's all right.
                    They both spoke Spanish too, but we wanted them in an American system school</p>
                <p>The best American system school in Ecuador was the Alliance Academy run by the
                    missionary alliance up in Quito, so we enrolled both of them in that school. It
                    was an interesting experience for them. Both of them were agnostics at the time
                    they began. The son was still an agnostic at the time he left, but they lived in
                    the Assembly of God house. I said, “Hey, this is going to be a great experience
                    for you because you probably have had that element of your education neglected,
                    and you are going to get a heavy dose of fundamentalist Protestant religion
                    while you are there.” Believe me they did. I think almost the entire day was
                    taken up by church, Sunday school, prayer meetings, vespers, prayer before every
                    meal, Bible discussions. They learned their Bible while they were up there. So
                    anyway that's why I went to Quito.</p>
                <p>Q: Picking up some of the issues. In the first place, what was your impression of
                    the government you were dealing with in Guayaquil both the competence, how they
                    felt about America and some of the issues you had to deal with?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: The government was friendly and cooperative. Ecuador unlike Brazil was
                    not a federal republic. Ecuador has a central government. The governors were
                    appointed by the national government. In the local government the only
                    independent power there was the mayor of Guayaquil. There was also an attendant
                    who was appointed. Quito pretty much controlled him, but Guayaquil's importance
                    was the majority, the largest party in the country was based in Guayaquil, and
                    Guayaquil was a larger city than Quito.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>Guayaquil was also the commercial center of the country. Most of the commerce,
                    most of the industry was in the Guayaquil area not the Quito area. There were
                    distinctive elements of the population. Even the language was differently
                    accented. It was Spanish in both places. There were some Quechua speakers up in
                    the mountains but unlike Peru where I would say a majority of the mountain
                    Indians spoke Quechua as their principal language. Quechua was the principal
                    language of a minority but a substantial minority of the Indians up in the
                    mountains. I would say 40% something of that nature. The rest would speak
                    Spanish. Mostly in the cities you heard far more Spanish than Quechua. On the
                    coast you hardly ever heard Quechua. There was some rivalry in the old feeling.
                    The populations were almost equal between my consulate district and the
                    consulate district of Quito, about half the population of the country in each
                    one. The coastal Ecuadorians called those from around Quito whether they were
                    Indian or not derogatorily as Indus. The mountain Indians around Quito called
                    the coastal Indians, the coastal population, “monos,” monkeys. You had the
                    monkeys and the Indians and both terms were about equally appropriate at the
                    time. There was a rivalry.</p>
                <p>The army tended to be dominated by the Quitanios, the mountain Ecuadorians; the
                    navy tended to be dominated by the coastal Ecuadorians. There was rivalry there
                    and there was rivalry commercially among the banks and every other way. Shortly
                    after I arrived, I went around and made my calls and contacted everybody. In
                    fact the arrival was illustrative about some of the meetings. I arrived one
                    weekend day, and it turned out it was on the day of the annual navy day, and the
                    naval attach� a very highly qualified completely bilingual fellow of Cuban
                    origin was there and had come down for the navy day. He invited me to go with
                    him to the big navy celebration. I got there after the formal ceremonies, but
                    they had a big party that evening at the naval club down there. All the navy
                    brass was there including the admiral who was the head of the navy. I went with
                    him, and it turned out to be an all night affair. I think I had just got off the
                    plane. It literally went on all night long. We were celebrating at the naval
                    place, not getting too inebriated, more pressing the flesh and meeting all those
                    people, and he knew all the people so he introduced me to everybody. We ended up
                    having breakfast at the commander of the navy's house. I remember his wife
                    insisted, “No, you are not going to the table to get the breakfast. We women
                    always do that.” Before she got her husband's plate or anybody else's, she
                    filled a plate full of eggs and ham and whatever and brought it back to me. I
                    thought it was a nice gesture by the head of the Ecuadorian navy. Anyway, that
                    is how I got started.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>The first week or so I made my calls. Assad Bucharan who I called on said he
                    really needed to get together with me and talk with me privately about Rodos. I
                    invited him and the then president of the chamber of deputies who is basically
                    one of his deputies. He may have took Rodos' place as principal assistant. We
                    spent the whole lunch at my house just the three of us. I had my servants serve
                    the lunch. My wife hadn't arrived yet. She was getting my oldest daughter
                    established in college and arranging some things back in Washington, so I was
                    there by myself. Assad spent the whole time trying to convince me with support
                    when possible from the president of the chamber that Rodos was a crypto
                    communist. He was really a communist, that he had pulled the wool over Assad's
                    eyes all these years, and the United States should strongly oppose Rodos and get
                    him out of the Presidency of Ecuador as soon as possible. Of course it was all
                    nonsense, all hogwash. Rodos was I would say sort of a middle of the roader. He
                    supported us on some things and opposed us on other things. Clearly opposed us
                    on the tuna policy which is quite understandable. He was a little more
                    nationalistic than we would have desired, but not much so. We certainly got good
                    relations with Rodos, and Rodos with former political counselor of Ecuador whose
                    name is escaping me now, a Foreign Service officer. When Rodos came to
                    Washington during the campaign, he stayed at this guy's house. Good relations,
                    nothing sub rosa, nothing illicit at all, but they were just good personal
                    friends. This fellow I had talked with as part of my briefings in Washington,
                    and he gave me a lot of very favorable information about Rodos and he was an
                    excellent choice for President of Ecuador and so on. I told Assad, “He is the
                    president of Ecuador. We want to work with the president of Ecuador. I hear what
                    you are saying, but you have still got to convince me that he is a crypto
                    communist before I start agreeing.” The relations were good. The governor of
                    Guyas province, his wife worked at the Embassy as a secretary.</p>
                <p>Guayaquil was in some respects a dangerous place to be in some respects for
                    crime, not for any real well yes later for terrorism but not because of
                    terrorism per se most of the time. A lot of people carried guns. I set the
                    weapons policy so later on I tended to carry one around myself because I didn't
                    want my bodyguards to be with me all the time. They had a home life and I didn't
                    feel there was any great danger. The governor, Guido, had standing instructions.
                    People were supposed to be relieved of their weapons at the desk before they
                    called on him, but I said, “Guido is always not to be relieved of his weapon
                    when he comes by to talk with me.” Guido would come up to talk with me. He
                    carried a little shaving kit, a little tiny case. He would take the shaving kit
                    out and put it down on the coffee table in front of us whenever we talked. We
                    had good relations.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the tuna war went on between really the west coast shipping
                    interests who had tremendous political clout in the United States and Ecuador.
                    It has finally been resolved. I'm not sure how, but at the time I take it this
                    was at the height of the tuna war or was it? It was going on. Can you talk about
                    cases during your '80-'82 period what we did and your feeling about the
                    pressures that came from political clout the group had in California and
                    Seattle?</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Tuna, while it didn't take a great deal of my time, it did sometimes
                    develop into a crisis where for a period of some days would take a lot of my
                    time. We had developed a sort of accommodation with the Ecuadorian navy which
                    was essential for keeping any sort of tuna thing down. We tried to develop an
                    accommodation with I can't remember the name of the organization now. The U.S.
                    tuna fleet was based in San Diego, and the U.S. tuna fleet was predominately a
                    long range tuna fleet. They did their fishing in the Southeast Pacific. They
                    didn't do usually a great deal of fishing in Ecuadorian waters except transient
                    fishing. They would go to the south Pacific where they would catch tuna and set
                    on dolphin. They would spot the dolphin from a helicopter that was based on the
                    tuna boat. The tuna boat would then go and surround the whole school of tuna and
                    dolphin where they would just kill the dolphin. The dolphin would be suffocated.
                    By the time I got there, dolphin preservation measures had been put into place
                    and they had to have boards on the nets and they had to put some people in the
                    water and they would travel with little motor boats inside the nets and hurry
                    the dolphin which tended to stay higher than tuna out of the nets and then bring
                    the boards off and haul in the nets and get this huge amount of tuna. It was an
                    expensive sort of operation but they caught one hell of a lot of tuna. Most of
                    the Ecuadorian fleet on the other hand was shore based. The boats tended to be
                    smaller. They generally set on dolphin but not entirely. Sometimes they would
                    just set on tuna and try to pick them us in their fish finders. Sometimes they
                    would set on dolphin. Much of their catch was bought by an American owned
                    cannery in Ecuador and exported to the United States and other places. There
                    were several Ecuadorian canneries plus of course a certain frozen fresh tuna
                    market as well. Some was flown to Japan. Tuna was a big thing in Ecuador from
                    the national pride and economic reasons as well. We had sort of worked out an
                    accommodation with the Ecuadorian navy. They would not vigorously look for U.S.
                    tuna boats. The U.S. tuna fleet would also generally not deliberately go to
                    Ecuadorian waters, but hey they are going through Ecuadorian waters anyway to
                    get from the Panamanian area and other areas to the South PacifiYou are not
                    going to prevent them from dipping their nets in the water and fishing for tuna
                    sending the helicopter up and if they spot some. They didn't stay there for a
                    lengthy period of time. It was sort of an accommodation, more accommodating on
                    the Ecuadorian side than on the U.S. tuna association side. Occasionally there
                    would be an incident. Occasionally a U.S. tuna boat would be caught.</p>
                <p>One incident that is probably illustrative of what happened though it is a unique
                    incident because of where it took place. A U.S. tuna boat was coming back from
                    fishing southwest of Ecuadorian waters in the Galapagos. The Ecuadorian navy
                    which normally couldn't patrol these seas around the Galapagos just happened to
                    have its flagship and its second largest ship that were going to the Galapagos
                    from the mainland in Ecuador. They just happened to be steaming along and they
                    saw this tuna boat. They thought they saw the tuna boat with its nets in the
                    water at first and then the nets came up or maybe they didn't. That was
                    uncertain. It was well within Ecuadorian water. It really if it had been prudent
                    should have gone another way. It was just traveling. Maybe it had been fishing;
                    maybe it hadn't. It was traveling like this at one point and here come the two
                    Ecuadorian boats.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They already menace is on the radio, they can't see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: The tuna boat was going northeast. The Ecuadorian flagship and the
                    other vessel were going northwest. The Ecuadorian nave people saw it and said
                    there is nothing out there is there. In other words they were going to ignore it
                    because it was clearly not fishing at least at this point. The tuna boat, idiots
                    that they were, got on the radio, they were basically Portuguese fisherman. They
                    spoke Spanish or not Spanish to communicate, and said, “Should we heave to?”
                    What could the Ecuadorian navy people say? “Of course, yes, heave to.” So they
                    heave to. The Ecuadorian navy people went and inspected them. They found some
                    very fresh tuna which almost certainly came from Ecuadorian waters. They said,
                    “Follow us into the nearest port,” which was San Cristobal in the Galapagos
                    Islands. They followed them into the nearest port. They communicated with the
                    navy headquarters. Navy headquarters got through to the Ministry of Natural
                    Resources. Marcello Andramo who was the director of fisheries said, “I am
                    hopping the next plane to the Galapagos Islands. We are going to have a trial
                    and fine these bastards,” because he was gung ho. He was not for any, I knew
                    Marcello fairly well.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>Marcello Andramo was Director of Fisheries. He had gotten his job as director of
                    fisheries because he had been Rodos' chauffeur. He knew where all the bodies
                    were buried, mistresses were hidden, this, that and the other. He was Director
                    of Fisheries. He didn't know a damn thing about fisheries. He suddenly started
                    buying shrimp lands and establishing shrimp farms that sort of thing. I got a
                    call from the Embassy saying, “You have got a problem in your consular district.
                    You had better get out and see what is going on.” I made a reservation on a
                    commercial flight. At first they said, “We are trying to fix this up. Your
                    message to Marcello Andramo who hasn't called the office is that Paul Touralura
                    who is the Director of natural resources and a sensible person and who was under
                    orders from the President. Call Touralura before you do anything.” I hopped the
                    plane, flew out to the Galapagos. I think you get off on Balzar Island. I had to
                    take a bus and then a ferry over. Oh the Ecuadorian navy was going to cooperate
                    with me in getting me to San Cristobal where the trial was supposed to be
                    scheduled for the next day or maybe two days later. So, I got to Balzar, took a
                    bus, hopped a ferry, took another bus down to Santa Cruz which is the principal
                    city on the main island if you will although not the most populous island. San
                    Cristobal was still 150 miles away. I went by the navy installation expecting
                    they would have a boat for me; they said they would. I found the lieutenant in
                    charge of it taking a swim. I think they had two enlisted men and one officer
                    there. He said, “I never heard anything about any navy boat that is supposed to
                    give you any sort of assistance.” Nobody in the navy knew anything about it out
                    there. The flagship and the other boat were still there. So, we got on the radio
                    and he and I were both talking with them there to the head of the Ecuadorian
                    navy flagship. They were at a dinner with the governor. Andramo wasn't around
                    either. They didn't know where he was. He was dead drink somewhere on San
                    Christabel. Nobody knew anything. Somewhere a voice cropped in and said look if
                    the Ecuadorian navy will let us in this slightly accented Spanish, obviously a
                    native Portuguese and English speaker, for me of course the speaker was the
                    captain of the tuna boat. Because the trial was supposed to start the day after
                    and there was no way I could get commercially to the island on time. “We'd be
                    glad to send our helicopter out and pick up the Consul General if the Ecuadorian
                    navy will let us. We will leave a hostage behind if they want to, to guarantee
                    we are not going to flee.” The helicopter couldn't reach the island; they would
                    have to go halfway to let the helicopter get on. The flagship of the Ecuadorian
                    navy steamed out with the tuna boat in custody, and steamed halfway over. Early
                    the following morning a helicopter took off from the tuna boat to the island
                    where I was. This is the fifth helicopter that had landed on the island in the
                    previous seven years, so there was a big to do. I was a little uncertain where
                    they were going to land, but the Ecuadorian navy man said there weren't too many
                    wires around the football field so that was the best place for them to land. At
                    the crack of dawn I was up there. The helicopter I heard coming in. The crowd
                    was all on the field. The Ecuadorian navy man and I were doing our best to shoo
                    them to the sidelines to give them enough room to land. The helicopter landed. I
                    ran out and said hurry. The people started coming out and whom up into the blue
                    went the helicopter. Then we went out to try to find the boat. It was a little
                    difficult to find the boat. We were in a tiny little helicopter, bubble on the
                    front. I'll tell you the boat was the smallest I have ever seen. We were trying
                    to get altitude and it was a little bit foggy, and we couldn't find them and I
                    was wondering if we were ever going to make it. My Foreign Service career would
                    end right there. We finally found it, this tiny little speck down below and
                    landed on it, a platform less than the size of this room, about this big. The
                    captain welcomed me aboard. He said, “I'm going to give you my quarters and bunk
                    in with the crew.” He had a spacious cabin at least the size of this room.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are in a room about 25' by 15'.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: He had a big king sized bed, color television and videotapes, half
                    pornographic movies, which I resisted watching because I had to study up on my
                    briefs as we steamed back into port. We got there in time for the hearing. I did
                    my best to get in touch with Andramo who was still not available. He was drunk
                    or had a hangover. We got to Andramo before the hearing began. I said, “Look,
                    we've got to talk.” I said, “Touralour who was his boss wants you to call her
                    before the hearing begins.” I said, “There has been considerable government
                    interest in this and I know they have instructions for you.” His instructions
                    were not to make an issue of this. If you do find them guilty, do a nominal fine
                    or perhaps find them innocent, this, that and the other. Well, the hearing was
                    held. He refused to call home. The tuna people can patch you through San Diego
                    and you can talk on a telephone because they have that capacity. I'm positive
                    the navy can do it for you too with one of their ship, and they could. So he
                    found them guilty and he fined them two million dollars. So, my mission was a
                    failure. I took a commercial transport back. I forget how I got to, anyway they
                    flew an attach� plane down. On the appeal, this fine was reduced to something
                    like $750. Everything ended well, but in the meantime, the tuna boat was
                    escorted back under custody to Ecuador. The cargo was taken off which was worth
                    $100,000 or so, a substantial amount of money. That was the real fine. The
                    crisis was averted with this minor fine which the tuna association after they
                    knew the circumstances, that they hove to voluntarily and asked if they should
                    heave to, that this was pretty idiotic. It turned out the captain told me that
                    this was an inadvertent query that went out from an unauthorized source.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a modus vivendi on this. Did you get involved at
                        alin the banana business or did that take care of itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: It pretty well took care of itself. We were very involved in the drug
                    business, that is the interdiction business. One illustration of how bad it was
                    going from Peru to Ecuador, you see coca was not really grown in Ecuador.
                    Ecuador was a transit country between Peru and Bolivia where it was grown, there
                    was a little bit grown but it was negligible, and Colombia. The Colombian Mafia
                    was deeply involved in this. Talking about bananas, there was one banana
                    plantation that I visited that is illustrative of the problems. The American
                    said, “Oh here is our airport.” He joked and said “I could really make some
                    money off of this if I wanted to.” I said, “How's that?” He said, “We use it
                    only sporadically when we have a flight. Normally nobody is there. It is just a
                    strip. A person called on me and said look, are you going to be using your
                    airstrip tomorrow night or whatever.” “No, why?” He said, “We'd like to rent the
                    airstrip from you for the night. There is a plane coming in about dusk. It will
                    be gone by dawn. There is $10,000 in it for you if you will let us rent it for
                    the night.” He said, “No, I'm sorry.” He obviously knew what they wanted it for.
                    “You might have to make sure that some other people aren't there and give them a
                    little money. We'll give you $10,000 plus $10,000 more for expenses.” He turned
                    it down, but that is illustrative of the problem. We had three DEA agents
                    assigned to my consulate at Guayaquil. They operated very closely with the
                    Ecuadorian counter narcotics service. As always when you have such a situation,
                    some people are corruptible, and with the source of money we are talking about
                    it was very difficult for them not to be. Our people were not. I'm absolutely
                    convinced they were straight shooters. Some of the people they dealt with were
                    straight shooters; some weren't. They would generally participate in busts. They
                    were always instructed to stay on the outskirts. The bureau was not to get
                    involved in the actual stopping and searching and interdiction of drugs. They
                    were authorized to carry weapons essentially routinely. Everybody in Ecuador
                    carried a weapon practically. We never had any real problems with that.</p>
                <p>We also had another agency represented. We had a USIA officer assigned. We had a
                    department of commerce officer assigned because it was the commercial center of
                    the place. We had a large consular operation which was subject to all sorts of
                    fraud pressures for visas. I don't remember how many officers we had. It seems
                    we had about five officers in our consular section, and my deputy was the head
                    of our consular section. While I was there the commercial officer and I set up
                    an American chamber of, help set it up. We didn't set it up; there was a local
                    businessman who was a fine person setting it up, and we cooperated in setting up
                    an American Chamber of Commerce in Guayaquil which was very successful and got
                    underway quite well.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>The consular operations were a frequien; well, I got involved only peripherally.
                    The first year I was there I had an excellent consular officer. All I had to say
                    was right on, do more of it. The second year I had an excellent consular officer
                    when he was sober. Unfortunately he would go on an occasional binge and get to
                    be withdrawn. I forget his name, but when he was sober, he was excellent. We had
                    an American citizenship officer who was a black woman who was very good at what
                    she did. We had eight or so American prisoners there, most of them on drug
                    charges, two of whom strongly preferred to serve out their term in Ecuador
                    rather than go back to the United States. Understandable because they had bought
                    the concession for the restaurant and snack bar at the prison. A woman and her
                    current husband and her former husband, they were all in there on drug charges,
                    middle aged people. They were doing very well because of the money they were
                    making on the restaurant. The relatives of the prisoners, the prostitutes, the
                    wives and so on, could come in and have little hours of intimacy in the prison.
                    The woman and her current husband who had the contract for the prison had a room
                    with a key that they could lock right there in the prison. They had a color
                    television set and a color VCR, all the accouterments of home, living better
                    than they ever lived in the United States. They didn't have their liberty. They
                    had a staff that ran the restaurant. Any prisoner with money could go through
                    and get served. They also had a bar if you wanted. If you had money coming in
                    from the outside, you could eat fairly well and live fairly well. So, they
                    didn't complain. The way they kept order in the place, two things were outlawed.
                    Homosexual conduct in the prison (After all, they did allow women to come in and
                    moments of intimacy) and violence were completely outlawed. If you engaged in
                    either of those two activities, you were thrown in the hole with the other
                    homosexuals and violent people, and people did not like to be thrown in the
                    hole. It was sort of a dungeon. You were thrown in there with a pair of pants
                    and you came out usually with sore body openings. That was not a pleasant
                    experience, so people tried to stay out of the hole. As a result, there was very
                    little violence in the prison.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any problem at this point with the cold war still going on,
                    particularly Cuba and all? Were you keeping your eye out for communist influence
                    other than the president of the state?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yes and no. The Embassy was looking at that more than I was. There
                    wasn't much in Ecuador. There were some local communists that ran around, but it
                    wasn't a big problem in Ecuador. The U.S. government wasn't very concerned about
                    it.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find yourself still sort of holding on the advent of Ronald Reagan as
                    President. It was a kind of shock to a lot of people who had seen him in the
                    movies and all and his reputation of being an extreme right-winger and all. Did
                    you have a problem explaining Ronald Reagan during the time you were in
                    Guayaquil?</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Not particularly. I did explain him if you will in meetings with a
                    number of people. At the time I was dean of the consular corps also which meant
                    I explained him to a lot of honorary consuls who were prominent businessmen,
                    this, that and the other. I had no problem doing that. A lot of them were
                    delighted that Ronald Reagan had been elected. The people in Guayaquil
                    particularly those who were concerned with politics were basically on the right,
                    and they felt that Carter was a nincompoop and he didn't know what was going on
                    and so forth and they were 100% in favor of Ronald Reagan.</p>
                <p>Amusing story. I was down in the jungles of Eastern Ecuador on election day when
                    Ronald Reagan was elected. I flew back that afternoon first from the jungle to
                    Quito and then from Quito down to Guayaquil. While I was in the jungle, I had
                    been to a little Indian settlement. As a diplomat I decided I would do as they
                    did, and they passed around their big brass bowl of Chicha. Chicha,
                    incidentally, depending on where you are, is a different drink. It is a
                    fermented grape drink in the Andes. Down in the jungle it is a fermented cassava
                    drink. The cassava is taken by the Indians and beaten. Before it has the poison
                    beaten out of it, the women sit around and chew it and then they spit it out
                    into the pot. The liquid from this is fermented by the saliva and so on. I have
                    a cast iron stomach. I'm never sick. They passed the bowl around and even my
                    guide feigned drinking. Some other people did. A couple of people took a drink
                    and of course the Indians were drinking. I never tasted it, so I took a nice
                    drink. By the time we got back to Ecuador with the traditional election eve
                    thing at the binational center with all the televisions and the people who were
                    nominated and the president of the chamber of Deputies... Not the same one, a
                    different President of the Chamber. It was over so early nobody came. All the
                    big wigs knew how it was. We had a big election celebration and had very few
                    people. The only people to come that the press people could find to interview of
                    note were the president of the chamber who was from Guayaquil and myself. So
                    anyway, I was put on first. The President of the Chamber and I were there. He
                    was watching me. Pancho, the President and I were pretty good friends. He was
                    also the CFP for the party. He was sort of sitting there making faces at me as I
                    was being interviewed, answering questions like what does Ronald Reagan's
                    election mean this, that and the other. I thought I was doing a fairly decent
                    job of explaining it. He was shaking his head saying you're crazy just to throw
                    me off stride, deliberately. I was looking forward to being able to do the same
                    thing for him when he started being interviewed by the television station. Then
                    suddenly my stomach started going round and round, and I had an uncontrollable
                    urge to go to the bathroom. I stopped the television interview. Right as soon as
                    I finished I got up and quickly ran and everything happened. I got back just as
                    Pancho's interview was finishing. Pancho approached me and I was saying god if
                    only I could have been there to get him back like he got me, not loudly but
                    gestures. “Wade, I never knew you wee that much of a fan of Jimmy Carter. You
                    looked like you lost your best friend when Ronald Reagan was elected. When you
                    were up there being interviewed by the television, you really looked bad.”</p>
                <p>Q: Did you get involved in the Galapagos Islands other than visiting it? Is this
                    a tourist area? I would imagine cruise ships would come in. Did this cause
                    problems or anything?</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: The Ecuadorians would not allow cruise ships to come in. They had three
                    ships that were passenger ships, relatively small, the Santa Cruz, the Bucanero
                    and I forget the name of the third, that had a license to take tourists to the
                    Galapagos. Otherwise it was just local folks that had a maximum capacity of 25
                    people. Each one had to be accompanied by a licensed naturalist, usually
                    Ecuadorian, to go with them to make sure that they cleaned up their trash and
                    that they didn't bother the animals too much. The naturalists were pretty good.
                    They knew their stuff. I went out on the Bucanero, a private trip, which was one
                    of the three ships, the middle sized one. Owned incidentally 50% of them by an
                    American who lived in Ecuador and who later became a character actor in
                    Hollywood for old sea captains. He played the part beautifully. We were
                    concerned, particularly myself, concerned about wildlife and natural
                    preservation of the environment and so on. I cooperated with a number of U.S.
                    operations, gave them whatever facultative assistance and contacts I could. I
                    actively supported the Charles Darwin Foundation based in the U.S. and on the
                    Galapagos Islands. There is a research center there. I tried to lobby to the
                    extent I could with the government of Ecuador for the protection of wildlife.
                    The problem was local fishermen and population increase on the Galapagos. That
                    was where the problem came from. It has been a mixed story since then. Basically
                    the unique wildlife has been preserved, but there are pollution problems and
                    population problems and other problems. The Galapagos didn't take up much of my
                    time.</p>

                <p>MATTHEWS: Let me mention a couple of things. We had a binational center there. We
                    had a limited amount of what you might call terrorism while we were there. That
                    was a problem. I was dean of the consulate corps one year while I was there.
                    Most of my second year. Deanship, that is an interesting and maybe unique
                    institution. Not completely unique, but usually a consular corps is at large
                    posts excludes the honorary consuls. In Guayaquil at one point it had there were
                    seven or eight missions represented by career diplomats in Guayaquil. There were
                    about 32 or 33 honorary consuls in Guayaquil. They decided several years before
                    I got there that they would combine the two consular corps, and it was working
                    pretty well. The problem with combining the consular corps is that you can no
                    longer have seniority. They decided that each year it would alternate. One year
                    it would be a career, the next an honorary. It would be done by election with
                    everybody voting for the person whether the person was career or honorary. What
                    it meant was the honorary consuls had the majority say in who the dean would be
                    even when it was the career consul's turn. I wasn't sure that all the correct
                    consuls agreed with this, but so what. So a delegation came to me after I had
                    been there a few months and said would I be willing to take it even though I had
                    only been there six months the next year. I, of course, said, “Let me think
                    about it,” and I went to my secretary, who was the best secretary I have ever
                    had in the Foreign Service overseas. Patricia Gaskell was her name. She had been
                    brought up in Ecuador, born an American citizen. She was completely bilingual
                    and could take dictation in either language and transcribe in either language
                    and what have you. She was a humdinger of a secretary. She said quite like I
                    expected her to, “Let me talk with the current consular corps secretary.” They
                    had a full time secretary hired by the honorary consul who was the owner of the
                    principal department store who had inherited the consulship from her husband.
                    Her husband had originally gotten it because one time he had helped a Haitian
                    student who was from a good family but had gotten into trouble in Ecuador. So
                    she was a lifetime honorary consul of Haiti. She talked with this other
                    secretary and came back and said, “Yes, I think I can do consular corps work. It
                    was about half an hour a day.” It was not full time, and she said she'd be happy
                    to do that. “Fine I'll accept.” The year I got into that, talking about
                    terrorism, because the Haitian consul, I believe after I was there, her
                    residence had been attacked by a group of bandits really, who had shot her
                    guard. She had an indoor guard and an outdoor guard. They had shot her guard and
                    were storming her house. The indoor guard had locked the entrances, storming the
                    house with submachine guns. She lived in a good area of town; there were
                    neighbors all around. It was not an estate here and an estate there. It was a
                    street with the houses fronting the street. She had an old mansion in the old
                    style. The various neighbors threw open their windows and started firing at the
                    guerrillas. The terrorists just jumped in their car and ran away. They were
                    obviously trying to kidnap her or something and hold her for ransom. So that
                    happened. I had three policemen who were assigned to me as full time plain
                    clothes bodyguards. I had a partially armored car which later became a fully
                    armored car toward the end of my tour there. I had a partially armored follow
                    car. My driver was a hired chauffeur. I had one policeman sit in there. I think
                    he was armed with an Uzi in the front seat of my car.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Uzi is a small machine gun.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Then behind me the driver of my follow car was just armed with a pistol
                    who was a police sergeant. All plain clothes. We supplied them with plain
                    clothes once a year and gave them lunch money. That was basically all we had to
                    do for them. They were happy to serve because they had their military or police
                    salary as well. Beside him in the follow car was another policeman with a sawed
                    off shotgun. That was my security and they did a very good job. I felt unlike my
                    predecessor and I agree with my predecessor, I was always a risk taker. I felt
                    that nothing much was going to happen so to set the arms policy I issued myself
                    a .45, some sort of pistol that I would carry in a plastic bag with me. At the
                    end of the day unless I was going to some preannounced function, I would dismiss
                    them, and I would drive myself. Just like most other officers, they carry a
                    pistol in some form. So, there was a little bit of terrorism. After I left, a
                    man named Nahim Zahias was elected to the dean of the consular corps. He was a
                    wealthy banker, one of the wealthiest people in Ecuador. He was the head of a
                    bank and was on the board of another bank, of Lebanese origin. He contributed to
                    all of the political parties. He was not a politician. He wanted to make sure
                    that whoever was elected, he would have some influence. He lived in a building
                    that he owned downtown. The top two floors were his suite. He was unmarried. He
                    lived with his mother and sister up there. A month or so after I left the
                    country, the same type of bandits attacked his building. They shot the guard
                    downstairs; they were coming up the elevator. He ran down the stairs, and the
                    elevator had of course a locked entrance, but he was not sure that would hold.
                    He ran downstairs, raced to the airport, arranged for a charter, and took the
                    next plane to Miami. After a month or so he came back. Then he was in
                    judiciously driving to a reception with only one armed bodyguard in the car, and
                    some Colombian guerrillas intercepted his car. This was in Guayaquil. They shot
                    his guard. They may have killed his guard; I'm not sure, with him in his car.
                    They took him hostage. A mutual acquaintance who lived down the street from him
                    named Leon Cordero was President of Ecuador at the time. Leon was a real tough
                    nut. I enjoyed talking with Leon although we didn't always agree on things. I
                    would frequently fly to Quito with him on some of our trips. We would run into
                    each other frequently up there. Anyway he was President at this time. They
                    located where the eleven kidnappers were holding Nahim. He said he was not going
                    to give in to guerrillas. He liked the U.S. policy of not paying ransom and that
                    sort of thing. He told the police to go in and if possible save Nahim but make
                    sure that the guerrillas surrendered or that none of them got out of there
                    alive. Nine of them were killed. Unfortunately Nahim was also killed. He was as
                    I say my successor to dean of the consular corps so it was a little bit of a
                    problem. Also about once a week, the students would come by on their way from
                    the university to downtown to demonstrate at the mayor's office or the
                    governor's office. They were always armed with rocks and about once a month they
                    were armed with Molotov cocktails. No matter what they had, just for good times
                    sake they would throw a few rocks at our consulate which was right on the
                    street. If they had Molotov cocktails, they would throw a few of them. We would
                    always have the visa line break off and tell them to go away. One time the visa
                    line refused to break off; they didn't want to give up their place in the line.
                    We would close the gates to the consulate and three or four people still
                    standing out there and the Molotov cocktail burned a few. We had security
                    screens on our windows on the first floor and the following floor. Heavy steel
                    stuff line that. The bottles of the Molotov cocktails would boom just blow off
                    and the rocks would stop. I asked for authority to screen the third floor. They
                    said that was not needed because the rocks and so on would not reach as high as
                    the third floor. We had inspectors there when they came by. Unfortunately this
                    was not one of the times they were throwing Molotov cocktails; they were just
                    throwing rocks. They broke three windows of the DEA office on the third floor.
                    The inspectors went in and supported our request for screens on the windows. So
                    we got that. So we did have some security problems. In fact when I first got
                    there, backing up, When I was assigned there Ray said they were authorizing
                    assigning Marine security guards because of the security problem. I said,
                    “Please Ray, can you wait until I get there and can evaluate the security
                    problem.” I know from Guyana and other places that Marine security guards
                    generally bring you more problems for a small post like that. I got there. I
                    found we had a 14 guard contract force guarding the consulate general. They were
                    not armed. We had Marine guards up at Quito of course. I said, “Look we've got
                    to arm these people, and if we can't arm them, then I want to fire them because
                    they aren't any good to us unarmed. I don't think we are going to need Marines
                    if they are armed.” There was some controversy, but Ray as usual was very
                    supportive and he said, “Okay, if you want to do it, fine.” So we got the chief
                    local of the security people to come down. We had a DEA agent who had been a DEA
                    weapons instructor before he came there, so he knew weapons backwards and
                    forwards. I got permission from the head of the Army there in Guayaquil to
                    volunteer that they could use his firing range anytime they weren't using it. I
                    had them go out there, and they took training. They got their weapons, never any
                    problem and morale went up about 200%. They didn't shoot each other in the foot
                    or shoot visitors as people were afraid they would. We certainly did not need
                    Marine security guards after that. They gave us good protection. They never
                    tried to shoot the students. They were under instruction when the students came
                    down, we will close, batten down the hatches and let them do their thing. I
                    never felt there was any problem. Occasionally we were on the radio, and
                    occasionally when I was going in from my residence the students would be
                    blockading the street. One of my colleagues in the consular corps had one of
                    them thrust a pistol to his head and get out of the car and give us some money,
                    otherwise we are going to shoot you. He did. They always avoided it and used
                    back alleys and everything to get there. I never had any problem. I never felt
                    threatened for a non previously announced formal thing I had to keep my guards.
                    As I would say, I would drive myself. I would take along a little weapon and if
                    I feel it was necessary, I would use it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Guayaquil in 1982. Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Chile and that is an interesting story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said there are a couple of more things you wanted to
                        saabout Ecuador before we move on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yes, these are illustrative of certainly the unusual aspects of a
                    consul general at Guayaquil at the time I was there, and also illustrative of
                    the odd things that occur on your tour of duty.</p>
                <p>While I was there in Ecuador, President Rodos, the person I mentioned earlier was
                    killed along with his wife in a plane crash. The state funeral they determined
                    would be held at Guayaquil. It is traditional also in Ecuador if a person from
                    Guayaquil dies while in office, I think that only happened once or twice, the
                    state funeral was held there. I researched the records and found that two people
                    made a funeral oration from the tomb when there was a state funeral in
                    Guayaquil. The President of the Chamber of Deputies, this is when a President
                    dies, and oddly enough the dean of the consular corps. I happened to be dean of
                    the consular corps at the time. There were a variety, several heads of state
                    came to the funeral. We did not send anyone from outside the country and our
                    Ambassador, Ray Gonzales came down to represent the United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>The Ecuadorian man in the street felt that was the case with a number of Latin
                    American countries, some chief of state would come to the funeral. so as Ray and
                    I drove down the street, he in a place of honor of course, and me in a
                    subsidiary position in the back seat of I believe it was my limousine. The flag
                    was flying from the stations of course; there were people lining the streets,
                    hundreds and probably thousands of people saying as the sight of the car with
                    the flag flying, “Reagan, Reagan.” I suppose they would be disappointed if they
                    could see in the car. Obviously neither one of us looked like Reagan. We
                    attended the funeral and then Ray went on to my home along with a couple of
                    other people and my wife while I retired to the cemetery. The cemetery in
                    Guayaquil is one of the few tourist attractions. The city at the time was maybe
                    about one and a quarter million people maybe pushing one and a half million, the
                    largest city in Ecuador. The cemetery has skyscraper tombs. The ground is near
                    the water level there. The tombs by and large were not in the ground, but in
                    buildings of like about eight stories but not stories like we have because you
                    are obviously talking about casket stories, the equivalent of about a four or
                    five story building. On one of the upper stories was where Rodos was going to be
                    buried along with his wife, the daughter of Assad Bucharan. The president of the
                    Chamber, the same one that introduced me at the election eve party that I
                    mentioned was there and he and I were both prepared to make our talks. I
                    prepared an appropriate funeral oration, reasonably brief. I didn't want to
                    exceed eight minutes or so in collaboration with my very well qualified
                    secretary and had the deputy Dean of the consular corps, a very wealthy banker
                    look it over. We all agreed that it was a fine funeral oration. The cortege
                    finally reached the cemetery and the man who later became President of Ecuador
                    quite recently Abdelar Bucharan. He was the brother of Mrs. Rodos. He was
                    weeping and shouting and throwing himself on the casket which continued up the
                    narrow steps to the top floor of the tomb. There Abdelar Bucharan then mayor of
                    Guayaquil and later President of Ecuador until just recently when he was voted
                    out of office by the Chamber of Deputies and I think now is in exile for
                    malfeasance. He made a real spectacle of himself allegedly attempting to throw
                    himself off the fifth floor and commit suicide, shouting, other people started
                    doing the same thing up there. I looked down toward the ground and the Director
                    of Fisheries, the man I had the problem with out in the Galapagos Islands
                    Marcello Dombrado a former chauffeur was perched up in one of the trees down
                    below the building. He was making motions to Pancho the head of the Chamber of
                    Deputies saying in effect, come down. His motions clearly, you couldn't hear
                    anything over the din of the crowd.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>I would guess there were half a million people around the cemetery and an
                    audience of several million people on television. The television cameras had
                    already been pre set some on top of the tomb, some away from the tomb filming
                    everything. He was motioning to come down. When we gave him the high sign he was
                    motioning that the tomb was clearly going to fall down and we'd all be killed in
                    the rubble of this five or eight story tomb. Finally Abdelar was making such a
                    huge ruckus that Pancho and I conferred with the head of the television team
                    there, there was just no possible way we could have anything here and save what
                    modicum of decorum that remained which was very little. Just simply end the
                    coverage and say this is all. I have addressed a television audience on several
                    things but never an audience of several million people. So, that was a
                    frustrating experience. The second little anecdote that I thought it might be
                    interesting to relate. Given an illustration of this the relatively free
                    wheeling of Ecuador and particularly Guayaquil because they were almost two
                    separate countries as far as the mores went.</p>
                <p>An overwhelmingly Catholic country, the Archbishop of Guayaquil who is now a
                    member of the College of Cardinals at his previous post at Quincha had a
                    tradition of an ecumenical thanksgiving service. This did not correspond to our
                    thanksgiving. It was a different day of the year. His tradition was to have the
                    head of the mainline Protestant churches, in this case it was a Methodist. The
                    head of the Evangelical churches, the Assembly of God or something like that,
                    the head of the Jewish community, a Muslim, and of course another Catholic
                    priest and himself and one non cleric address an assemblage which filled the
                    cathedral and filled the square outside the cathedral as it traditionally did on
                    this one day of the year. The non cleric happened to be the Dean of the Consular
                    Corps and once again I happened to be in that position. Traditionally the non
                    cleric did a prayer. I had known the Archbishop for some time. He came to my
                    farewell reception; we were fairly good friends. He knew that I was not a
                    particularly religious person. I'm not sure he knew any of the details of my
                    religious beliefs, but I told him, “Look, I really don't think I am the proper
                    person to do this despite my hemming and saying I really missed making the other
                    talk.” I said, “You know, or maybe you don't now, I am agnostic. I don't think
                    it would be appropriate for me. On the other hand, the Deputy Dean is a good
                    practicing Catholic and I am sure he would be happy to do it.” He said, “We can
                    work something in for you. What do you think you could do?” “A prayer would
                    certainly be inappropriate. I would be more than happy to do a biblical reading
                    provided you allowed me to check the text and I won't be saying anything that
                    would be against my principles.” He said, “I think I can develop something of
                    that nature.” He was a very astute man and the text was a text that I had no
                    problem with. I stood up before the assembled multitude and the flock outside.
                    It was also on television but not as big an audience as for the funeral
                    arrangements and went ahead with my little reading and the service went quite
                    well.</p>

                        Chile,from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I was in Chile from June of 1982 to August of 1985, little over three
                    years.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in Chile?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I was Deputy Chief of Mission. For the first couple of months I was
                    there I was charg� d'affaires because we were between Ambassadors and I turned
                    the post over to another charg� d'affaires when I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: That is an interesting story in itself. I received a list of vacancies
                    at my appropriate grade. At the time I had been promoted sometime when I was on
                    the Central American desk job, a fairly rapid promotion after a very slow
                    promotion from 0-4 to 0-3. It was from 0-3 to 0-2 which is councillor of embassy
                    rank at the present time. I think the position became that rank about a year or
                    so later when they made the switch. Among the post that were opening that summer
                    in which I thought I would have some interest was Deputy Chief of Mission in
                    Santiago, Chile. At that time, I had no idea. I knew the current ambassador,
                    George Landau who at that time was leaving, and at that time, I didn't know who
                    was going to take his place. I don't think the decision had been made at that
                    time who was taking his place. I put that on my list of a very small number,
                    about three posts that I was interested in. Shortly after I mailed that in, I
                    got a call from Charles Graver, Chuck Graver who I had replaced many years
                    before many years ago in my first assignment in the National Education Exchange
                    Service. He said, “I know the consul general at Guayaquil is open. Tell me about
                    it; I am considering applying for it.” I told him about it and said, “Chuck,
                    oddly enough I am considering applying for Deputy Chief of Mission in Santiago,
                    tell me about it.” And he did. He still did not know at the time who was going
                    to replace George Landau. Shortly thereafter I heard that James Steeburg, a
                    political appointee who had served as Ambassador to Nicaragua up until just
                    about the time I took over the Central America desk. He left really a week or
                    two after I took it over in '77, was going to be Ambassador. I had met him and
                    talked with him, of course, when he returned to the United States. I had just to
                    keep each other informed, he was the Republican national committee man concerned
                    with foreign affairs in the Carter administration when the Republicans of
                    course, were in the opposition. We found it useful to keep each other somewhat
                    informed about what was going on in our respective areas of expertise and he was
                    quite interested in Nicaragua having just completed two years as Ambassador
                    there. I found out he was going; I did nothing further at that time. I got a
                    call from him a week or two after I found that out. He said, “Wade, would you be
                    interested in going to Chile as my Deputy Chief of Mission?” I said, “Well, Jim,
                    oddly enough, that is one of the three posts I put on my reference sheet. Bottom
                    line, I suggest if you are interested in having me, tactically it would be a bad
                    idea to say so at this time. Yes I'd like to go. I'd be interested in going, but
                    tactically why don't you wait until you find out if I am among the choices that
                    they give you because logically I should be, but there are a lot of people
                    applying for this. If I am, you can say “gee” you're elected. I'll accept this
                    character, Matthews. You guys owe me one instead of asking for me and they say,
                    okay, you owe us one.” He said, “Good tactic,” and I understand he did that.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I went to Chile as Deputy Chief of Mission. Chuck Graver came to replace
                    me as consul general at Guayaquil. We changed jobs where we didn't have anything
                    to do with direct negotiations for changing jobs. It was through the system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, let's talk about the situation in 1982 in Chile.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: In 1982 in Chile, we had the Allende years terminating with his
                    overthrow n 1973, about nine years prior to that time following which with the
                    military government there were some serious human rights violations and almost a
                    civil war in Chile, but it was put down by the military in Chile, in some cases
                    rather brutally. Not a massive number of people killed. As well as we could
                    determine, in the immediate military takeover and shortly thereafter and over
                    the years there were very few, a total of about 700 people lost their lives in
                    Chile. Mostly through elimination by the military or through guerrilla attacks
                    and warfare. In some cases it was provoked by the individuals; in other cases
                    they were simply eliminated because they were simply too dangerous or the
                    interrogation was more harsh than it should have been and they lost their lives
                    in that way. Not a huge number, but nonetheless there had been some problems.
                    After that there were a couple of years of sort of bumbling around. Pinochet,
                    though he had not been known as a non-statist, seemed to have a rather statist
                    viewpoint took the advice of the so called Chicago boys, people who had been
                    trained under the University of Chicago in free market ideas and improvement,
                    that sort of thing. They came to him with an idea, this is how you should
                    reconstruct Chile.</p>
                <p>Their idea was a rip roaring success but there was one major problem. They pegged
                    their exchange rate too closely to the dollar. Things got outrageously expensive
                    in Chile. Exports plummeted because of this artificially high exchange rate and
                    the economy went into a recession. There were a lot of vacant stores. The
                    unemployment had risen by the time I got there to at least 15% up to 20%. It
                    probably got as high as 25%. We are not talking about a subsistence economy
                    where 25% is ho hum. This is Chile, which is accustomed to a rather high rate of
                    employment, low unemployment, so there was a significant crisis in the
                    government when I got there. The questions were, had the free market experiment
                    failed; were the policies not going to be successful, or was this aberration
                    largely caused by an artificially high exchange rate. It turned out the latter
                    was the case. The economy remained in sort of a crisis state the first year I
                    was there. They stuck to their guns about the free market principles. They freed
                    the exchange rate or allowed it to float essentially. The peso was devalued
                    substantially and the economy by the time I left was improving rather nicely,
                    and the public dissatisfaction which was really threatening to the government at
                    one time with demonstrations against it and bombs being set off on the subways
                    and elsewhere seemed to be ameliorating. That is what we ran into when we got
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Ambassador Steenburg run his Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Steenburg got there several months before I did which was under the
                    circumstances probably good because he was the sort of a person who clearly
                    wanted to be in control. He would talk about policy as he had in our lunches
                    some time before, but he wanted to be the one who made any suggestion of policy
                    direction or policy change out of the Embassy in Santiago. He was oftentimes a
                    conservative Republican; on policy he wasn't. He was a middle of the road
                    Republican; he was a George Bush Republican, a middle of the road Republican as
                    the Republican quadrant existed at that time. He had strong ideas on policy;
                    happily and I suppose he knew this when he invited me as DCM, his ideas on
                    policy did not differ substantially from mine. His basic idea for policy toward
                    Chile was basically very similar to my policy and the policy we had suggested in
                    Central America at the time. You don't try to push the people who are in charge
                    out. You try to make the people in power think as you do and think it is their
                    best interests to make the same changes as you do. He was fairly free market. He
                    was against state control, but so was the government of Chile. He was for a
                    return to democracy as soon as prudent. He felt we could do this, and I felt we
                    could do this as well through cooperating and gently nudging the government
                    rather than confronting the government.</p>
                <p>On the other hand there were rewards for moving in that direction and there were
                    sanctions for clearly not moving in that direction. Both our tasks would have
                    been fairly easy at this point. After all, we had a Republican administration in
                    Washington. Steenburg had very good contacts with Bill Casey at the CIA. He had
                    some other good relations with others in the Republican administration. The main
                    problem was Nicaragua. Nicaragua we all know, I don't want to get into that,
                    what was happening with the Reagan administration and the contras in Nicaragua.
                    Eliott Abrams was the Assistant Secretary for inter American Affairs. Eliott and
                    other people in the administration in Washington at the time felt that you have
                    got to give the Democrats and you have got to give the left and the intellectual
                    circles and so on, you have got to give them a bone that you throw to them if
                    you are going to keep them from attacking the more vulnerable news of the
                    contras and what they were doing in Central America.</p>
                <p>Now, in contrast to the view of the Carter administration when it came in,
                    Central America was the dog wagging the Latin American tail and not the reverse.
                    In order to stave off criticism from the left on our rather pro right policy, if
                    you will, in Nicaragua, Chile was not that important to us and therefore you
                    could dump on Chile a little even when logically you shouldn't have. If there
                    was some reason to dump on Chile, you could do so to protect your flank in
                    Central America. That was our major problem. Eliott Abrams felt at times we
                    weren't cooperative. We were recommending against an anti-Chilean statement or
                    vote or something of that nature. We felt that Chile was moving, though slowly
                    in the right direction, and if you upset the apple cart, if you did as we did in
                    Central America and backed Pinochet up too far, he might say to hell with this,
                    we can get it anywhere.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the Embassy's relations with Pinochet,
                        personally anthen with the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: My relations with Pinochet were really nonexistent. Oh, I had been to
                    some ceremonies with him. I had exchanged a couple of words with him on a couple
                    of occasions. That was roughly the extent of it you know. I sat ten seats
                    removed from him at a couple of ceremonies as well. Pinochet did not attend
                    National Day receptions. He was not a terribly sociable individual other than
                    intimate friends and relatives of his. He was a very stuffy rather starched
                    shirt. Essentially honest. Oh there was a little hanky panky going on probably,
                    but not much. He was basically honest and made his decisions on what he thought
                    was basically good for the country. A very different person from Somoza in
                    Nicaragua some years ago.</p>
                <p>My boss would accompany visiting dignitaries to call on Pinochet with the
                    exception of Dick [Gen. Vernon?] Walters. Dick Walters was the only American who
                    had a more or less first name relationship with Pinochet. He came down a couple
                    of times. When he needed somebody to go in and talk frankly to Pinochet and joke
                    with him and tell a few off color stories. Dick Walters had known Pinochet way
                    back when he was a colonel or captain or god knows something in the military,
                    long ago. He was the kind of person who spoke fluent Spanish of course, along
                    with five or six other languages. Dick Walters always insisted on making those
                    calls on his own, not with me, I wouldn't have gone anyway of course. He always
                    made these on his own and he was about the only person who could get away with
                    it without wasting a trip. The Ambassador should be in on the conversations even
                    if the Ambassador is one of the note takers, he should be there. So Dick was the
                    exception. Otherwise, Pinochet was accessible only to persons of adequate rank
                    and background. Every businessman, every human rights crusader, every
                    Congressman who came down, we had a lot of Congressmen come down, did not get in
                    to see Pinochet.</p>
                <p>Q: Other than keeping Chile from becoming the token punching bag for the left
                    wing in the political United States, and protecting it from getting too
                    involved, what were your main concerns?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Oh, we were pushing the U.S. policy to encourage an orderly transition
                    to civilian government incorporating at least all non-communist areas of the
                    body politic. Some communist areas, lets face it, were affiliated with some of
                    the existing political parties. The communist party per se was not a threat. Its
                    activities, at least while I was in Chile were not a threat. They are still not.
                    Chile, unlike some other Latin American countries had really been inoculated
                    against radical communist revolution by the Allende experience, including
                    partisans of the Allende cause. People who were 100% with him said well, we made
                    some mistakes. We moved too rapidly. We probably shouldn't have even moved in
                    that direction. We should have moved much more slowly. We think that state
                    control of the means of production is a good idea, but it would have to be a lot
                    more gradually and with much more consensus. Allende was trying to do it much
                    too quickly. These are all accepted. They literally outlawed people who were
                    throwing the bombs around. There weren't too many then. That was the political
                    scene. Now what do you do?</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>We encouraged the government through every extent we could, through all our
                    programs to continue moving toward democracy. There were some moves toward
                    democracy but they were rehearsing it while we were there. The opposition was
                    tolerated. There were three opposition weeklies published. Two most of the time
                    I was there, no opposition daily newspapers. They would attack Pinochet roundly,
                    they would attack the government roundly. They were not terribly influential;
                    the circulation was not too large, but their editors were not picked up and
                    thrown in jail, and they were allowed to publish. The daily press was sort of
                    pro Pinochet but also pushing the same line we were. We had good relations with
                    them; they were pushing for the same sort of things we were.</p>
                <p>Many of the cabinet members were also pushing for the same sort of things we
                    were. Some of the cabinet members, some of the military were dubious that Chile
                    could make any sort of a rapid transition. They were talking about 15 years to
                    transit to democracy maybe. Of course, we felt that we could go much more
                    rapidly than that, and in fact it did so. We had very good contact with and
                    private lunches with the leading opposition people including the two men, the
                    first immediate post Pinochet president and the current President of Chile. They
                    would attend our receptions and were invited to our parties. I sat in on one
                    very informal session of a Christian Democratic basic sort of a policy section.
                    The Christian Democrats operated legally if informally. They were not really
                    recognized as a party. Political parties were not formally recognized. They
                    operated every way shape and form like a political party except they couldn't
                    expand themselves because there were no elections. They couldn't have a legal
                    status as a political party at the time. They were referred to as the Christian
                    Democratic party and Gabriello Valdez was the chairman of the Christian
                    Democratic Party.</p>
                <p>Patricio Allende, who was the first President of Chile after Pinochet, was the
                    lawyer for the Christian Democratic Party. If I had to make my choice as to who
                    I would like to see as President of Chile as soon as Pinochet allowed this to
                    happen or if something happened to Pinochet, I would have picked Patricio
                    Allende as my favorite. I didn't think he could be president, He was not enough
                    a rabble rouser, he was not quite far enough to the left. His relations were
                    relatively good with the military. Therefore I thought the Christian Democrats
                    would not support him. Also he was a little bit older than some of his
                    equivalents in the directorate of the Christian Democratic party. We all
                    believed that the Christian Democrats depending on what sort of trunk, what
                    direction things took after Pinochet, were one of the two most likely successor
                    parties to represent them. One direction would be if a more pro military
                    government, a group that had cooperated with the military they would have good
                    political potential free market types. We thought that was at least a 50%
                    chance.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>Basically to summarize, our tack was twofold as far as our major purpose in
                    Chile, one, encouraging the government to move toward democracy, and two,
                    encourage the democratic opposition to collaborate sufficiently with the
                    government in this transition so the military government would not feel they
                    were going to be kicked out on their posteriors with charges brought against
                    them, therefore they would hang on for dear life to the bitter end. To be
                    honest, I think we were successful in both those endeavors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other embassies in Chile at that time who
                        werplaying somewhat the same role or had the same prestige or clout?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Same prestige or clout, absolutely not. Same role, yes, the British
                    played a very similar role. A number of the ambassadors informally and without
                    the concurrence of their governments played a similar role in their contacts,
                    some of the European powers basically. Most of the Latin American powers were
                    playing the same sort of role. The Brazilian Ambassador...</p>
                <p>Let me explain something. I got to know, though Freburgh was very different from
                    my first ambassador, Max Krebs in Guyana, he was quite jealous of his
                    prerogatives. He did not want a DCM going and doing the sort of things he
                    thought Ambassadors should do, which essentially meant contact except when I was
                    Charg� on a number of occasions. Contact with the Foreign Minister. Contact with
                    most of the other ministers. Contacts with members of the Junta although I did
                    have lots of contacts with at least three members of the Junta. It was a four
                    man Junta, so at least three but not with Pinochet. That is it. Pinochet was a
                    little aside. Very circumscribed contacts with certain individuals that he felt
                    to be his contacts. Now this was good and bad. It was good in that you didn't
                    spin your wheels and confuse the people as to who were the contacts. It was
                    clear that the ambassador was the contact, and he represented the U.S.
                    government. I was the channel only when the ambassador was out of the country or
                    when the Ambassador so instructed me. That was no problem, nothing wrong with
                    that at all. It was bad in that, it was frustrating to me in come cases because
                    I had to constantly say now am I going too far or not far enough, and I could
                    have just been a cycle and managed the Embassy.</p>
                <p>We had a very qualified administrator who was taking over managing the general
                    works of the Embassy, and the ambassador particularly wanted to coordinate the
                    activities of the Agency [CIA] and the defense attaches and the commercial
                    attaches. We had two deputy commercial attaches. He didn't care much about the
                    Department of Agriculture and the DEA people, this, that, and the other. He
                    said, “You handle those guys,” but the others he particularly wanted to. So I
                    had to make sure that I didn't overstep my bounds in dealing with those
                    people.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>Traditionally the American ambassador had been a member of a very informal
                    organization that embraced a lot of people of different political persuasions.
                    Though not radical, it tended to be on the conservative side, it had some
                    opposition members of the Christian Democrats in the club called the Club de
                    Fieros or Club of Fires. They would meet Friday for lunch, and the lunch would
                    be a long drawn out affair with a cake and this, that or the other around a huge
                    round table. There were usually about 25 people in attendance. We would debate
                    anything that struck us. Anybody could bring up a theme, it was very informal.
                    The discussion would be hot and heavy, argumentative and so on, always in
                    Spanish of course. It contained people, for example, I think the number two in
                    the Air Force at the time of the military takeover, a couple of former senators
                    from the Allende regime, a former Congressman, a couple of business people but
                    politically attuned, and about five or six Ambassadors. I was the only non
                    ambassador foreigner who was there. I was invited to join because Jim Stenburg
                    felt this would be a little beneath his dignity. The American Ambassador should
                    not be as approachable and participate in that sort of thing to the extent that
                    I and the other Ambassadors were willing to do. That he should hold off a little
                    because after all he was a special Ambassador, the most influential Ambassador
                    around. So, he didn't want to be a member. Since he didn't want to, they turned
                    to me and said, “Would you like to be a member?” I didn't always do for things
                    of that nature, but since he clearly had turned them down. He had no objections
                    to my being a member. I would tell him little tidbits I would get. Anyway that
                    was a good channel of communication to a lot of these people, because these
                    people, there was one of the most influential newspaper columnists for example
                    in Chile, tended the opposition there. The British ambassador was a member, the
                    Argentine ambassador, the Peruvian ambassador, those are the countries you need
                    to be around. The Brazilian ambassador, other Europeans, the Spanish ambassador.
                    That was about it I guess, and myself. There were people from a variety of
                    political persuasions. One of the directors of the Christian Democrat party,
                    Pacheco was his name, one of the most influential persons behind the scenes I
                    would say in the Christian Democratic party at the time. There was a socialist,
                    but you know, a moderate socialist. We discussed a lot of things and I found
                    that a very useful entry into a lot of other things, freewheeling discussions. I
                    tried to attend whenever I could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, from '82 to '85 did you see any discernible change
                        in thPinochet government, in its direction of what it was going to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yes, Pinochet's attitude, the economic crisis and the ensuing political
                    developments, the rise in bombings, that sort of thing, his natural inclination
                    which he indulged in you understand was batten down the hatches and not make any
                    movement toward democratization because that would be interpreted as a sign of
                    weakness. So it was difficult for movement to take place, but there were other
                    countervening forces on him and as the economy got better we began to see some
                    movement in that direction in the latter part of the time I was there, the last
                    let's say year I was there as the economy was improving. It was clearly
                    underway, and we felt it could be helped along by encouraging more progress in
                    the direction that was being taken and saying fine progress; let's keep it up
                    and if anything increase it. There were elements in the U.S. government as I say
                    that would harp on other items to the exclusion of that. As it turned out, he
                    did continue, and Pinochet didn't need to be pushed that much harder. He felt
                    that his long term survival and his legacy that he wanted to leave Chile was in
                    that direction.</p>
                <p>Now Pinochet is not going to be remembered as the George Washington of Chile by
                    any means. Bernardo O'Higgins has that role already. Pinochet is looked at by
                    many as the person who interrupted Chilean democracy and the person responsible
                    ultimately for those roughly 700 or so deaths which are badly exaggerated.
                    People talk about thousands of deaths. We checked into it as well as we possibly
                    could and as I say, the number of deaths in the aftermath of the revolution and
                    the course of the revolution was in the hundreds not the thousands. It doesn't
                    excuse them all; I am certain there were many violations, but you have got to
                    put it in the proper context. Could Chile's transformation have occurred with
                    out the sort of military takeover? I don't think so. I really don't believe it
                    could at the time it did. Chile was the leader of Latin America in this sort of
                    thing.</p>
                <p>Illustration, I was in Belarus for the department on business looking over the
                    management of Embassies in 1992. While I was there I had occasion to have a
                    brief conversation through an interpreter with the president of Belarus, not the
                    current president, but the president back then. The conversation was on some
                    moves toward privatizing social security and things like that. I said, “You
                    ought to look at what the Chileans have done, not only on that but on a number
                    of other things. They have anticipated the sort of thing you are thinking about
                    doing some time ago. You really ought to send a delegation to Chile.” He said,
                    “We did. Chile is an interesting model that we are considering. Our delegation
                    has been there,” and I think he said a Chilean delegation has been to Belarus
                    for that very sort of thing. He said, “It is quite interesting and we are
                    considering that sort of thing.” That is way over in Belarus.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>Now in Latin America, other countries kept looking at what Chile was doing. They
                    looked at the privatization. They looked at once the economy got back on the
                    road, it happened in the last year I was there, much more so as the effect of it
                    took place several years later, this became increasingly obvious all around
                    Latin America, and I think Chile was a major motivation for what happened all
                    around Latin America in ensuing years. Chile led the way. It led the way because
                    the Chicago boys were given by Pinochet sort of free reign. They did more or
                    less what they wanted to in the economic area and the area of government
                    services, that sort of thing. It worked. Could it have happened if Allende had
                    let's say if democracy had survived an Allende term which I think is very
                    dubious and had the Christian Democrats returned, whatever party returned. I
                    don't believe so because there was a lot of blood on the floor. I'm speaking
                    figuratively here. Not literally. I'm not talking about those 700 people roughly
                    who died in the revolution and its aftermath. I'm talking about people who lost
                    their life savings, people who lost their secondary job for which they were
                    being paid by somebody else who did their job because they had the union
                    contract to do it. So the person doing the job actually got half the salary and
                    the other half went to a person who just stayed home and collected it and maybe
                    had another job on the side, all sorts of abuses like that. Could that have
                    happened under a democratic government? Probably not. The people wouldn't sit
                    still for it. Sometimes, though I am not an advocate of military coups and
                    military takeovers, I am not at all sure in Chile, it would have worked without
                    one.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you have a problem with Americans visiting Chile who were supporters of
                    Allende from or still smarting under what was considered Nixon's overthrow of
                    Chile who wanted to come, either Congressmen or public figures and all who sort
                    of wanted to raise holy hell and that?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Oh, minor problems. It was not a big problem. We had a number of
                    Congressmen who came down, CODELs. I shepherded some around; other people
                    shepherded some around. Control officers were assigned, too. Some were very
                    helpful to us. Some were counterproductive. The type that I had very little
                    respect for were those who came who said sort of mealy mouthed right things
                    while they were there, didn't really do their homework, didn't check into things
                    thoroughly, said basically unobjectionable things while they were there, went
                    back home and blasted Chile in the process. They wouldn't attack us, well they
                    would attack the U.S. government for not being forceful enough at pushing
                    Pinochet out, and why can't we get rid of this guy and why can't we have nirvana
                    tomorrow.</p>
                <p>Some were extremely helpful. Bill Richardson was one who was extremely helpful. I
                    went down and either I was his control officer or I was Charg� at the time, I
                    don't remember which. Richardson spoke Spanish fluently. He came down there. We
                    read his briefing paper thoroughly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is now the present ambassador to the United
                        Nations.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: That's right. He was very helpful. The Congressman from Massachusetts
                    who just resigned for health reasons. He was very liberal, very helpful to us.
                    Tribble from Virginia, very helpful. He listened to us. He came and talked with
                    us first. This is what we are trying to do. We believe you can be of great
                    assistance to us if you will do A, B, and C. We did emphasize it with the
                    government and the opposition along the lines I was mentioning earlier, and they
                    helped us.</p>
                <p>By and large, contrary to what I understand is oftentimes the case and contrary
                    to my experience, most of the CODELS we had either were helpful or a watch. A
                    few were quite negative and caused us problems. They were not insurmountable
                    problems or big problems.</p>
                <p>Other people, sure human rights delegations were a dime a dozen in Chile. Some
                    would call on us; some wouldn't. Some we would run into in places where they
                    didn't call on us, some wouldn't. Some wanted to talk with us, some didn't. They
                    were if I had to put it on balance slightly unfavoring, not entirely. Some
                    though they disagreed with policy and felt, they almost always take the short
                    term view, unfortunately, the human rights types, and we tend to stand in the
                    way. The world is black and white to put it into standard terms. I am not
                    implying any racism here. Unless you put it in the white column, you get your
                    signals mixed up. You don't discourage practices you should discourage in time.
                    The other side is going to do a much better job. I don't want to put it in black
                    and white terms. Some human rights groups that came down, delegations or
                    individuals were somewhat helpful, others weren't. No more than 50 on a zero to

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the media coverage from the United States during
                        youperiod/</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Media tended to focus on the sensational. Sometimes they would give a
                    good background article on knowing what was happening, but it depended largely
                    on the credentials of the correspondent. If you got a johnny come lately, a
                    person who didn't really know much about Latin America, he would come in and do
                    the superficiality. It was largely who got to him first with the most persuasion
                    who got the articles. Or he had his preconceptions. It was mixed. We got some
                    good media coverage, astute media coverage. Some people we talked to knew the
                    story so well they didn't need to talk to us. They knew what we represented and
                    wanted to form their own opinions, and sometimes they came out with some very
                    good articles. Sometimes they didn't.</p>

                        younkids coming down to change the world.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Not particularly. Chile was a place where people who wanted to change
                    the world didn't stand out. A Chilean looks pretty much like an American by and
                    large. There are different faces, some are lighter; some are darker. Blacks,
                    Negroes, are few and far between in Chile. In fact there aren't any native to
                    Chile unless they are first generation or second generation, very few, so they
                    would stand out, but we had hardly any of them. None that I can recall at the
                    moment except for a few vacationing Peace Corps volunteers. I think we did get
                    Peace Corps volunteers in, the latter part of the time I was there. Otherwise a
                    Chilean looks pretty much like an American so an American doesn't stand out.
                    There may have been some problems.</p>
                <p>There weren't any that I remember who got in bed with the Guerrillas or made
                    contact. The guerrillas laid pretty low while I was there. Interestingly enough
                    there was dialog of a sort in Chile during the Pinochet regime between radical
                    elements and not. There was a scandal on the latter part of the time I was there
                    regarding some opposition radicals who probably had been planting some bombs
                    almost certainly and who were found with their throats slit. It turned out that
                    a Carbanero group which is the national police group was apparently responsible
                    for this. We are talking about three or four people. I recall one conversation
                    that I found fascinating at a reception between a woman who had been a minister
                    or deputy minister under Allende. Her son was one of these people with their
                    throats slit. She upbraided the then head of the Carbaneros, who later had to
                    resign about the fact that the Carbaneros had apparently killed these people. He
                    kept saying, no, they hadn't and “the matter is under investigation and so on.”
                    It was a rather civil conversation, and this was an open political discussion.
                    She had no repercussion on her. She obviously sympathized completely with her
                    son. We are talking here about covert violent activity that had taken place.</p>
                <p>Q: What about trade with the United States? What was the Embassy role? Any
                    particular problems? I'm thinking of course when I interviewed Tony Gillespie,
                    and he arrived just as there was a grape episode. How about during the time you
                    were there? Let's talk about trade for a moment.</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yes, the grape episode I will comment on later. It didn't take place
                    while I was there. Trade was very mutually beneficial when I was there. We had
                    large exports of mining equipment. Chile had large exports of both copper, other
                    minerals and fruit and salmon, Henry's salmon something cured down in the
                    southern part of the country. Chile was developing its export industry very
                    well. Mostly U.S. winter fruit. As far as percentage increase, it wasn't nearly
                    as important as copper to the United States. Mutually beneficial trade was
                    growing, growing rather rapidly. Investment was substantial. Investment in the
                    mining field primarily, but it was beginning in the vineyards and that sort of
                    thing as well. We had an agricultural attach�. Part of the time he had a deputy.
                    We had a commercial attach� and deputy commercial attach�. They were pushing
                    U.S. exports to Chile. The Chileans were pushing exports to the United
                    States.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>The only problem in the trade area that I recall happened long after I was there
                    aside from the grape incident which did not take place while I was there. There
                    was publicity which the opposition press ran with photos an so on that the
                    government was sending a Boeing 747 around once a month to load up on cluster
                    bombs that were being produced by Cardling Industries. Carlos Cardling was a
                    wealthy mining engineer who began to make his fortune in mining explosives and
                    then he branched out into armaments and equipment of various sorts including
                    vehicles and then real estate development. He was shipping cluster bombs to
                    Iraq. We reported that, after all we were not experts on Iraqi-Iranian
                    affairThis was during the Iraq-Iran war. The Department looked at it and said,
                    “Ho-hum.” It turned out without our knowing it that zirconium was being exported
                    from the United States for putting in these cluster bombs with these export
                    papers saying this zirconium was going for mining explosives. Anybody who knew
                    zirconium, I have never heard of zirconium while I was in Chile, I never saw
                    these reports. Had I seen them, I wouldn't know what to make of them. Anyway the
                    Embassy was reporting that Iraqi planes were coming once a month and loading up
                    on cluster bombs made by Cardling Industries. The only negative vibe we got back
                    from the Department was there was a rumor which we picked up about the same time
                    as the Department picked it up and we reported it, that Cardling was going to
                    start playing both ends against the middle. He was going to start to export
                    cluster bombs to Iran. We were instructed to go over and tell Carlos in no
                    uncertain terms that we would not look on that favorably if in fact that were to
                    take place or was taking place. I believe one of the military attaches went over
                    to deliver that message. Carlos said, “What do you think I am, a complete
                    idiot?” He said,” A. I would be getting myself on somebody's assassination list
                    if I were to do so rather quickly, B. I am perfectly aware that you Americans
                    would not take kindly to that.” After all the Iranians were really pressing the
                    Iraqis at the time. It looked like Iran might take over Iraq. He had no
                    intention of selling cluster bombs to the Iranians. Some years later after
                    Saddam Hussein had attacked in the Middle East, this became a cause c�l�bre and
                    with typical short term viewpoint, a federal prosecutor in Miami brought charges
                    against Carlos and Teledyne industries for illegally using U.S. zirconium in
                    these cluster bombs. I think Carlos was convicted in absentia and fined a couple
                    of million dollars which meant most of his U.S. assets but didn't touch most of
                    his Chilean assets. Teledyne agreed to pay a fine of a couple of million
                    dollars, and some guy named Johnson who was sitting out in jail who was the
                    salesman who is sitting out in jail in Phoenix, Arizona, the last I heard. There
                    was a CBS 48 Hours program last July on this issue in which I had about a two
                    minute snippet out of a two hour interview that I allowed them to have. I simply
                    said we had reported this export to Iraq of cluster bombs and had never got any
                    comeback from the government on that from a negative viewpoint, but I knew
                    nothing about zirconium and I didn't think the Embassy did at the time. So that
                    is the sort of things on commerciaOtherwise things went beautifully.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other major developments while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: In our reporting, we had a very qualified, during most of the time I
                    was there, political counselor and a very astute economic counselor. Peter
                    Whitney was the economic counselor. My major problems were controlling relations
                    between the ambassador and them and keeping them on an even keel. He at times
                    would I thought try to inject himself a little too much into the operations of
                    the various sections. He at times could be a difficult person. At times I had
                    problems with him. There were a couple of times I seriously thought about asking
                    to be relieved. By and large, I got along well with him. I think I cooperated
                    with him as well as any person could have. In Nicaragua some years earlier, he
                    had gone through his first two DCMs and more or less got along with his third
                    one, but he was not easy for a DCM to deal with. I thought we had a respect for
                    each other's opinions. I clearly regarded him as the boss, but I would tell him
                    when I thought he was out of line. Sometimes he liked it, and sometimes he
                    didn't like it, and told me in effect to mind my own business which was his
                    prerogative. But he did tell me when I got there, he said, “Look, Wade, I'm
                    going to run this Embassy. I am going to make the policy. You are welcome to
                    tell me what you think, but once I say this is the way it is going to be, I
                    expect you to abide by it.” He said, “However as you know, I am not career of
                    course. Your first responsibility is to keep me out of jail. If you think I am
                    doing something that is going to get me in jail, I want you to tell me so, tell
                    me quickly, and I want you to tell me what you think I ought to do about it.” He
                    said, “Don't hold back.” So, I didn't. He never did anything that would get him
                    in jail, but...</p>

                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: He died unfortunately a couple of years after. I was a pall bearer at
                    his funeral. I think he was playing a vigorous tennis game down in Jamaica. This
                    was about the time I came back from the War College in '87. He died of a heart
                    attack. I think he was in his late 50s at the time, a couple of years older than
                    I am. Let's go back 15 years ago, I'm 64 now so yes about 50, and he would have
                    been in his early 50s.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Absolutely. I felt there was still a possibility that things could be
                    screwed up by U.S. actions, buI thought if things continued on their present
                    trend, a democratic government would be installed with some sort of tight
                    military oversight for a few years probably about the time that it in fact did
                    come in just a few years later. I was quite pleased at how things went. I
                    thought furthermore, Chile could teach the United States its private social
                    security system, the way I was mentioning at lunch with you, Chile encourages
                    competition among government entities, how they did driver's licenses. As long
                    as they allowed the local municipality to keep the revenue from it, you could
                    get a driver's license or license plates anywhere else. Local municipalities
                    competed to get more people to get driver's licenses or plates from them and
                    they offered beautiful service. I thought they had a lot of things they could
                    teach the United States. The economic counselor felt the same way. He reported
                    in detail, a prolific writer and he had a couple of good staff economists,
                    Chileans on his staff and he had two deputies who could also write well and he
                    wrote rather hard; they didn't always agree with him.. So all these things got
                    reported back to Washington and completely ignored. Chile could not teach the
                    United States anything whatsoever was the attitude in Washington, and stop
                    bothering to tell us that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go in '85?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: In '85 I was angling for an ambassadorial job. I felt by that time I
                    was certainly ready for it. I was a minister counselor. I was promoted shortly
                    after I arrived in Chile probably on the basis of the Guayaquil reports and
                    perhaps partly on the basis of the Central America reports. The personnel system
                    actually was ready to propose me for first one, then another. Small
                    Ambassadorial posts. A couple of them were in Africa, but I didn't have the
                    credentials for the Africa Bureau that they liked, but they were apparently
                    willing to sit still for a couple. Two of them went to political appointees. The
                    White House had not removed the hold on theThey thought that by floating this
                    name by them it might encourage the White House to remove the hold. The third
                    one went to a USIA officer. So at the last minute, these were consecutive that I
                    was being floated for, first one then another, then a third one. By the time the
                    third one came around, I was just about ready as the fellow who was to replace
                    me as charg� was arriving. This was in August I think already. I came back to
                    Washington without an assignment. I went by to see, I quite didn't relish
                    walking the halls of Washington. I could have had an office director position
                    like I had some years before, but I didn't want it. I, in fact, was offered one.
                    I said, “What else do you have outside Washington?” Marshall Brennet who was a
                    former ambassador to Iceland had just decided to retire, there is more to the
                    story than that, decided to retire rather than take the State Department advisor
                    and professor of strategy and policy at the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode
                    Island. “The post is available, would you like for us to float your name for
                    it?” I said, “What else,” and they told me and I said, “Do it.” He did and the
                    president of the War College accepted me for that, and I went up to join the
                    class and try to catch up with them for the first semester. Catch up with the
                    students, not with the professors. I was supposed to be teaching the students. I
                    guess I got there in mid September of '85.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Almost two years, two academic years. I left there in August of '87
                    after my two years at the War College which I found enjoyable. My main interest
                    in doing that aside from not being in Washington, I always toyed with the idea
                    of going and getting some sort of job, teaching, research, what have you at a
                    university. I wanted to try it out, and this was one foot in the door. It was
                    similar, not quite the same thing as a university. I did have a couple of
                    elective classes that I developed, both on Latin America which seemed to be well
                    received. I got a good, in fact, I oversubscribed both of them. The number of
                    students I wanted was 25 and I think I had 30 and 32, so I got a few more than I
                    wanted to have. I did a not terribly good job of teaching the core seminar in
                    strategy and policy. Let's face it, historians knew their material backwards and
                    forwards. My first semester I was not quite keeping up with the students. The
                    second semester I did a little better, but I was closer to a student level than
                    I was to a professorial level so had there not been the fact that we had team
                    teaching on those core seminars, I was almost completely lost. I admitted when I
                    left that it was a bad idea for the average Foreign Service officer to go to
                    have his other part of his had being professor of strategy and policy. He should
                    instead be a professor of what they call national security decision making,
                    inter government coordination and cooperation, that sort of thing, which I knew
                    something about. I didn't know a hell of a lot about the Peloponnesian War, the
                    Franco-Prussian War what have you, but I did know something about how government
                    agencies dealt with each other. After one or two people after me who didn't want
                    to give up the prestige of strategy and policy, they could contribute something
                    there, they did in fact switch over so the principal State Department
                    representative to the War College in recent years has been the national security
                    decision making or the new permutation renamed for the same thing, one of the
                    three curricula they have there.</p>
                <p>Q: I have talked to people who have been at various War Colleges in the Foreign
                    Service. They often rank the navy fairly far down as to international political
                    sophistication as opposed to the army or even the air force. How did you view
                    this with respect to your students?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Looking at my students at the War College, they gave out prizes for a
                    variety of things to various and sundry students. The army students got prizes
                    out of proportion to the number of students that they had there. I don't know
                    the percentages anymore, but just to pull a figure out of the air, let's say
                    maybe 15% of the students were army. They would receive 40% of the prizes every
                    year. That meant that they had some pretty good students they sent up there. The
                    navy I think there is a reason for that</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>Academically the Naval War College first got accreditation to give masters
                    degrees by the War College, before the Air War College or the Army War College.
                    So, the academic program there was a good academic program, considerably better
                    than the other two colleges on academic pursuits, at least by the American
                    Association of Colleges and Universities evaluation panels. As far as the
                    quality of the students, I think the Army certainly was for the average student
                    was ahead. The navy will say there is a very good reason for that. We operate
                    these ships and we have the same sort of demands on out time and our personnel,
                    just about as many in peacetime as we do in wartime. Therefore, we can't afford
                    to pull out as many of our good people for a year of training at the War College
                    like the army can or the air force does. Particularly the army because after
                    all, the army is geared up to fight wars. If they are not fighting wars, they
                    are training. The navy is geared up for operating their ships. If they are not
                    operating their ships, they are training. There is no lull, so I think that was
                    the reason. I had some highly qualified students up there. I was by and large
                    impressed with the quality of the students and their dedication to their work.
                    There were obviously exceptions, but not too many. Yes the army was better. The
                    air force I wouldn't say so necessarily. I think the reason was probably similar
                    to the navy. The air force has planes to fly. Maybe it is not as tightly
                    operated.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, these people don't have the time. An army basically is kind of sitting
                    around, I mean training is the name of the game. Well, you left there in '87.
                    Why don't we pick this up the next time in '87. Where did you go?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I went to the inspection corps as a senior inspector. I had still made
                    one last stab at trying to get an ambassadorial job, but none floated up. I
                    suppose by that time I was beginning to get to the point when I was shrugging my
                    shoulders. I was particularly interested, I think I mentioned one time before
                    the Central American thing, I tried to get an interim assignment, a six month or
                    so assignment in inspections. They said, “We'd be glad to have you, but not for
                    six months, make it a tour. It would be of value to us.”</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>This time I asked for a job in the inspection corps rather than any of the other
                    more traditional places for two reasons. One, I had a variety in my experience
                    and background so it meant that I had something to offer. Two, it was a good
                    sort of terminal assignment I did look on it although I was maybe going to make
                    one last stab at trying to get an Ambassadorial post. By that time that was kind
                    of a long shot. I thought this would be an interesting way to give them
                    something back without getting overly immersed in the problems or affairs of a
                    particular country, so it would be interesting. I said, “Dave, I'll tell you. I
                    would like to be a senior inspector, but I would like not to be assigned to
                    inspect any Latin American posts whatsoever during my time on inspection. I'd
                    certainly be there for two years, possibly another year or so. I'll go anywhere
                    in the world. I do not want to go to the pleasure domes. I'll go to Laos or
                    Africa or what have you, but not Latin America.” Two reasons. I have been in
                    every Latin American country except for the Bahamas. Therefore there was nothing
                    new to see. I knew the Latin American policy, and I also knew a lot of people in
                    the ARA Bureau and in Latin America. I preferred to inspect people that I didn't
                    know so that I didn't come on board with preconceptions. I did come on board
                    with preconceptions. I knew a lot of the people in other areas too, but not as
                    many as I knew in Latin America. Incidentally, speaking of people, the political
                    counselor whose name I had a momentary blank was Michael Durkee in Chile.</p>
                <p>Q: Wade, we've already gone into how and why you got into the inspection corps.
                    In the first place you did inspection from when to when?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: September 1987 actually up to some little time after I retired. I
                    retired in August of 1990 and inspection finished in November of 1992.</p>
                <p>Q: All right, let's talk about this. There is no point in playing games with
                    retired or not retired. We'll take the whole thing. You wanted to keep out of
                    Latin America and I assume you did. In the first place could you describe during
                    this '87-'92 period how the inspections were set up because this was relatively
                    new under the new Inspector General under the Foreign Service Act of 1988. The
                    Inspector General was separate from the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Sherman Font was the first non-Foreign Service officer who was
                    Inspector General. When I called and talked about this job when I basically
                    arranged it with the then IG, he was basically the last Foreign Service officer,
                    Bill Harrop. Sherman Font came in sometime after I had worked this out and the
                    time I arrived. I think Sherman came in July or August of '87, sometime like
                    that. I arrived as I said in September of '87. We had Sherman the non-Foreign
                    Service officer was the Inspector General. The Deputy Inspector General was a
                    Foreign Service officer.. Then under him, there was an Assistant Inspector
                    General who was in charge of inspections and another one in charge of audits. A
                    little later they established one in charge of the office of security operations
                    or investigations, things of that nature. Then there was sort of a special
                    office which also had an assistant IG, so there wee three or four assistant IGs.
                    The Assistant IG in charge of inspections was a career Foreign Service officer.
                    Most of the time I was there it was Clint Lauderdale, but when I first arrived,
                    I can't think of who it was.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>Q: I have interviewed Clint. Could you talk about how the system worked, sort of
                    the generic how an inspection worked at that time and then we'll talk about
                    specific ones.</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: The integration of the inspection corps with the new broadened office
                    of the IG worked surprisingly smoothly. Not to say there weren't conflicts, that
                    there weren't disagreements. Some of the people would gnash their teeth and say
                    one hand the professional inspectors if you will who basically had an auditing
                    background would say how in the world do these people do this sort of thing.
                    They are not thorough, they don't follow a good audit trail. On the other hand
                    the Foreign Service officers who all were experienced by definition by the time
                    they came there would shake their head and say these bloody people don't know a
                    damn thing about the Foreign Service. How do they expect to evaluate post
                    performance and bureau performance that sort of thing if in some cases they have
                    never even been overseas. There were obviously attempts to remedy both of these
                    criticisms. The only group that had an appreciable number of Foreign Service
                    officers was the inspection corps, the office of inspections under the IG. When
                    I started out, I would say that between two-thirds and three-quarters, probably
                    closer to three-quarters were Foreign Service officers and one-quarter civil
                    service personnel most of who had come over with Sherman Font from the
                    Department of Commerce.</p>
                <p>Q: The inspection service was set up and that both sides the professional
                    auditors were sort of dubious about people who didn't understand the audit trail
                    and the Foreign Service were distrustful of people who had never been overseas.
                    But was it beginning to meld by then?</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I'm not sure it was melding at that time. It did certainly meld,
                    usually satisfactorily over the course of the nest three years or so that I was
                    involved in this process, actually close to four years if you include my post
                    retirement. The team leader of almost all of the teams was a senior career
                    Foreign Service officer. I think we had five team leaders, it could have been
                    six. The official team leader was always a former Ambassador. He had that title
                    to his name. The deputy team leader to begin with was also a senior Foreign
                    Service officer almost all of whom had not served as Ambassador. I was assigned
                    most of the time as a deputy team leader. The other people, the consular
                    inspector was always a career consular officer of course. The inspection civil
                    service people, the auditors came in those who were assigned to the inspection
                    division. There was a whole separate audit division that quickly grew until it
                    was larger in terms of personnel than our inspection division. That was entirely
                    civil service auditors. Those who were in inspections handled some of the
                    administrative matters now. In other words budget and fiscal. That was a logical
                    place to put an auditor. We generally had a General Services Administration
                    person. Sometimes the auditors came from that division. Now during the time that
                    I was there, several of the deputy team leaders, civil service personnel became
                    deputy team leaders, and that was the idea behind what Sherman Font wanted to
                    do. As they gained more experience with the Foreign Service, he wanted the
                    groups to be pretty thoroughly integrated. He wanted some of the team leaders to
                    be civil service people, not former Ambassadors and he wanted some of the
                    deputies to be the same. So the integration proceeded apace. That was the way
                    the teams were set up on paper. Now in practice several inspections that I did,
                    I was the team leader on them. In one case illness on the part of the
                    ex-Ambassador team leader. In another case unexpected death during the time they
                    were out one year of a team leader who had been leader of my team. In maybe two
                    other cases, it was just that we were going to relatively small posts and the
                    expectation was that I could lead the team and handle it pretty well. It was a
                    smaller team. I'd say we had about six go along. In any event I did that part of
                    the time as team leader and I would say the majority of the time, two-thirds of
                    the time as deputy. That was the way they were set up. Now what did I personally
                    do? The team leader looks at obviously in effect he runs the team when they are
                    overseas. He decides how they are going to do the interviews, he does the basic
                    interviewing and so on. He always looks at how the Ambassador handles
                    coordination of the activities of the various agencies. He looks at what the
                    Ambassador himself does and what the Deputy Chief of Mission does. He looks at
                    special problems that might come up, sometimes with the assistance of a
                    specialist on the team who sometimes is more familiar than he is about those
                    special problems. So, that is essentially the way it was set up. Maybe I'll just
                    mention quickly the countries. My first inspection was a post in Germany. I
                    personally stayed at Bonn the entire time while the team leader went around and
                    took the team to the various consulates and also spent the beginning of the
                    inspection in Bonn and the end of the inspection in Bonn. Then, let me see, I
                    think after that came emergency management in the U.S. government not only
                    looking at the operations center of the Department of State at the Federal
                    Emergency Management operations center. We looked at the CIA and several other
                    government agencies, the various military agencies, how they did it, how the
                    White House did it, how the Department of Commerce did it, how other people did
                    the same thing. We made some recommendations. We were for all the services. We
                    were focusing on State Department, but we made recommendations on the others as
                    well. Then I believe I went to West Africa. Then I did a central Africa
                    inspection. In '88 I think that was the year I went to England and inspected a
                    post in England. Then I did an inspection of the medical division of the
                    Department of State. Then went to the Far East, Southeast Asia, hit Thailand,
                    Laos, Burma. I am getting a little out of order. Did the Soviet Union, then
                    Eastern Europe I think. Back to Africa to some of the West African posts. Then I
                    retired. Then I revived the, since I was sort of had a unique background for
                    that having done a variety of things in the Foreign Service myself and
                    everything in the State Department, I spent about six months revising the
                    inspectors manuals. We got a whole new at that point very up to date manual out
                    at that time. Then as a reward for that work I went along as Deputy Team Leader
                    to five posts in Spain and the agency I mentioned yesterday got the Canary
                    Islands. Then after it is still going on in 1992 we had to come back with the
                    WAE I think it was office of special operations. Things that didn't fit right in
                    to everything, and I was the only ex-Foreign Service officer on a couple of
                    projects doing a management survey of a number of posts in ex-Soviet Union. We
                    had been asked by the Bureau of European Affairs to do that. It wasn't
                    technically an inspection, but we made a number of recommendations, none of
                    which had to be complied with in the regular process. They were intended to help
                    the post set up their operations in new buildings and the sorts of things they
                    were getting into, acquiring a new residence, hiring new staff, looking at
                    problems that were coming up, making suggestions on how they could resolve those
                    problems. Just by the luck of the draw, I went to all the ex-Christian
                    republics, while another team went and did the Muslim republics of the Soviet
                    Union. And we had to of course go by Helsinki and Moscow in preparation for
                    that. These were, what resulted was a list of, not a very extensive list of
                    management suggestions. We did not evaluate anything. There were no performance
                    reports done on anybody, that sort of thing. The bureau could then take those
                    and do what they wish with them. They actually implemented the great majority of
                    them that we recommended insofar as funds permitted and insofar as they could.
                    They rather liked it so well that several years later they asked that we come
                    back and do it again. I was contacted once again by OIG to see if I would be
                    interested in going again and doing a rehash of that. It turned out that OIG
                    didn't have the funds to bring in anybody from the outside at that time. A few
                    people did go and do an abbreviated version of such a survey. That was my final
                    thing, The thing before that once again I was asked to come back to WAA in '92
                    to conduct a study of the hiring of Americans to professional positions in the
                    United Nations and several of the United Nations agencies, the Food and
                    Agricultural Agency at Rome, the UNIDO, the industrial development organization,
                    the International Atomic Energy Agency, and several other agencies including the
                    International agency for refugees, and the International labor organization at
                    Geneva. I looked at the secretariat up in New York and looked at the operations
                    of the Pan American Health Organization in Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>Q: I wonder if you could comment on a couple of sort of broad topics. One is you
                    mentioned how the audit section became much bigger than anything else. I recall
                    coming in at the State Department after being overseas and seeing big signs
                    “Report waste, fraud and mismanagement” all good but I kept thinking that here
                    is an organization where we get shot at and get killed and the most inspiring
                    think you find on the walls of the Department of State is “Report waste, fraud
                    and mismanagement.” Part of that is as a practical thing, we don't really have
                    much to waste or defraud with, or maybe we mismanage, but compared to almost any
                    other government agency we don't have a lot to audit. I mean we don't disburse
                    large funds and all that. It seems like it was an organization set up, I mean if
                    you are Inspector General, you have got to audit a lot of stuff, and they placed
                    heavy emphasis on that where we probably needed more work on getting people to
                    do their job better. Did this strike you?</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yes and no. Certainly we couldn't have as much waste, fraud, or
                    mismanagement as organizations like the Department of State, HEW, the big budget
                    people who handle big bucks. What we handle is pretty hard compared to that. On
                    the other hand waste, fraud, and mismanagement, if you take abroad definition of
                    mismanagement. Mismanagement which is not illegal but should be improved is the
                    bread and butter of inspection corps throughout the government. It was what
                    Sherman Font came over as his focus. It is something that the inspection corps
                    per se had always as well as the director general's office been responsible for
                    looking at and eliminate and try to improve in the Department of State. It is
                    possible that this may have been overemphasized. We were all alert all others in
                    all elements of the inspection of the office of IG to those very things. If a
                    report came in, normally it would go to the IG or the Deputy IG or one of his
                    designees, and they would decide what office, that is what division of the
                    Inspector General's office would be most appropriate to handle it. If it
                    involved stealing from the U.S. government, misappropriation of funds, that sort
                    of thing, normally it went to a division that I forgot to mention, that was the
                    investigations division. They were gumshoes. Most of them had a police
                    background. Most of them had some sort of legal training. They were very careful
                    to not cause anything they did an unsuccessful prosecution, the persons rights
                    being violated in the course of the investigation, that sort of thing. They
                    handled that sort of thing, that was basically fraud, the office of
                    investigations. If the others got too deeply into a situation where fraud was
                    involved, they were instructed to kick it over to these other guys.
                    Mismanagement was more what the rest of us looked at. Audits, they say in the
                    office of IG that the inspectors look an inch deep and a mile wide. They look at
                    everything that goes on at a post, but they don't go very deep down. The
                    auditors do the reverse; they look an inch wide and a mile deep. They would
                    thoroughly check out some aspect of post or bureau or department performance.
                    Investigations, I already said what those guys do. Security oversight really
                    only got started about a year or so later. The reason is it was a turf battle
                    between CIA and the Department of State as to who would handle security
                    inspections and security improvements, that sort of thing. The final resolution
                    of it was it was to be handled excluding certain CIA operations, these were only
                    a very few CIA operations, it was all handled by a joint office of security
                    investigations placed in the Department of State and which would operate
                    essentially under the authority of the State Department, but it had some
                    personnel from the other agencies. It was supposed to avoid both of them having
                    to do security inspections of posts. Than only got started about a year or so
                    after I got there. These groups went out separately. Occasionally we would have
                    somebody from audits detailed to inspections and on rare occasions vice versa to
                    sort of gain a little experience in the other operations. The security oversight
                    always had on their teams a former Foreign Service officer, every one of them I
                    think when they went out and did their security inspections. Now we did security
                    inspections too; we looked at this mile wide thing. So, we also inspected
                    security, but not to the same extent that these guys did. They didn't go to
                    every post; they only went to the posts where there was a real security
                    problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>Q: I'm not quite sure why CIA would have a legitimate concern about security.
                    They could say there is a threat, but as far as going to a post and figuring out
                    how to deal with it, it doesn't bring any particular expertise. I mean it lets
                    you know if a bomber might be coming, but as far as protecting against the
                    bomber, that should be sort of an overt activity.</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Their input into the office of security oversight was not in the sort
                    of physical security we are talking about. It was largely communications
                    security. It was potential penetration into agency or Embassy operations. It was
                    cover. It was sort of things that were unique to their...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see, so when you are talking about security...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yes, it is very broad. They did not have a majority of people on these
                    teams. Are the bars adequate on this window or do you need more Marine security
                    guards or do you need Marine security guards, that, the CIA man would not get
                    involved with.</p>
                <p>Q: Since you brought it up. Something that you had mentioned in Guayaquil and I
                    think many of us in the Foreign Service see but we say among ourselves but don't
                    say publicly, the dubious nature of the protection that the Marine guards give.
                    Most of us have seen other countries where they have usually married retired
                    military men. You get maturity, you don't have young 20 year old guys who are
                    going to go out and get drunk. In many ways the Marines look nice but we are
                    better off with a retired police sergeant or somebody like that. Is that a thing
                    you addressed at all in this.</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: We addressed the issue certainly of do you need Marine security guards
                    at a given post. Some posts that didn't have them, some posts that did have
                    them. We certainly disagreed with the Department's conclusion on several
                    occasions, several marginal cases. I recall one case where we recommended that
                    serious consideration be given to bringing in Marine security guards. In several
                    of the other cases we reiterated that where there were no Marine security guards
                    that they did not need them. In at least one case that I recall vaguely we said
                    we saw no real reason for the marine security guards that were there, that they
                    could be pulled out because there were some problems that they caused. In
                    principle I think it is a wasteful procedure at many posts. The total cost to
                    the United States of training these people, sending them for one or two tours as
                    Marine security guards and then sending them back to other duties really costs
                    much more than getting a professional security guard force of former police
                    people. They would almost have to have impeccable backgrounds as far as beating
                    their wives or husbands or stealing or being scorned by others. That would be a
                    more efficient way to go I think financially speaking. There are other places
                    where a sort of uniformed military force has dissuasive impact on potential
                    terrorists coming in and that sort of thing. It is hard to make a generalized
                    statement. If I would have to make a generalized statement, I believe the way
                    that France and the Brits and some other countries do it is a better way.</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>Q: Retreating just once more to the audit side. I remember when the new Foreign
                    Service act came in, and I really didn't have much to do with it personally
                    because I was retired when the full impact hit, but there was sort of corridor
                    talk about you have to be very careful with these inspectors, particularly the
                    auditors because they re out to get you. I'm not trying to say you shouldn't be
                    doing this because they are out after scalps, and that if you are dealing with
                    them you really had better have your own lawyer and all this. What was your
                    impression of that?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Certainly some scalps. They relatively rarely started an audit of
                    something unless they had a decent idea that there were some problems there, and
                    they were specifically looking for the problems. I think occasionally, in fact I
                    know that the IG and some of the Assistant IG's would say hey you guys have to
                    go out and be helpful. Otherwise people are going to hold things back. If you
                    find a minor problem say this is the way to correct it. We are not going to send
                    you to jail because of it, but this is kind of a sloppy way to do things. On the
                    other hand there is a natural human tendency particularly among people who
                    haven't been in those positions before, and that is one of the negatives of
                    bringing in outside inspectors, people who haven't been in it say aha, these
                    asses don't know what they are doing. A good auditor would have had this done
                    already, and we are going to show why these non audit trained people really just
                    don't have a clue to the way it should be set up. Also the auditors spent a
                    tremendous amount of time on things, as I said a mile deep and an inch wide,
                    things that we as inspectors would have spent a fraction of the time. I think in
                    most cases we would have come up with a decent evaluation and some
                    recommendations with a lot less manpower involved than the auditors did. We set
                    schedules and we knew we had to do our inspection and get out of there by X day.
                    We sometimes had to as they say colloquially bust a gut trying to do that, while
                    the auditors say well this may take us three weeks, four weeks, sometimes it
                    would drag on for six weeks. They have to have three more people come in to help
                    them. Okay, that's the way audits are. They follow the trail wherever it leads
                    taking as much time as they need. There is a need for that. I did not think the
                    allocation of personnel was as it should be. I thought there were plenty of
                    people in OIG at one point the only part of State Department that seemed to be
                    mushrooming fully was the Office of Inspector General. As I recall we had in the
                    office 200-250, I don't remember the exact number of personnel. Forty to fifty
                    of them including the secretaries in the office in Washington were in the Office
                    of Inspections. I thought that was too many. I thought the personnel should have
                    been more useful elsewhere in some cases. I don't mean cut it to the bone.
                    Instead of let's say, I'm pulling a figure out of the air, 230 or so. Instead of
                    that, you could have gotten the same work I thought equally efficiently or with
                    more efficiency with maybe 100.</p>
                <p>Q: During that time, you were there five years, what was your impression about
                    what the inspections were turning up in the way of waste, fraud and
                    mismanagement?</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Inspections probably didn't turn up a huge amount of it. We turned up
                    some, yes. We made numbers of recommendations. There was one officer who was
                    transferred out early as a result of our recommendations because of some, in
                    this case it was exchange rate problems. The fact that you were supposed to
                    follow the official exchange rate, after all your allowances were based on the
                    prices of the official exchange rate. Instead he setting the example he and the
                    Embassy were purchasing funds on the so-called black market which was illegal
                    and doing it without even covering his tracks very well. Things like that. We
                    did find a couple of commissaries where people were stealing money from a couple
                    of commissaries, not Americans. We found another case where there was a great
                    deal of hanky-panky going on in the motor pool. Gasoline was being used at about
                    twice the rate that similar vehicles did per gallon elsewhere. It was obviously
                    being sold outside. Some private vehicles were being worked on, on government
                    time by the mechanics, a number of things of that nature. In one case U.S.
                    government vehicles were being used as I recall as taxis during part of the day
                    by U.S. government drivers. The actual people doing these things were mostly
                    local nationals, and local nationals where you could expect these things to go
                    on, where public morality is not the highest. In some cases an American was
                    involved in property troubles, not in every case of this nature. Other ideas of
                    impropriety, the Ambassador would allocate by putting pressure on his advent
                    officer a great deal more money than should have been spent on the official
                    residence and furnishings for the official residence. Not illegal in these cases
                    but certainly what we would call mismanagement. In many other cases the most
                    common form of mismanagement was bad staffing, bad use of personnel. A lot of
                    that we came across. That is not a criminal offense in any way shape or form.
                    That is the traditional sort of thing that inspectors look at. We made, and I
                    being a policy oriented person insisted on in many reports and usually my team
                    leader would back me up if there was a team leader, and if I led the team it was
                    my responsibility of making policy recommendations. In none of the posts I
                    inspected was I a deep expert on. In some of them I spoke the language; in some
                    I didn't, but where a policy just seemed to be pretty clearly wrong or wasteful
                    or something of that nature, where there was an AID program in a place where
                    there was no earthly need for the United States to have an AID program. The AID
                    program was just spinning its wheels and spending money and not getting
                    anywhere, I would recommend things like abolishing the AID program. In one case
                    we recommended increasing it somewhat because it was trying to do far more than
                    it had the personnel to do, but that was the only case I remember of that
                    nature. Usually AID was better staffed than we were when they were in a country.
                    Most countries we didn't have them. USIA was somewhat similar to ours. We didn't
                    look into that much detail if you had a USIA operation, but we would make
                    recommendations on the gamut of U.S. government operations. We would have
                    numerous recommendations. In the team that I was on I remember having a greater
                    number of recommendations for the time we were there than I think than any other
                    team. We were not always known favorably because of that. I mean my god if you
                    come back, I don't remember the number we had. I remember I went over with one
                    other person to inspect an Embassy on Cape Verde, and I think we came back with
                    30 recommendations, something of that nature. How in the world could you come up
                    with 30 recommendations? All you need is three for a little post like that.
                    There were at least 30 things we thought were useful to change. In some cases
                    the recommendation is not directed at the post. In many cases they were directed
                    at the Department of State or somebody else. You need to give the post support
                    in X, Y, or Z. The post needs this you need to or some element of the Department
                    needs to supply them with such and such. That element of the Department has to
                    respond to the post. Of course we did on elements of the Department, on bureaus
                    or offices in the Department. Obviously we could find more recommendations for
                    them.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>Q: Would you find any both in general and maybe comment specifically problems
                    between political Ambassadors and career Ambassadors. I'm really thinking there
                    are politically appointed Ambassadors who have been doing this for a lot and
                    they are the equivalent to a career Ambassador. I'm talking about really maybe
                    the person who was a professor and who may be a good contributor going out to a
                    post for the first time. Did you find a problem with that?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Probably not as much as I encountered in my Foreign Service career
                    before I came on inspections. I think the political Ambassadors were aware that
                    a lot of people were going to be looking over their shoulders. In some cases
                    they got there ready to use their previous style as a land developer or whatever
                    they had been before they became a heavy hitter with the party and said by god
                    we are going to run it with half the personnel twice as efficiently, and they
                    got there and said where is the secretary to handle this, where is the person to
                    handle that, and they weren't there. Then they said, “My god, I guess I can't
                    cut these personnel anyway because I'll be cutting my own throat,” and then they
                    would start pumping for some more personnel, particularly up in their office.
                    There were some problems we ran into. One the politically appointed Ambassador's
                    wife didn't speak the language. It was a non-English speaking post. In one case
                    in particular he was trying his best, learning hard, and I think he had some
                    useful knowledge of the language. In some cases they really tried to learn the
                    history, background, culture; in some cases they didn't. We didn't inspect
                    actually that many political Ambassadors, my team didn't. We inspected
                    overwhelmingly career Ambassadors. We had several political Ambassadors we did
                    look at. I was fairly well impressed with most of those we looked at. One to the
                    court of St. James in England we looked at had a deft touch with people. He was
                    going to be one of the staff. He would wander down, generally he didn't have
                    representational type of business luncheons. He would try to lunch most of the
                    time with people there, even had lunch at his desk. He would go down to the
                    cafeteria and look around and whoever was sitting by himself or two or three
                    people, and he would sit down and mind if I join you. They would sit and talk
                    about how things were going along. This was probably one of our most important
                    posts, London. Essentially he had a good DCM. He was relying on his DCM for a
                    lot of advice. This particular Ambassador had been around U.S. government for
                    some time. Yes, he served as an Ambassador before, down in Central America. So
                    he was real. He was not a typical Ambassador, and obviously English was the
                    language. In my opinion he was doing a considerably better job than his
                    predecessor who was also political. London, you don't give to a career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another thing too is that he graduated from probably the
                        premiecollege in the United States, Williams.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: We graduated, I think he was a year behind me, but othethan that.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>Q: Well Williams gave a good sense of interpersonal relations. I will say that.
                    What about as inspectors, it used to be that inspectors were a very important
                    part of the personnel procedure for promotions and assignments particularly at
                    smaller posts. Often he might not be the greatest supervisory officer and so the
                    inspectors could come along and see if there was a problem personally or a
                    problem with the post, and for promotion panels, having served on one, you look
                    rather hard at the inspector's report. But this was beginning to change wasn't
                    it?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: It was. We were only writing inspector's reports on the ambassador and
                    I believe the DCM. I'm not sure about the DCM. I know we did it on the
                    ambassadors and the principal officers. We were not writing them on other people
                    unless we in looking over recent inspection reports for people who had been
                    there long enough to have one, we found a conclusion with which we strongly
                    disagreed. In those cases we had the right to write an inspector's report, in
                    effect setting the record straight as we saw it. We didn't try to evaluate every
                    aspect of the person's performance. We tried to set the record straight. That
                    was really rather rare, but we did it a few times. I did it a couple of times,
                    maybe more, but not often. While I was happy we didn't have to do that chore, as
                    a Foreign Service officer and as a person who I hope was dedicated to improving
                    the performance of the State Department, I reported that this had been done away
                    with. I found when I was in personnel that we gave more weight as the selection
                    boards did to those reports than to those reports that were written on the
                    people, and I think there has been an inflation in grading people in the regular
                    report. It is obvious that the supervisor and the person working for him
                    generally established a suitable working relationship. He wants to continue to
                    get good work out of that person. He has to live with that person every day. The
                    person can appeal the report, and it is a lot of trouble to fight an appeal, all
                    sorts of bias caused you to say bad things about me or caused you to say that I
                    don't walk on water, that I just swim like an Olympic swimmer. That is not good
                    enough. I'm supposed to walk on water. You are placing me at a disadvantage with
                    my peers. So, too many reports are kind of meaningless. You have got to put it
                    under a bigger magnifying glass than you did in your and my day for personnel
                    reports than you did back then. Inspector reports in the old days and even now,
                    you don't really care about what they think about you once you leave post. Most
                    of the people you don't know that intimately before you get there. You may have
                    served with some of them, but most of them you didn't. You are inclined as an
                    inspector, like inspectors always did, to call it as you see it. You are looking
                    at a situation at a particular time, you are not looking at a big slice of time
                    like your annual reports do. I thought they were very valuable and I deplore
                    that the inspectors are no longer writing them. If you are not required to
                    write, let's face it you are not going to write it unless you see some real
                    injustice for or against the individual.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you see any particular problems with or were you alert to any particular
                    problems concerned with the visa function? Here is one place where there is
                    tremendous pressure on the local staff particularly in some posts where visas
                    are highly desirable. Applicants are willing to do just anything.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yes. We always had a consular inspector or someone, for the smaller
                    posts it may not have been a consular specialist with us, but for the larger
                    posts we certainly did. Of course, the visa function was what generally occupied
                    the majority of the time of the inspection of that particular officer.
                    Citizenship functions weren't generally that time consuming. Generally they were
                    handled correctly and the passports were controlled, but most of the time was
                    spent looking at visas and there was always something in his mind that he tried
                    to check and make sure that all the procedures were being followed and shortcuts
                    weren't being taken and we didn't rely too much on a local that could be
                    suborned for his lies and that an officer did really look at each visa
                    applicant. He may not have interviewed each one; he sort of should have. Yes, I
                    personally didn't spend that much time on it. When I was either team leader or
                    deputy team leader and had to review the work of the person who was doing the
                    consular inspection, of course. But, if I had confidence in him, I would ask a
                    few questions and hopefully he would handle it pretty well. We didn't have
                    trouble to be honest, with as many problems of visa fraud as I would have
                    thought. At posts where I had served, we had a couple of instances of visa
                    fraud. One person was drummed out of the Foreign Service and prosecuted for
                    selling visas where I served. Happily, he left shortly after I got there. This
                    came out only after he had left. But, based on experiences of my own at posts
                    where I had run into it, I had really thought we'd come up with more. It might
                    mean that our consular officers weren't looking carefully enough perhaps. You
                    never know. If you don't find it, did you not find it because you didn't look
                    hard enough or because it wasn't there.</p>
                <p>Q: I would have thought on the consular side that you would have found a
                    particular problem when you were inspecting the various posts in Africa, small
                    countries, usually a junior officer on their first tour. The problem being only
                    that it is an officer on his first tour, and often there wasn't much consular
                    backup where a superior officer, a DCM never touched a visa in his life, that
                    type of thing, they were on their own. Was this a problem?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: We did. We did find more certainly on visa where per officer there were
                    more problems at small posts than we did at the larger posts. If you have a
                    conscientious officer, one advantage or reason we didn't find more. If you have
                    a conscientious officer and he hadn't done visa work before, he relied rather
                    heavily on the manual. If you go to him and if you go by what the manual says,
                    it tells you how to do the thing and what you should look at and this, that and
                    the other. So, those who were conscientious did a pretty good job. Also, at
                    those posts, they generally spent a lot more time with visa applicants than
                    other posts did. As a result, there you did have the officer actually looking at
                    and oftentimes interviewing every visa applicant, while at the big posts they
                    sloughed it off. It became so routine, if you were at London or somewhere like
                    that, or if you were at a post where there was a heavier volume, particularly at
                    some of the posts where you could have the visa requirement waived, you tend not
                    to look as carefully at each person. Therefore it is easier for a ringer to slip
                    through. So, yes, we certainly did have more recommendations certainly per
                    capita, per person at small posts. As I recall you did have a regional consular
                    officer who went around to those small posts and tried to resolve the
                    problems.</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>Q: What about, you were hitting the Soviet Union and Europe about the time the
                    whole place was falling apart and became reconstructed, the key here being
                    around December, '89. Were you getting after some of that, and what was your
                    impression of the situation?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Things were opening up and the Embassies were amazed. In Moscow, I
                    handled the political section and the coordination with other agencies doing
                    political work, the defense attaches and shop. I won't go into, and a couple of
                    others. Much of my work was on the political section, and there the people were
                    just in seventh heaven. They were just trying to pries little tidbits of
                    information they could build on and they would try to confirm somewhere else out
                    of context. They were then having contacts on their office telephones and, “Look
                    there are some things I would really like to talk to you about. Can you meet
                    somewhere for lunch next week or day after tomorrow?” In some cases they would
                    say can I come by the Embassy. Well, that was very difficult because usually the
                    Russian authorities, the police weren't letting people in. But they would always
                    try to hold the person down on it. He'd say, “I want to tell you about
                    something; why don't we get together for lunch.” Of course the phone were
                    tapped; the walls were tapped; the directional things were heading toward the
                    windows, and you had to stifle some while you were there with the drapes closed
                    because from the big tower right over there, the things were directed right at
                    you. It was happening, and they were in seventh heaven. They were getting what
                    they thought was useful information. Nobody there in '88 thought that it would
                    open up as quickly as it did. Certainly we were not in a position to second
                    guess them. The biggest problem that I found on the policy standpoint in the
                    Soviet Union was our refugee policy. It was politically driven. If you were
                    Jewish or Armenian, because those were the two most politically potent people in
                    the United States, all you had to do if you were Jewish or Armenian to get
                    refugee status, was you had to be Jewish or Armenian. You didn't have to be
                    under any pressure, under any persecution or any sort of thing. If you weren't
                    Jewish or Armenian, you really had to present quite a visa case for political
                    persecution. The major policy problem I found was really based on U.S. political
                    pressures there at the Embassy was the refugee policy. If you were Jewish or
                    Armenian at that time in the summer of '88, all you had to be was Jewish or
                    Armenian to get automatic consideration. Technically it wasn't automatic, but de
                    facto it was to be a refugee. You just came in and filled out all your papers.
                    You did the proper thing and you were a refugee if you wanted to go to the
                    United States, even though you might not have been under any sort of
                    persecution, even though no one was going to dump on you because of that, it was
                    a political thing from within the United States. We found that the people in the
                    consular section in the Ambassador's office agreed to it, but they said Hey,
                    this is politically untouchable. We just can't do it. That is the way the thing
                    worked, and it was a rampant injustice there. We did make recommendations
                    against it which the bureau looked and said hey what are you asking us to do?
                    That's policy. Our recommendations as I recall were that the Department should
                    inform Congress and so on, but what could you do? All you could do was put it
                    down on paper. So that somebody if they wanted to, and we always made that sort
                    of a recommendation unclassified. Whenever we wanted someone to pick something
                    out of our report, we did our best to make that element unclassified, so anyone
                    could pick it out and run with it if they wanted to.</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>Q: Did that discrimination cause any problem particularly with younger officers
                    who tend to see things in black and white and they see injustice. The more
                    experienced officers were beaten over the head so much that they just sort of
                    shrug their shoulders and say that's the way it is. Was there a problem?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I think it was to a certain extent a problem among the consular
                    officers and some of the political officers. We saw this as absolute nonsense,
                    just pure political payoff in the United States that is causing this. On the
                    other hand, they were busy doing their jobs and after all they were people about
                    25 years old and they had been around awhile and were aware that is just the
                    politics in the United States. We probably cannot change the way the U.S.
                    government operates and the way political payoffs are made. About all you could
                    do is the sort of thing we did. You made it unclassified, and you told other
                    people back in the States when you got there in the hope that maybe somebody
                    would pick it up and use it to back up their position later.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned that you were looking at the UN hiring practice. Could you talk
                    about that and your impression of how it worked? I mean what were the parameters
                    that you were looking at and what you found?</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: The situation was in almost all the UN organs there were a number of
                    professionals who were Americans who were on the roll anyway was significantly
                    less than our contribution to that particular organ or to the Secretariat of the
                    United Nations. The question was what can we do to bring that up so the number
                    of American professionals working there was more in accord with out percentage
                    of contribution to the UN. Now, employees of the United Nations, particularly
                    professional level employees, are not supposed to represent any government. They
                    are supposed to hire basically the most qualified people, and once you are
                    hired, your loyalty in things to do with your work is to your institution, not
                    the government of which you are a citizen. The United Nations should not do
                    anything that is treasonous to their government, but you should not do any
                    special favors for your government. It is an international civil service. That
                    having been said, there were in some cases sort of informal quotas. They didn't
                    really favor either the United States or Japan. They favored Japan even less
                    than they did the United States. Some of the European countries seemed to
                    benefit the most from it. You had many people far in excess of contribution from
                    places like Belgium, Austria, some of the smaller European countries,
                    Scandinavian countries. Occasionally you would get a large number because of
                    nepotism or cliqueism from a particular African country. I recall, I believe it
                    was the ILO, although I may be wrong on my agency, of the top six officials, two
                    of them were Benninine or Togolese, one or the other. Then if you went down to
                    the next levee, you found a disproportionate number from that same country. The
                    first one who got on there would try to bring these others on too. There were
                    reasons why the number of Americans was relatively small. We did feel in most of
                    those agencies, they could be brought up substantially. We needed to put some
                    pressure on some of them to bring it up substantially. I did recommend, I guess
                    it was one of my specific recommendations at spending a week at UNIDO, the
                    United Nations Organization for Industrial Development, where we had only
                    something like four or five percent of the professional level people, and we
                    contributed significantly more than that to the organization. I did not see any
                    need for the United States to stay a member of that organization. We had some
                    problems getting the sort of information we needed. It was a delicate thing. We
                    were asking for a personnel file in some cases and personnel information in all
                    cases. Sometimes they felt hey we don't give out that information. Certainly
                    with the individual personnel files, we could understand why that would be a
                    little touchy. We did get personnel files from most organizations that we were
                    interested in. Why was this person hired. In some cases we knew that let's say
                    there were five finalists for a particular position. Three of them were U.S.
                    citizens, and a U.S. citizen was not hired. What were the differences between
                    the person that was hired and the U.S. citizen? In most cases there was some
                    difference whereby the U.S. citizen maybe didn't have as many languages as the
                    other person did. After all, the Europeans in particular and in some cases the
                    Middle Easterners are more fluent in more languages. In some cases it was a
                    degree question, but not usually. In other cases we felt it was just sort of
                    bias. We did recommend that the United States withdraw from UNIDO, and that in
                    fact did take place a couple of years later. I'm not saying that it is because
                    of my recommendation that we did. I think that may have been added to the pile
                    of reasons that we did withdraw.</p>

                <p>Q: Looking at all these inspections, were there any particular countries or
                    incidents that you had to deal with that particularly stand out or that you
                    would like to mention?</p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Well, I mentioned the problem of exchange rates, and we had to rap the
                    knuckles of an Ambassador, I'd rather not get into details in this conversation
                    as to which one, but we did have to rap the knuckles of an Ambassador and an
                    Embassy about that. That was a real problem, and we asked that policy be
                    revisited. In this particular case, it was a country with which we did not have
                    good relations. In this particular case the country had a grossly official
                    exchange rate that was grossly out of any real consideration. The black market
                    there was rampant, and there was a way to purchase currency legally out of
                    country, and bring it in through the diplomatic pouch into the country as a
                    number of other Embassies did. A number of other Embassies were doing that
                    without we thought any significant negative repercussions. The government may
                    have objected to that when it became known that it was being brought in through
                    the diplomatic pouch, but so what in this case. We were not anxious to please
                    that particular government in any event. We thought there were several other
                    countries where this could be done, and if it became enough of a problem, we
                    would simply tell the government then change your bloody official exchange rate
                    because it was costing the U.S. taxpayer one heck of a lot more money than
                    otherwise. Well, we made some of those. They were weasely after we came because
                    you have to rap them because that is what the policy is and you have to abide by
                    the policy. We made recommendations for changing the policy, but we had to say
                    it in the Department office of whatever should consider such and such and we
                    gave the rationale. It would have required a major change. I mentioned the
                    refugee thing in the ex-Soviet Union. In many cases we uncovered a lot of
                    security problems. There were a lot of cases where we made recommendations. We
                    found a lot of horrendous security violations at this Embassy that nobody had
                    looked at. Physical security, personal security. We found some cases where we
                    thought the personal security was exaggerated. People were still getting home to
                    office transportation on security grounds where there was no security threat
                    whatsoever. Clearly the home to office transportation, the embassy driven car
                    was purely for the convenience of the person. In those cases we recommended that
                    it be cut out if the Ambassador did not certify that. In other cases you know
                    that the Ambassador can certify that the local transportation is not adequate
                    and that is the reason you have it. In some cases transportation was more
                    adequate than it is in the Washington, DC area. The Ambassador still said it was
                    not adequate. We blew the whistle on that. I mentioned policy. I think the other
                    day toward Yugoslavia I concluded and the team finally bought it, and I think it
                    stayed in the final version, that our policy ever since W.W.II had been to hold
                    the country together. All around Eastern Europe, undemocratic regimes were
                    falling. Yugoslavia was one of the relatively few that were not being changed,
                    and that we felt the policy should be shifted from holding it together to
                    encouraging democracy. Even though that inevitably meant and we knew it and put
                    it in our report, the country would break up. With the Soviet Union having been
                    changed by that time or in the process of changing, I'm talking about '89 now,
                    that there was no particular security reason or cold war reason that we had for
                    Yugoslavia to stay together. If the people wanted to separate, let them
                    separate. The policy eventually did change, although it did not change as a
                    result of our report, though our report may have had something to do with it. As
                    I recall, the European Bureau's response was in effect we hear what you are
                    saying but policy like that is something that the regional bureau makes the
                    decision on, our superiors in the Department of State and the President of the
                    United States, not something that inspectors should be able to look at. Other
                    things, we questioned in a few cases whether an Embassy needed to continue. In
                    some of the West African countries we felt that having either a resident
                    representative, sort of one officer on the scene buttressed by specialists from
                    sort of a regional Embassy would be a lot more effective way to handle things.
                    In a couple of instances we questioned, well, we certainly questioned in a case
                    like Mauritania whether we needed an AID mission of any sort there. In some of
                    the other African countries we felt that it should be cut back or cut out. We
                    had more people than needed for our interests and in some countries we thought
                    we had fewer than we needed for our interests by one or two. In other countries
                    we found other agencies grossly out of proportion to the Department of State for
                    out interests including the CIA in one or two places.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>Q: Did you find in that, my impression is that if you have a lot of people from
                    other agencies including things like Treasury or Civil Aviation, they tend to
                    end up in the nicer posts in the area rather than the more difficult,
                    challenging posts.</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Except for AID and CIA of course. Sure, but that is logical because,
                    let's face it, you don't have those people unless you have little security
                    threat. If there is much of a security threat, you don't want to burden the post
                    with people of that nature which could be established regionally almost
                    anywhere. The more out of the way disagreeable posts were usually the smaller
                    posts. Usually less important posts too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Turning away from the time you were inspector, is there
                        anythinelse you think we should cover on inspection?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I mentioned there was an evolution in the inspection corps away from
                    the number of Foreign Service officers toward a professional inspection corps. I
                    found that was dangerous in two ways. One, Foreign Service is so distinct from
                    civil service and other government operations domestically, that you need
                    someone with long and varied experience, particularly as a team leader but also
                    for certain other aspects of what Foreign Service people do. I felt that the
                    majority of the inspection corps particularly should remain Foreign Service on
                    into the indefinite future. I could see an exception to that for some people
                    that are approaching retirement age or even some that aren't approaching
                    retirement age, there are a certain number of Foreign Service officers who for
                    family reasons, health reasons, other reasons, not really health because health
                    doesn't apply in this case, but family or other reasons, don't want to stay in
                    Foreign Service. They beg for and want domestic assignments and get domestic
                    assignments. There is no reason that a person of that nature who is no longer
                    interested in a career in the Foreign Service shouldn't transfer over to the
                    inspection corps, become civil service, and continue on. He would have all those
                    advantages that a Foreign Service officer had. The one advantage he wouldn't
                    have; he wouldn't be considered a peer after a certain number of years by the
                    people he's inspecting. That is also important and that I think you are losing
                    in the inspection corps today. The people there say, “Good lord, they make this
                    recommendation; they don't now what they are talking about. They don't really
                    know what we are doing.” Well, in some cases, if the civil service inspectors
                    inspected enough posts, he has sort of performed it, but he can't quite put
                    himself into those shoes. He can't quite I remember this broad problem and what
                    a difficult time we had solving it. It was in my second or third year as chief
                    of a consular section did that sort of thing come out. It came out in the
                    following way. I can sort of understand that. The other person would say, “Why
                    didn't you get on to this the second day you were on the job?” So there are
                    those two dangers, and I think they may have gone too far in establishing the so
                    called inspection corps. One of the reasons the inspectors in the civil service
                    say we have got to go easy on this post and so on because they may run into that
                    Ambassador again, and he may be vital to their assignment or that officer again.
                    They may have known him at a previous post. They may have worked for him though
                    it may have been five or ten years ago. He worked for him and he knows some
                    indiscretions that officer might have committed theoretically at some post;
                    therefore, it is not as good as if it were a completely disinterested outside
                    observer who is trained in audit and trained in this, that and the other. So, I
                    would say those two things generally, primarily speaking. I'm not personally
                    acquainted with the current inspector. Font considered all those angles and
                    found not always on the side of the civil service inspector. Sometimes he would
                    come down on the side of the Foreign Service, that is the Foreign Service point
                    of view. He tried his best. He was a hard worker, and he tried his best to be
                    unbiased, and he was courageous and gutsy. That is the most important thing for
                    any inspector to have and to be, an Inspector General particularly. You have got
                    to be courageous and gutsy, and if you over rule your inspectors, over rule them
                    because they made a mistake, or they were unduly demanding, or they were simply
                    wrong. They didn't consider everything. Don't ever over rule them because hey
                    that could be impolitic, the pressures should be on the other side. The
                    inspector has to be gutsy enough to stand up to the political pressures. They
                    may never get anywhere like with our refugee thing because of political
                    pressures. You know when you are writing they are too strong, but an Inspector
                    General should let stuff like that stay in his report, and in this case our
                    Inspector General did.</p>

                <p>Q: Well, normally this would be the end. Wade, you did go and act as a monitor
                    for an election in Bosnia? Could you explain the background of this and what you
                    observed? This is still in the realm of foreign affairs and foreign
                    experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Well, I just returned a couple of weeks ago from Bosnia. I was there
                    actually as what they call an election supervisor rather than monitor per se.
                    There were some monitors, about 40-50 I think from various OSCE countries.
                    Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe was the organization that
                    paid my per diem while I was in the country to the sum of $95 a day out of which
                    I had to pay all of my expenses. I think they also paid our in country
                    transportation expenses while the Department of State paid our air
                    transportation until we got to Zagreb, Croatia. We processed in, in a couple of
                    hours and got some ID cards and were put on a bus and took off to, in my case,
                    Tuzla, which is the third largest city in Bosnia, and a predominantly Muslim
                    city. Our purpose while we were there was to supervise each and every precinct
                    in the country. There were 300+ Americans, I don't remember, about 360-370, and
                    there were about 22-2300 people from the various OSCE countries. Probably our
                    American contingent was as large as those from any other country. There were a
                    lot of French and Brits and Germans there. I think people from Turkestan were
                    there and Kazakstan some of the ex-Soviet Union countries. Organization of
                    Security and Cooperation in Europe, the members of it are every European country
                    including Turkey, including San Marino, including Monaco, what have you with the
                    exception of Andorra. The sheepherders of Andorra didn't decide to join. This
                    came out of the old Helsinki conference and the members also included the United
                    States and Canada and all the republics that have come out of the Soviet Union
                    including Russia. They are all members of it. Basically it is sort of the whole
                    northern part of the Northern Hemisphere and dipping down reasonably far south
                    in a few cases. That was the organization. The reason we were there was to lend
                    legitimacy to the municipal elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina. There were two
                    parts of it. The federation which is Croat and Muslim and the one which by
                    definition is Serb. The election was held in all the parties. There were
                    numerous parties, parties, coalitions what have you on the ballot. On my ballot
                    there were 15 different parties or coalitions. There were very complex electoral
                    procedures, extremely complex. Partly because it was a complex situation. You
                    didn't just go to your precinct and vote; you had the right to go to where you
                    once had lived but were driven out of by fear or ethnic cleansing to things of
                    that nature and vote in that precinct. You were trucked there or bussed there by
                    busses paid for by the OSCE, in some cases accompanied by stabilization force
                    military personnel. And you could go to a so called absentee voting station and
                    vote maybe 200 miles away or even out of the country even in Croatia or
                    Yugoslavia in the place where you once lived. Then all these ballots had to be
                    counted, safeguarded, had to be double counted to make sure there was no
                    suspicion of fraud. One copy of all the ballots had to be trucked in to
                    Sarajevo, fed into computers, and the process is still not over. I was just by
                    the Bosnia desk today, the Bosnia task force, and they have relatively few of
                    the results from the OSCE because they are still counting, comparing. If this
                    multiple copies of the list has any meaning, they have to be then compared. If
                    the central counting authority in Sarajevo got one set of figures and if the
                    count at the precinct at the evening of the second day of balloting showed
                    something else, and there is a discrepancy, what. What was the discrepancy? How
                    did it come about? Who is pulling the hanky-panky on whom? Was there some
                    mechanical error that should be corrected and so on. So it was a very complex
                    process. We heard that this is supposed to be the most expensive election on a
                    vote per cast basis in history. I am not talking about the electoral campaign; I
                    am talking about the electoral process itself. I suspect they are right. If I
                    were an inspector I would recommend a lot of things. One, you could compress the
                    time considerably. We had to have some training before the election. We had to
                    have some time to debrief afterwards, but we were there a shade over two weeks.
                    You could do the whole thing in a shade over one week and have you in and out of
                    there at considerably less expense, less cost. On Bosnia-Herzegovina I would say
                    the security problems are probably exaggerated. As long as you have some
                    stabilization force there, I don't think you are going to have a major event
                    there, I don't think warfare is going to break out, and I don't think we need
                    the roughly 400,000 that are there now. But you do need some, and I would say
                    you are going to have to have some for some time, much longer than President
                    Clinton would like with the intention of pulling people out next summer. If you
                    pulled everybody out next summer after having an overly large security force
                    there now and you pull out so that you have nobody there except a few police, I
                    think that would be very hazardous. I don't think necessarily from the Serbs. I
                    think the biggest danger now is from the Muslims who are strengthening their
                    military operation. I think if everybody got away, they would try and attack the
                    Serb positions. I think they could defeat the Serbs with no great problem, but
                    what happens with most of your Serbs who are sitting right across a river or
                    right across a border in some cases not all that well marked. I know a river in
                    what is now Yugoslavia, the old Yugoslav army, would they sit by and let the
                    Muslims drive all the Serbs out of Bosnia? I don't think so. I don't think the
                    Croat forces would sit by if the Muslim forces started in on the Croats as well.
                    If you get those two forces involved, the Muslim forces may have improved a lot,
                    but it hasn't improved enough to face those two enemies. So, you have the whole
                    Yugoslavia blowing up or a goodly part of it at least blowing up again. That is
                    the dilemma.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any personal experiences while you were
                        watching the voting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: No, my election committee, who I paid incidentally. I had to pay them
                    at the end of the counting, everybody including the chairman. Not a princely
                    amount, 150 marks for two days of very hard work by the chairman and 100 marks
                    for each of the six members of the election committee, all of whom had a job.
                    One would stand at the door and sort of control the line which never got too
                    long and check each individual to make sure that he didn't have the iridescent
                    ink on his finger which showed under a black light. Then the voter would go and
                    present his identification and have his identification checked. There were 12
                    different kinds of identification that were valid. Then you had to go over and
                    sign the register and have his name checked against the name in the register. If
                    his name wasn't in the register, there was another procedure, another form to
                    fill out. He cast what was called a tentative ballot which would be evaluated
                    later. Then he went over and got instructions on how to mark the ballot, was
                    handed the ballot. Somebody sprayed the little iridescent ink on his finger.
                    Then he went over an put it in the ballot box, Oh I'm sorry, then he went over
                    and marked the ballot in a secret sort of cardboard booth that was set up where
                    nobody could see him. Then he went over and folded it and put it in the ballot
                    box, and then walked out. That was the procedure. We had anywhere depending on
                    the time of day from three to ten political party observers who were sitting
                    over at another table watching this whole procedure and also watched the
                    counting of many of them. We had television people coming in, radio people, news
                    people coming in to record this great event, and it was interesting. I had an
                    interpreter since I don't speak Serbo-Croatian. Most of the monitors did not
                    speak Serbo-Croatian, and where ever they were from, whether they were Germans,
                    French, what have you, they had to have English as their language. Any who did
                    not speak Serbo-Croatian were assigned an interpreter, and most did not speak.
                    The only exceptions were the Kazakhs or the Tajiks one or the other. They
                    apparently couldn't find enough in their contingent of nine there, and I talked
                    with the director of this northern part of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the OSCE
                    elections force there. He said finally he found something to do with his reserve
                    force. His reserves were the Kazakhs and the Tajiks and they were going to send
                    them up to some polling stations where they had some real problems without
                    interpreters because they spoke Russian, of course, and the Serbs could
                    understand enough Russian so they could communicate. So that was basically it.
                    It was an interesting experience. I was just asked today if I would like to go
                    back for the elections in November. I told this officer no, not in November for
                    two reasons, I'm too tied up and, even if this climate and conditions were fine,
                    I could not. It gets cold in Bosnia.</p>
                <p>Q: Oh, yes. The wind comes down the plain and starts hitting those mountains.
                    Okay, Wade, we'll stop at this point. I thank you very much.</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I enjoyed it.</p>
