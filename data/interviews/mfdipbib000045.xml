                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give me information about yourself? When and
                        where you were born, a bit about your upbringing and education.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I was born in Lakewood, Ohio, in December of 1927, but moved to Memphis,
                    Tennessee, when I was eight years old. My formation is really southern. I went
                    to grammar school, junior high school, high school, in Memphis, Tennessee, and
                    then to the University of Tennessee. So despite my accent I am at heart really a
                    southerner.</p>
                <p>In the summer of 1943 I read a book called Diplomatically Speaking, by a man
                    named Lloyd C. Griscom, which convinced me that the only thing I ever wanted to
                    do in life was to be in the United States Foreign Service. Although there were
                    some shadings of that resolve, that determination and interest persisted; and it
                    is in fact true that I have never wanted to be anything other than a Foreign
                    Service officer. That made life much easier than it otherwise might have been as
                    a student because, among my schoolmates, I always had a clear fix on what I
                    wanted at a time when most of them were floundering around and had an interest,
                    you might say the opposite of mine, to make money. I wanted to be in the Foreign
                    Service, and have been very lucky in that sense to have had a career that has
                    spanned forty-two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated from the University of Tennessee when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: In December of 1948, then came to Washington and enrolled in George
                    Washington University to fill in a lot of gaps that I knew I had in my
                    education. I went to school at night and got a job working as a researcher,
                    which was a file clerk of sorts, in the Passport Division in the Winder (?)
                    building. Though there is no plaque on it today, it was in fact the Union Army
                    headquarters during the Civil War. I guess when I worked there in 1949 it still
                    bore some resemblance to the building of that time. It was the end of the
                    telegraph line and was where Lincoln used to go to read the incoming messages.
                    That made it fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the atmosphere there at that time? Ruth Shipley
                        was very much in command.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: One hundred and fifty percent in charge of not just the Passport
                    Division but of passports. She determined to a large degree who got passports
                    and who didn't. Passports were not automatic because there was a fairly
                    substantial network of legislation that determined who could not have passports.
                    And, of course, nationality was rather complicated too, depending on the number
                    of years, if you were an immigrant, you had spent in your country of origin, and
                    so forth. Then you had people surreptitiously going to Israel to serve in what
                    is today the Israeli armed forces but was then Palestine, and British. You had
                    people whose presence abroad was undesirable for one reason or another. She
                    could rule on all those things, subject to appeal, of course, but her rule was
                    rather firm. I, needless to say, was not a party to any of those high level
                    decisions. I was a clerk and I dutifully went down and got old files out of the
                    passport files and attached them to new applications and delivered them to the
                    examiners.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was told that it was sort of a rat infested cellar down
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: The rats only came out in the night time; I worked in the day time and
                    went to school at night studying commercial law, American diplomatic history and
                    international economics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did stay doing that before you moved on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Only one semester. In the summer of 1949 I was offered a job as a clerk.
                    Foreign Service Clerk was my title and I was sent off to Basra, Iraq.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation like in Basra in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Basra was a remote and exotic city, the seaport of Iraq, on the fringes
                    of a region that was coming to life in the petroleum business—lots of
                    exploration going on. It was a date growing regional center, in many ways very
                    traditional, very Shia, and very interesting. Our consular district included not
                    just southern Iraq but the Sheikhdom of Kuwait, and, informally for emergency
                    consular services, southern Iran as well. We had six Americans in the consulate
                    and we had a Chris Craft cabin cruiser that we used not only for recreational
                    purposes but to carry pouches and things down to ships that would take them back
                    to the United States. If the city was remote and exotic, the consulate was also
                    remote, and exotic in the sense that we lived and worked in an old Turkish
                    palace. The offices were downstairs and the male members of the consular staff
                    had a mess upstairs that included the principal officer, the two vice-consuls
                    and me, with one of whom I shared a room—something unthinkable today.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the principal officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Clifton P. English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was John Jova there at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: John Jova had gone; he left about a year before I got there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any problems with the Iraqis in those
                        days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Not many, and if there were, we in Basra were not involved in them. We
                    were a consular and economic reporting post; we reported on date shipments, on
                    oil exploration activities in the entire area. There was no political activity
                    that I recall and I spent lots of hours doing our telegrams.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you using, basically the one-time pad
                        method?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: We used the OTP but we still had other forms; we had some old strips and
                    once in a while we would even use a code book because it was cheaper. Our
                    telegrams, by the way, would arrive in five letter groups written by hand from
                    the local telegraph office. We got a carbon copy so occasionally we would have
                    to go back to the post office and ask them to check and see what the particular
                    letter was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: I left in September of 1950, after scarcely a year, to come back to
                    Washington to participate in an intern program. The intern program, which was a
                    very good deal for people in my situation, was really oriented toward developing
                    senior civil service administrators for the Department of State. It was,
                    nonetheless, an extremely good experience even though I had no intention
                    whatsoever of going into the civil service. One of the great benefits for me was
                    that among our three rotating assignments I was assigned for three months to the
                    Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs, working as the staff assistant to Dean Rusk and
                    his one Deputy Assistant Secretary, Livingston Merchant. It was a fascinating
                    period and at the end of my year of internship I went back there, in the same
                    position, for another six months or so. It was the time when the Korean War was
                    going on and Dean Rusk was very closely involved with Dean Acheson, obviously
                    shared his confidence, spent a lot of time with him. And of course the
                    relationship between the department and the White House, the Secretary of State
                    and the President, was very special at that time. Dean Acheson was the Secretary
                    of State in every sense of the word and the Department of State ran the
                    political side of the Korean War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Dean Rusk? This was when he
                        was Assistant Secretary for Far Eastern Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: He was quick, he was articulate, he was a quick study, obviously. He was
                    also, as far as I was concerned, friendly— somewhat aloof given the nature of
                    his circumstances and mine—always pleasant. What impressed me was his intimate
                    relationship with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of State's intimate
                    relationship with the President. The most delicate aspects were delegated by
                    Acheson to Rusk; for example, the dismissal of General MacArthur. It was obvious
                    that there was trouble in that area from the number of remarks that either Rusk
                    or Merchant made, and then he began to spend an increasing amount of time at
                    Blair House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: President Truman was living at Blair House at the
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: The White House was under reconstruction. One morning he came in and
                    handed me a letter, sealed, and told me to take it to National Airport and give
                    it to the Secretary of the Army, Frank Pace, who was leaving that morning. He
                    said, “Give it to no one but him; he will know what it is.” So I dutifully did
                    and realized later on that it was a letter of instructions to him for his
                    meeting with General MacArthur.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a very famous—the matter of timing became quite
                        an issue of history later on as far as Pace's mission to MacArthur.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: That letter was, I suppose, written by Rusk, signed by the Secretary and
                    given to Pace. Then followed another speech, an interview, and Rusk disappeared
                    one afternoon and stayed at a long meeting at Blair House until two or three
                    o'clock in the morning as I recall. Then he came in in the morning with his
                    briefcase, put it in the top drawer of his safe and announced to everybody in
                    the room, “This is out of bounds.” Obviously the decision had been made and they
                    were in the process of formulating it. The decision was announced, I think, that
                    night—the following night—and there was a good deal of turmoil and excitement in
                    the Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs, as you might imagine. My association with it
                    was, you might say, one of distant and amazed observation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling of the people in the Far Eastern
                        Bureau, as you saw it as the “fly on the wall”, dealing with MacArthur?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: That, as I recall, he was less and less responsive to his orders. That,
                    for whatever reason, personal ambition or a totally different concept of how the
                    military operation should be run, he was giving it more and more of his imprint.
                    I recall distinctly people feeling that it was getting dangerous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Livingston Merchant was a major player at that time but
                        even more so in the Dulles period. How did you find Livingston Merchant in
                        working with him and seeing him in operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: He was, as I said, the sole deputy, which is amusing today when we think
                    of an Assistant Secretary with five deputies. He was the Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary. He did all the things that Rusk was not personally involved in, was
                    an able second, was much more available to us, we dealt more with him. He was
                    always, no matter how preoccupied, available and I never hesitated to go in and
                    ask him questions, and he always had time to answer—something I would have never
                    dared do with Dean Rusk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To get a little feel for the attitude of the Department,
                        did the entrance of China into the Korean War come as a sudden shock or was
                        it becoming more and more apparent? What was the feeling toward China that
                        you were absorbing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Great preoccupation, great preoccupation. I think one of the problems
                    with MacArthur was the feeling that he was going to provoke them even more so,
                    he was proposing the use of nuclear weapons and things like that. Then they had
                    the Chinese onslaughts across the Yalu.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in the winter of 1950-1951.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: Yes. Also during that period we began to move toward a peace treaty with
                    Japan. That was given to John Foster Dulles, a distinguished Republican, who had
                    a very, very small staff. Obviously one of the hopes was to end the Japanese
                    problem in order to concentrate more on Korea and to deal with that in a
                    positive way. John Foster Dulles and his sole aide, John Allison, then began to
                    work separately on the Japanese Peace Treaty; did all the work themselves. I
                    remember, apropos of China—this would be about the summer of 1951—there came a
                    long telegram addressed to the President from Mao Zedong. Most unusual; I think
                    the only one we ever received from him; it came over international telex. The
                    first question was whether we should even receive it. The answer to that was
                    that we already had it. We sent it to the President and he sent it back to
                    Acheson who sent it down to Rusk with a lot of annotations on it, the only one
                    of which I remember was various notations of “mousy dung”, exclamation point,
                    from the President. China was a pariah, obviously, and a pariah that caused us
                    enormous concern.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I should add that one Saturday morning in the middle of that summer of
                    1951, Dean Rusk came in and figuratively, if not physically, took me by the
                    scruff of the neck and said, “Come with me.” I really had no idea why. Out we
                    went and down the corridor and he said, “I am taking you down to see Foster
                    Dulles.” This was all new to me; we went into the suite where Dulles was
                    working, in the outer room sat his secretary, Bernita O'Day, in the inner room
                    was Dulles, across the hall and down a bit was John Allison. That was it as I
                    recall. We went in and Rusk said, “Foster, I have brought your new staff
                    assistant.” That was how I learned my relationship to Mr. Dulles. He said that
                    was fine and here's what I want, that sort of thing, as Rusk and I stood there.
                    As we went out, after that brief interview, he said, “Come on Monday.” His
                    secretary looked up at Rusk and said, “We don't need a staff assistant,” which
                    was a lovely way to begin. But we later became great friends and she was
                    extremely helpful to me. I worked in there with him for about four months.
                    Actually that Saturday was the day the Russians announced they would attend,
                    which changed the conference entirely.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: The four or five months that I was with him were not enough to develop a
                    personal relationship with him, especially with a personality like his which was
                    friendly but distant. Very difficult to get close to; there was no degree of
                    intimacy. I worked with him and did as he asked, the usual things staff
                    assistants do—screening papers, writing notes, errands. I had no substantive
                    role with him at all. As a personality he was very much one of the major figures
                    of the Department of State, certainly in his own opinion. In fact, he made more
                    than the Secretary of State as I recall.</p>

                    reputation of being irascible, mercurial, and very difficult. He was an
                    intellectual, a collector of first editions; in fact had a lively sense of humor
                    and was a very interesting person. After the election I moved...</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: It couldn't have been. I guess Rusk left—yes, Rusk left and went to be
                    President of the Rockefeller Foundation, there was no election. Dulles left the
                    Department shortly after the treaty was signed in San Francisco; Allison became
                    Assistant Secretary and I went back to the Bureau and worked for him for a while
                    and found him prickly and irascible. But I didn't stay very long, about a month
                    later I left to go to Japan. It wasn't until later when I worked for him, a
                    prospect I faced with a good deal of trepidation, that my opinion changed and I
                    realized indeed that he was not only very competent but a person of great
                    intellectual depth, an excellent writer and had a very good sense of humor.</p>

                    morning when Rusk said, “Come with me.” I was an FSS-13, earning the princely

                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: No, as a staff officer to the administrative officer. This was when my
                    FSS-12, which was only one rank above the clerical bottom, came into play. I
                    went there as sort of a special assistant to the administrative officer because
                    we were changing—the peace treaty was signed and would come into effect on April
                    29, I think—from the diplomatic section of SCAP (Supreme Commander Allied
                    Powers—General MacArthur most of the time, by that time it was General Ridgway)
                    to an Embassy. Japan was going to cease being an occupied country and become an
                    independent country. We were building up the Embassy in anticipation of that
                    changeover and I went out to be administrative assistant to the administrative
                    officer. Which was fun; it was a very good place because we had a big
                    administrative section and a high powered administrative officer and indeed I
                    was his executive assistant. I don't know what we would call that today,
                    probably it doesn't exist, we are not rich enough for it anymore. The new
                    Ambassador announced was Robert Murphy, who was due to arrive on April 29th, the
                    very day of the changeover. We had in that diplomatic section the protocol
                    office which handled the commanding general's relations with all the Embassies
                    which more or less came under him, at least theoretically.</p>
                <p>One evening, I think the day the Ambassador arrived, there was a welcoming
                    reception for him, by us, by the staff, and I remember vividly standing up there
                    minding my own business, quietly, unobtrusively, as was appropriate to my
                    station, when the personnel officer came over to me and said, “I suppose you
                    know that you are going to be the new Ambassador's protocol officer?” Again
                    lightning had struck; I was stunned, I was terrified. I didn't think that was a
                    great thing at all, I knew nothing about it. This was because the protocol
                    officer who had been in the diplomatic section before was leaving; he was a
                    master, he knew everything, everybody, and I was to take his place! And, of
                    course, Robert Murphy was an intimidating individual; he came there with his
                    record of association with Harold Macmillan and Dwight Eisenhower and Mark Clark
                    during the Second World War; he had been Ambassador to Belgium and he was a kind
                    of diplomat of a type that you see very rarely now. I don't want to sound
                    nostalgic, but his concept of the United States was embodied in him as an
                    Ambassador and he represented the President of the United States and the United
                    States in the broadest and strongest sense. I realize now that the reason he was
                    sent there, given his strong personality—I guess his Irish temper—and his
                    military background, was to make the transition. To see that Japan emerged from
                    occupation and that the military role in the day to day life was changed
                    dramatically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about the American military which had been
                        ruling very nicely and happily for quite a while; to suddenly become
                        subservient to an Embassy would be a major problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: It was difficult. Mark Clark came out as the new commander and at that
                    time, of course, the Korean War was going on and the United Nations Command was
                    located in Tokyo. The Supreme Command remained in Tokyo, the far east air force
                    remained out at Haneda Airport, the navy was in ..?.. So they had a genuine
                    problem of schizophrenia themselves; by and large they tried, but of course
                    under the previous regime Embassy personnel had been military. We were all given
                    ranks. When I arrived I was taken to the Iesu Hotel, a company grade billet,
                    where I shared a hotel room with four other people—two permanent and two
                    temporary beds for people who came over on R&amp;R from Korea. It was a wild
                    existence and it wasn't all surprising to see in our common bathrooms little
                    Japanese girls coming and going and taking their showers too. It was an
                    interesting time. Places were still off limits, there were things that civilian
                    employees of the military could not do. But of course that no longer applied to
                    us and one of the problems was asserting our individual independence vis-a-vis
                    the military—we were no longer under MP's, for example. It was a time of
                    transition, from great things like the role of the Prime Minister to little
                    things about who gives traffic tickets. And Murphy, I am sure, was sent there to
                    effect that transition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a protocol officer did you have much contact with
                        Murphy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Oh, constant; I moved up into his office. I was today what we would call
                    a staff aide and that meant I had an intimate relationship with him. I was also
                    an ADC, I traveled every place with him. We didn't get all that many visitors to
                    the Embassy and I was sort of the permanent control officer for all
                    Congressional delegations. I did all of his guest lists, his seating charts and
                    things like that. I had all the relations with the Foreign Minister's office,
                    the Prime Minister's office, and the Imperial Household. If he wanted to see the
                    Emperor, for example, which wasn't very often, or if he wanted to take a
                    distinguished visitor like Adlai Stevenson over to see him—which he really
                    didn't want to do all that much but he knew he should—I would call and make the
                    arrangements with my contact, Baron Matsui, I think it was, in the Imperial
                    Household. A lovely man. We would say things like, “The Ambassador is wondering
                    whether His Imperial Majesty might receive Mr. So-and-so.” We would get a
                    telegram of instructions requesting that, and I would say, “Of course if it is
                    not convenient we would understand,” and it would never happen. Or we might say,
                    “We hope it might be possible,” and he would work it in. Obviously I wasn't
                    making these things up, they were all on Murphy's guidance.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>I remember one issue that came up which emphasizes Murphy's role. Some months
                    after the end of the occupation the American Army in effect kidnaped a Japanese
                    national. A very mysterious business, I am not really sure what the ins and outs
                    were; he had a clandestine relationship, was involved in things he shouldn't
                    have been doing; I think he was probably a double agent. Anyhow, they kidnaped
                    him and there was a great stew in the press about what has happened to
                    So-and-so. Nobody knew. Finally it turned out that we had him and had been
                    holding him all this time. Murphy summoned, summoned the chief of staff, a three
                    star general, and explained to him in terms we could hear in the outer office
                    why that was not possible, why it was a stupid thing to do. Of course the
                    general knew it. Murphy's relationship with Clark was a factor but also his own
                    concept of the United States and the way it does things, how you effect a
                    transition from an occupied country to a free country that is going to be
                    extremely important to us. This was an example of the kind of thing that he
                    did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Murphy had been the American consul general in
                        Algiers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: He was political advisor in that capacity and then he went with Clark
                    through Italy as his political advisor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had also met Clark in Algiers in a clandestine meeting.
                        Clark came by submarine before the landings. So they had a long
                        relationship. As protocol officer did you find yourself trying to hold back,
                        trying to keep the Embassy from leaning too hard on the Japanese so as to
                        get them back in the mainstream, not subservient as before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: We treated them with complete normality from our standpoint. Murphy knew
                    how to play the game. The Japanese certainly knew how to play the game of
                    diplomacy. We observed all the forms, all the proprieties and carried on a
                    regular day to day business with them at all levels. Murphy played golf with the
                    Foreign Minister, Okasaki, usually once a week. He spent a lot of time with the
                    Prime Minister, Yoshida. The Embassy was developing its own contacts throughout
                    the government, working relations and things like that, in a very normal way.
                    And looking back on it now I realize that this was the way it was done. One of
                    the problems I mentioned was the legitimate difficulty of the military,
                    psychologically, to readjust. They did. I think they did it, certainly at the
                    top, with total good faith and good will. But it was difficult because they were
                    still a very senior command fighting a war next door. There were some problems
                    from the business community, many of whom had lived in China, many of whom had
                    moved to Japan and prospered under the occupation and found it difficult to
                    adjust suddenly to the Japanese way of doing things. Some did, some didn't;
                    those who didn't used to act in ways that showed they wished things had not
                    changed; there was a carpetbagger mentality on their part.</p>

                        then all of a sudden I found myself part of a defense ally as it reverted to
                        a normal relationship. I could see that it was difficult for some of the

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I took my exams in Tokyo in 1952.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was the old three and a half day exam and then you went
                        back to take your orals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I hitched a ride with an Assistant Secretary of State, Walter Robertson,
                    who had been out to see Syngman Rhee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any chance at all to talk to him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was, I am told, a courteous southern gentleman and at
                        the same time Mr.”don't mess with China” personified.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: My relationship was more or less limited to that flight, at least my
                    initial relationship. He was a very courteous Richmond gentleman, as you say. We
                    had a lot of fun on the way back; he was very relaxed and I was hitching a free
                    ride since at that time there was no other way to take the examination except to
                    go back to Washington and do it. And I was here when the Armistice was
                    announced.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your oral examination like? You took it in

                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: In July of 1953. It lasted about an hour and a half; there were, I
                    think, five people, one from the Department of Commerce, the others from the
                    Department of State, none of whom I knew. It was initially personal and then we
                    got on to my academic activities, which in high school were terrible and they
                    knew it. They asked me questions about why I had done so poorly in this subject
                    and that subject. I said that except for English literature where I had an
                    acknowledged weakness, I didn't regret it because I had made up for it in
                    college. They smiled and that was very reassuring. Then we talked about the
                    Foreign Service and the implementation of policy. “Did I think the regional high
                    commissioner was a good idea?” That had been discussed in the Ambassador's staff
                    meeting and I had an answer already to go. “What did I think about personnel
                    administration?” That had been discussed in the Ambassador's staff meeting. I
                    had all kinds of information and that helped a lot. Someone had told me in the
                    Embassy, “Make them smile, make them laugh.” It turned out very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your career progress here? You went back to
                        Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I went back to Japan, back to my job with, by then, Ambassador Allison
                    and stayed another year with him in the same role I had had with Murphy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find a difference between Murphy and Allison as
                        far as dealing with the Japanese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Allison was perforce much closer to them; he had been in Japan before
                    the war, he spoke Japanese and he had been interned by them. So he had a much
                    more personal interest in developing relations with Japan and used to get very
                    upset with people who made his life complicated. I never saw that very much with
                    Murphy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you came back to Washington, to the Department for a

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I came back to Washington in the late summer of 1954 and went into a
                    Southeast Asia language and area program at the Georgetown Institute of
                    Languages and Linguistics on Massachusetts Avenue, that I guess no longer
                    exists, and spent about seven months studying Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Dien Bien Phu time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Dien Bien Phu was earlier, when I was in the Bureau. This was after the
                    Geneva Conference of 1955, when the French in effect pulled out and divided the
                    country at the 17th parallel.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So did you have a choice in the matter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I had a choice. I certainly didn't want to go into a strictly Vietnamese
                    language program; there was no one else, I was to be the first. Having been in
                    Japan where we had an extensive and extremely good language program, the idea
                    was interesting; moreover, it was a way to get out of administrative and get
                    into political. So it was explained by the Dean over there that this was an area
                    program that encompassed at least two languages and the whole area from Burma
                    and Indonesia through Indochina, and no one had done it yet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were the first Vietnamese language officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't imagine at the time that you thought you might be
                        the beginning of a whole wave of people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: No. It was fun; I had about six months here and then another three
                    months on my own in Saigon. The way the language students had done it in
                    Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said two languages. What was the other one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: The other one that was offered later on and declined on my behalf before
                    I knew it, was Thai.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the language?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Extremely difficult. We spent our first thirty days or six weeks doing
                    nothing but singing tones, there were three of us in the class. And we sang
                    tones with our southern instructors, that is all, the first month before we put
                    anything together. The vowels are as difficult as the tones. You have to develop
                    a totally different way of thinking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I took just about two weeks of Vietnamese as an
                        introduction and I found it absolutely impossible. I couldn't tell the
                        difference between words with different tones.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: We transmit emotions by tones, they transmit meanings.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could we talk a little about your activities as a trainee
                        and the situation in Saigon when you arrived there as a trainee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: My wife and I arrived in Saigon on double ten, 1955, after a
                    twenty-three day ship trip from the United States. This was after the Geneva
                    Conference. In any case, South Vietnam, the Republic of Vietnam, was a new
                    country and I was in a new field. As for the language study aspects, I tried to
                    follow the pattern I had seen in Japan for the language students there. There
                    was an organized school and an organized program. We had neither in Saigon, but
                    I had no duties in the Embassy. It was understood that I would not work in the
                    Embassy. I had money for tutors; the USIS people helped me find some, I
                    interviewed them and established a regular regime of classes with tutors and
                    then spent a number of hours each week on my own, wandering around in Saigon
                    and, whenever I chose, outside. It was a quiet period, probably the beginning of
                    the best period in Vietnam's life. Someone once referred to it as the golden
                    age; anyway you could do anything you wanted, go anyplace by any means. They had
                    public transportation, trains down to the south. I took a train once down to Can
                    Tho, found a place to stay, wandered around town, struck up a conversation with
                    some army officers. This was the sort of thing I thought one was to do, wander
                    around Saigon. It was fun and added to that was the regular course of studies
                    with my tutors, both spoken and written. That lasted about two months and then
                    the Ambassador asked if we would like to take up residence in his house in Da
                    Lat, which was up in the highlands.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of the Switzerland of Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Exactly. And during the period of Bao Dai, the Emperor, that was his
                    summer capital. The United States owned up there a large, Charles Adams type,
                    Victorian mansion on a hillside.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: Frederick Reinhardt, Fritz Reinhardt. Since he and his family wanted to
                    go up for Christmas, they wanted someone to go up and get the house not so much
                    cleaned as organized. There was a permanent staff of servants and there were all
                    kinds of problems. Needless to say we said we would do that service and off we
                    went. The missionaries helped me find some tutors and I reembarked on a program
                    of regular study, in very pleasant circumstances. All that time in Saigon my
                    wife and I had been living in Room 333 at the Majestic Hotel. At the end of that
                    three months of formal study, we applied for and were authorized to take a
                    regional study tour. So we went off, the two of us, to Singapore, up through
                    Singapore to Malacca, Bangkok and back. Shortly after we arrived back the
                    Department sent me off to be an observer to a university sponsored regional
                    studies program in Rangoon. That was the extent of my studies program. I started
                    to work in the Embassy in January, 1956.</p>
                <p>The situation in Vietnam: it was the dawn of a new era for us; there was real
                    enthusiasm of various kinds. The country was in the process of creating its new
                    institutions; it was writing a constitution, it was creating a parliament, it
                    was preparing to elect a chief of state. We were optimistic, enthusiastic. We
                    were convinced the country had economic potential if we could develop the rice
                    export industry. Needless to say, underlying it all, was the fact that we were
                    the non-colonialists. The French had tried to deal with the country as a colony
                    and had harvested the inevitable fruits—failure, disgrace. We were democrats, we
                    were going to show this country; we were going to teach this country democracy,
                    one way or another we were going to teach it democracy; it was going to be
                    democratic and it was going to be a success. It was a period of that kind of
                    attitude. It was genuine; we really thought we had a chance of turning this
                    little country into a prosperous democracy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing at the Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I moved into the Embassy as the junior officer in the political section,
                    the only one who could speak or read or write Vietnamese. I was sort of given
                    political grunt work. We got a copy of the constitution and I translated it. I
                    read the newspapers and did a little press summary for the Ambassador every
                    morning. I would get out and talk to people. One of the first things I wrote was
                    a series of dispatches on the developing election campaign. That sort of
                    thing—basic political reporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much interest was there back in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I personally never got any feedback, but I got a lot of encouragement
                    from my bosses. The Ambassador, a professional, his deputy and the head of the
                    political section and his deputy were all very supportive and encouraging.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Fritz Reinhardt was the Ambassador, Dan Anderson was the Deputy Chief of
                    Mission, Frank Malloy was the head of the political section and his deputy was
                    John McKesson. Anything I wanted to do they thought was fine, they would be glad
                    to have. They would steer me, give me guidance which I badly needed. John
                    McKesson, in particular, was an outstanding writer; he had a very graceful
                    flowing style, could accomplish a lot with few words; he was a profound and
                    beneficial influence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our view of the government? Diem was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Diem was to be the hero. I am sure the Ambassador had no illusions about
                    problems and attitudes, things like that, but we were optimistic. I remember in
                    particular, because it was published the other day, writing a dispatch about the
                    electoral setup, how I was convinced that it was heavily rigged, heavily loaded
                    in every way, institutionally, legally, etc., in favor of the chosen parties and
                    individuals, and said so. I remember having to be careful about how I said it.
                    The Ambassador, all the people I mentioned, did not impose any kind of
                    censorship, but on the other hand they had their instructions and they didn't
                    want to sow discouragement. So I had to be careful about how I wrote this
                    particular dispatch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the timing? Was Magsaysay of the Philippines
                        going strong or had he recently died? I was wondering if there was a
                        correlation between these events?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I think he was dead by then but there was a correlation in more ways
                    than you realize. We had with us General Lansdale who considered that he had
                    made Magsaysay. General Lansdale was very present and had his own little
                    operation, I guess. Even to this day I am not sure what it was; had with him a
                    number of scholars and academicians and people like that. I remember one Sunday
                    my wife and I invited to go with us on a picnic that the Vietnamese-American
                    Association had organized a Filipino jurist who was living in the hotel. He was
                    working on the constitution and we had become friendly with him, so we invited
                    him to go and off we went. The following week, I don't remember the details, I
                    was told that General Lansdale didn't like the fact that I had invited Judge
                    So-and-so to go off with us and would I please not pursue that relationship. My
                    attitude toward that was that General Lansdale can do his thing and what I do
                    socially is my business. That is the way it was left.</p>

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: In retrospect I suppose he was trying to make Diem like Magsaysay, make
                    him honest and develop him and get him all kinds of apparatus to extend his
                    authority in the right kind of way. I guess, I am not sure. Yes, General
                    Lansdale's operation was viewed with something close to distaste because he
                    wanted to be alone, he wanted his autonomy to do whatever he wanted to do—I
                    suppose the way he operated in the Philippines. They were plugged into the
                    station, but how we were not quite sure. I didn't really care.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By station you mean the CIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Yes, the CIA station.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there the feeling at the time, that there were wheels
                        within wheels; that we were encouraged by the way Vietnam was going but at
                        the same time we were developing a client state?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: That came a little bit later; certainly if there was sensitivity to it
                    it was not viewed as a concern. It might even go so far as to say that a client
                    state would insure its success. You had General Lansdale's operation; you had
                    Michigan State University which was there under contract to AID and also helping
                    them to write a constitution, civil institutions, under a man named Dr. Fishel.
                    They had their own way of doing things, they were less—I don't want to use the
                    word estranged—distant from the Embassy, but they had their separate operation.
                    So you had Lansdale's operation, this particular operation and a large and
                    growing USOM operations mission, and a small military assistance advisory
                    group—it was small, limited by the terms of the Geneva accords.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fifty-five observers, or something. I guess I don't know
                        how many.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I forget the number, could it have been three hundred? Under General
                    O'Daniel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any insurgency going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: At that time, no. The central authority in Saigon was principally
                    concerned with establishing its writ throughout South Vietnam, and in the first
                    instance that meant against Bao Dai, the Emperor, resident in France but wanting
                    to come back. There was a plebiscite shortly after we arrived as a result of
                    which he ceased to be a factor. It was obviously heavily rigged, but be that as
                    it may. Then you had some insurgencies, local South Vietnamese warlords who had
                    probably been encouraged and tolerated by the French, who wanted to maintain
                    their fiefdoms, including armed fiefdoms—the right to stop traffic on the road
                    and collect tolls and things like that. There were, I think, two of those which
                    had to be put down, and were. Everybody thought putting them down was a good
                    thing; we talked about our Shay's Rebellion and the Whiskey Rebellion. Then came
                    the extension of civil institutions and authority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the French? Did they play dog in the
                        manger?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: No, the French moved out, probably happily. The last troops, the Foreign
                    Legion, departed in April of 1956, departed proudly. I do not recall any of that
                    on the part of the French. There was a French Embassy and a French Ambassador
                    and I am sure that there must have been a good deal more than I saw, but I do
                    not recall any French interference from then on. They were probably delighted to
                    be out of the place, this was the Fourth Republic in France and it was well shed
                    of Indochina. But nonetheless, as I mentioned, you had the signs of
                    authoritarianism in the electoral laws, you saw it in the constitution, which I
                    remember because I told you I translated the first version we got. Everything
                    was hedged by “in accordance with the law.” “There shall be complete freedom of
                    the press, in accordance with the law.” Everything had that qualification with
                    it. We wrestled a lot of the time with the concept of “personalism,” which was a
                    mystical, Catholic origin, Buddhist influenced philosophy of the President's
                    brother. No one was quite sure what it meant but it became the official
                    ideology. Then there was the President's sister who was a pain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Madame Nhu. She was the wife of the President's
                        brother.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I beg your pardon, the President's sister-in-law. A pain, but not a
                    major factor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the President's brother?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: That was Nhu; another brother lived up in Hue, was a mandarin, a
                    regional autocrat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The real problem later was the President's brother and
                        sister-in-law. How did we see them at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: As pests. Troublesome, interfering. We didn't realize at first the
                    enormity of the problem that they were to become. Both of them were seen as
                    unhelpful influences. Diem himself was very difficult to deal with, for one
                    thing he was so garrulous. He would talk and talk and talk; every American
                    visitor who went there got a lecture of some kind. I know the Ambassador would
                    go for long meetings with him and come back and try to piece out what it was
                    that he had actually accomplished. I went to take notes once with a Senatorial
                    delegation. I wrote pages and pages and pages of notes and when it came time to
                    do the memcon I had to completely rearrange the meeting to make any sense out of
                    it. I think everyone had that problem with him. Secondly, he was not honest with
                    us. Whether he would lie, I don't know, but certainly he would conceal, not
                    deliver, have his ministries hold back information. People in the government
                    told us many things that were simply not true, knowing they were not true; it
                    was much easier to tell us something good that was not true than something bad
                    that was. And they didn't like us prying, trying to find out what was going
                    on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about corruption?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Corruption certainly was endemic. We were perhaps less sensitive to it
                    at the very beginning than we became later on. There were many, many rumors of
                    corruption and so we were all convinced it was there, but it was more, at first
                    at least, intellectual corruption, philosophical corruption. The Nhus were
                    obviously getting money though I don't think we were able to identify how. By
                    philosophical and intellectual corruption I mean l'�tat, c'est moi; whatever is
                    good for the country me is good for me, whatever is good for me is good for the
                    country; whatever I do is ipso facto beneficial. That is, of course, what led to
                    awful corruption later on in all forms because it spread down to all levels of
                    government. But that came later on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about our view of events in North Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I think you could say that we had no illusions as to what was going on
                    in North Vietnam, the only illusion we had was that they would respect the
                    Geneva agreement. Illusion and hope; they said they would, they said they were.
                    Of course we know they never had any intention of doing so. As far as what they
                    were doing in Hanoi it was obvious. There was also the institution of the ICC,
                    the International Control Commission, which was the treaty supervision body
                    established by the Geneva accords with an Indian chairman, a Polish component
                    and a Canadian component. They became my reporting responsibility later on so I
                    spent a lot of time with them as well as with the Vietnamese who were in liaison
                    with them. The Canadians would tell us, and some of the Indians, about what was
                    happening in North Vietnam. There was no question of what they were doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We may then move on to your next assignment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Well, technically my next assignment was in Hue. My wife and I drove up
                    there in the summer of 1957 and opened a consulate. Birth pains at the end of
                    the line in the truest sense. We opened a little consulate; I had one
                    administrative assistant, there was also a USIS cultural center with an American
                    and his wife, sixteen MAAG officers, Military Assistance and Advisory Group, and
                    an American nurse supplied by the Economic Assistance Program. It was a very
                    interesting year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you? On the Perfume River?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Oh yes. Again, at that time there were no restrictions on what you could
                    do or where you could go. There was a French consul in what was still called
                    Tourainne whom we knew quite well and we used to drive down and have dinner with
                    them, or take the train down, have dinner with them and drive back at night. We
                    could go hunting, which we did from time to time, at night—walk all night
                    through the hills. Then I went on a trip with a couple of MAAG officers up into
                    the plateau, on foot and dugout; up the river, almost to the Lao border and back
                    through the valleys and down again. I was gone almost a week. Life in Hue was
                    very different from life in Saigon and I did a lot more writing of basic things
                    about what was going on up there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a difference? Here was Hue, the former capital
                        of united Vietnam; was there a different political atmosphere? Also, how was
                        Diem's presence in Saigon impacting on this part of the country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: A different psychological and cultural atmosphere. Diem was from Hue,
                    his mother lived there when we arrived. His brother lived there; his brother was
                    the local mandarin, and mandarin in the very classic Chinese sense almost;
                    unmarried, shy, retiring, said to be an intellectual, who ran that part of the
                    country, which was central Vietnam, absolutely. It was his fief, it really was.
                    He controlled the entire government authority up there. There is a contradiction
                    in being shy and reclusive and hard to see and running everything, but he did.
                    His power was unseen but very present; of course it was derived from his
                    brother. Hue was referred to as the ancient capital of Vietnam; ancient means
                    the beginning of the nineteenth century. The oldest building up there isn't as
                    old as the White House. But it was the traditional capital for about a hundred
                    years. It is modeled on Peking, they even have the inner part called the “Great
                    Within” as in Peking; the royal palace, the forbidden part, etc. It still saw
                    itself as the repository of Vietnamese culture. The accent is different, the
                    food is different, the attitudes are much more intellectual and detached, there
                    are more monasteries around Hue, the royal tombs are up there. We were closer to
                    Hanoi than we were to Saigon.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the relation of the Vietnamese there with the
                        Montagnards? Later we recruited the Montagnards in large numbers but there
                        always seemed to be this problem between them and the plains dwellers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: The Vietnamese certainly, I don't know if oppressed them is the right
                    term, exploited them. As the highlands became targets of development and
                    exploitation and the Vietnamese moved up there voluntarily they began to
                    conflict with the Montagnards whose lands they were. The Montagnards were much
                    happier with us, I think, than with the Vietnamese who were very aggressive.
                    Sihanouk used to say that if there had been no French in the middle of the
                    nineteenth century there would be no Cambodia. Yes, there were conflicts and the
                    Vietnamese in their cultural arrogance looked down on them and exploited them
                    and ordered them around. I remember once we were spending the night in a
                    Montagnard village and as we were sitting around I noticed a picture of Diem up
                    on the wall. I asked our host, “Who is that man?” He said, “I don't know.” There
                    was a Vietnamese with us who got very exercised and said, “Yes you do know who
                    that is.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever get to see Diem's brother?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Yes, I had one meeting with him shortly before I left, unfortunately; I
                    hadn't wanted to press him but use it as a social occasion to build upon later.
                    I think I was the only American who ever saw him. We had a nice social chat
                    about general problems up there and about American aid, he had some pet projects
                    he hoped we would help him with. He had some criticisms of American aid which,
                    as I recall, were factually incorrect and improperly premised. Just a few days
                    before we were leaving we were being inspected and I had the inspector in my
                    office and there came some messengers from the “councilor,” as he was called. In
                    they came with a pole over their head with an enormous gaur head. A gaur is a
                    wild cow, I think, a jungle cow, an enormous beast. Here was the stuffed head of
                    this gaur slung on the pole. That was my farewell present from the
                    councilor.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: We were a listening post to extend the reportorial reach of the Embassy,
                    which we did. I remember one day sitting in my office wondering what I would do
                    with my time that day. I said to myself, “I know.” I got in my car and drove
                    down to the lagoon, it was a kind of estuary, hired a boat and went across to
                    the other side and spent the day walking around through a couple of villages
                    there. Then went back and wrote what I thought was a wonderful report on what
                    life was like over there, what people were talking about and how the economy was
                    functioning or not functioning.</p>

                <p>BARBOUR: Yes. That was Quang Tri province; in fact we ended our hike, our walking
                    tour, right along the DMZ in Quang Tri. Went up there several times but could
                    never go in; I used to go up and see the province chief from time to time, went
                    up to see some maneuvers a couple of times, paid visits. It was routinely
                    covered from the consulate. We would go up and have dinner with the ICC from
                    time to time.</p>

                <p>BARBOUR: There was no cross-border movement to speak of, except for the ICC. It
                    was virtually impossible, except for a small number of farmers, to move back and
                    forth.</p>

                <p>BARBOUR: I was the Far Eastern fellow, which meant Indochina; although it had
                    shifted by that time and became largely Laos where we had our alarms and
                    discouraging leaks. From time to time I used to see Souvanna Phouma who was then
                    in exile in Paris with his wife. I was the liaison with the Quai d'Orsay on
                    Indochina; later that was expanded into black Africa. It was the period of de
                    Gaulle; we arrived with the Fifth Republic and it was the beginning of African
                    independence, in French Africa, at least. It was a very interesting time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, a fascinating time. What about the Laotian thing; what
                        was happening there and what was the French-American connection in that
                        regard?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: If the French didn't have much interest in Vietnam, they retained a lot
                    of interest in Laos and wanted very much to be informed and involved, and were.
                    It was not mainstream Embassy work, which from my standpoint made it much more
                    fun because the fellow doing that job had a lot of autonomy. He would decide
                    whom to go and see, when to write it up, give his telegrams to the boss who
                    would sign them and off they would go. There was a sense of communicating
                    directly with the Department on those issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that your master was really the Far Eastern
                        Bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: Yes, first Far East and then African. French external preoccupations at
                    that time were really in North Africa, meaning basically Algeria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you had black Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I had black Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: De Gaulle came in at that time; this was a return from the
                        wilderness to put order into things. From your viewpoint what was the

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: We had a very distinguished gentleman as Ambassador, Amory Houghton, a
                    gentleman in the truest sense, who spoke no French and who rarely, practically
                    never, saw General de Gaulle...</p>
                <p>(Interruption on tape.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have just moved shop here. You mentioned, going back to
                        our previous talk about Vietnam, insurrections...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: They did begin to develop in Vietnam; in 1957, I think. There was one
                    notable incident in which the Viet Cong, as they were called, captured and
                    murdered the head of the ICC liaison mission, Colonel ..?.. So there were
                    reports that bands would infiltrate and leave, and of incidents in the
                    countryside, but it was not a problem, it did not hinder movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then back to your time in Paris. How was the return of de
                        Gaulle seen in the Embassy? De Gaulle had been sort of a thorn in our side
                        in World War II and right afterward.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Our feelings were, as you say, somewhat ambivalent as he was a very
                    difficult person. And Amory Houghton practically never saw him; had seen him
                    only once in his days in his tent and very rarely afterwards. We did, however,
                    have a very good relationship through Cecil Lyon, the DCM, with the Prime
                    Minister, Michel Debr�; they got along splendidly and saw a good deal of each
                    other. But attitudes towards de Gaulle were ambivalent. On the one hand there
                    was the personal and personality side, which was very much present on our
                    minds... (phone interruption).</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were talking about de Gaulle. Cecil Lyons was really
                        the man, at that time, wouldn't you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: He was the man for most senior level dealings with the French
                    government, but that did not go up to de Gaulle, whom we did not see very often.
                    The Ambassador saw the Foreign Minister, who spoke excellent English, Couve de
                    Murville. Cecil Lyon dealt with people below that level and occasionally got
                    interested, I was happy to see, in things related to the Far East and black
                    Africa. But our attitude toward de Gaulle was colored by the ambivalence I
                    mentioned, on the personal side, the history of difficulty, and on the other
                    hand what he represented for France. What he represented for France at that time
                    we liked very much because France under the Fourth Republic was not much help to
                    anybody. What we wanted was a much stabler, more positive looking ally. That is
                    what de Gaulle offered, indeed brought; little did we realize that he would
                    throw us out some years later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Vernon Walters there as the Military Attach� at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: No, that was much later. He came twice with President Eisenhower as
                    Lieutenant Colonel Walters, the interpreter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let us talk then about black Africa. This was the period
                        when black Africa was coming into its own.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: The French were pretty well out of Indochina, although still interested
                    in Cambodia and Laos. Their remaining place in the world was in Africa, North
                    and sub-Saharan. They had given Morocco its independence and Tunisia its
                    independence while remaining in a fairly happy way there. Algeria was a
                    department of France—”from Dunkerque to Tamanrasset, it's all France, never to
                    be alienated.” But on November 1, 1954, the Algerian insurrection broke out, and
                    when I was there it was going full steam. Black Africa, then, represented, I
                    guess, a different kind of hope for them because the French had a longer history
                    in black Africa, they were deeply ensconced there and there was no sign of
                    political unrest or anti-French attitudes in their French territories. Shortly
                    after he took office, de Gaulle made a trip through French Africa and proclaimed
                    the Community, the constitution provides for the Community, in which the African
                    territories were to have a more or less independent relationship while still
                    dependent on France in certain ways. As he went through black Africa all the
                    African leaders signed on except one, S�kou Tour� of Guinea. In a speech in de
                    Gaulle's presence in Conakry, S�kou Tour� said his Guinea would have nothing to
                    do with the Community or any ties to France after that, it was one hundred
                    percent independence. So de Gaulle returned to France and said, “So be it,”;
                    Guinea was cut off. S�kou Tour� was a very pronounced leftist Marxist demagogue
                    anyway, and the French pulled out brutally, lock, stock and barrel. What they
                    couldn't take with them they dismantled; it was a brutal departure, intended, of
                    course, to indicate to the rest of the Africans what would be in store for them
                    if they didn't like the Community.</p>
                <p>So the Community had its day. I forget how long it lasted, but during the period
                    it lasted General de Gaulle was President of the Republic and of the Community,
                    and on July 14, in another two years, you had the President and the Chiefs of
                    State of the Community. There were a lot of nice perks in it for them, belong to
                    the community and you got your subsidies, you got this, you got that, all kinds
                    of good things. They made it worth while. But then in the fall of 1960, I
                    suppose, de Gaulle went to Dakar—the Senegalese had been restive—and made a
                    speech, a landmark speech, which put all the African states on notice that if
                    they wanted to be independent, they could be independent. He said, “Go, its
                    okay, go,” so they went. They all became independent; of course they are still
                    in many way dependent on France, but there are no institutional ties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any reflection of this from your contacts
                        in the Quai d'Orsay? Why did de Gaulle first say you are either in my
                        Community or out in the wilderness, then change to you can leave, we won't
                        be revengeful?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I think they considered they would maintain the form and let the
                    substance go. The implication, of course, was for Algeria which was the French
                    preoccupation at the time. If we let these states become independent then what
                    does that mean for Algeria. De Gaulle never said, I don't think, that Algeria
                    could never be independent but he gave that impression. So the African states
                    adopted a new identity and became less closely tied to French policies.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the French diplomats in the Quai d'Orsay deal with
                        you on these things? Did they think we might go fishing in their waters, or
                        anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: They were unquestionably ambivalent. On the one hand they thought, quite
                    rightly, that we could never supplant them because of the cultural ties, that we
                    would never really try for economic reasons. They were right on both scores. But
                    they hoped we would be mindful of French interests and I think to a large degree
                    we were. So I don't recall any acrimony or tension over black Africa, over Laos,
                    yes, but not over black Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the tension over Laos?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Various Laotian crises—SEATO, France was a member of SEATO—when it
                    looked as though we were going to get involved in a larger conflict in Laos and
                    the French didn't want to. Remember this was 1961, the beginning of the Kennedy
                    Administration, and there was a lot of muscle flexing and there were various
                    Laotian crises. One of these brought the Secretary and Selwyn Lloyd to Paris for
                    a ministerial meeting on Laos. Can you imagine such a thing today? There used to
                    be a fair number of these things. SEATO saber rattling. The French position was
                    that we were complicating the Laotian crisis and didn't really know what we were
                    doing. Their position was consistently that they understood what we Americans
                    were doing but thought we were wrong; and that was what they maintained. So we
                    had a lot of conversations with them on the subject of Laos. It was not
                    accidental that the people we dealt with in the Foreign Ministry on Southeast
                    Asia and on French Africa were either people who had been integrated into the
                    Quai d'Orsay from other Ministries or, in the case of Africa, were in the other
                    Ministries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they brought with them a strong commitment to these
                        areas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: They did, but I think that for their Minister they represented an
                    annoying distraction. I don't think we had any routine contacts with Couve de
                    Murville on either subject.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when the Kennedy Administration came
                        in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This must of made an impact, because Kennedy as a Senator
                        had made at least one speech about how Algeria should be free. During your
                        time there how did you deal with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: It was ambivalence in reverse. They knew the Kennedy policy and were
                    very worried about it, but the person was wildly popular. They liked this new
                    President and his wife who spoke French, who knew France and things French. They
                    were very popular, very popular. I think that applied to the government as well.
                    He got on very well with de Gaulle when they came in May of 1961 on a real
                    old-fashioned state visit. My place at that time was in the Quai d'Orsay, where
                    they stayed; I didn't sleep there but I stayed there with them all day in to
                    late night, every day they were there. I was the liaison between the party and
                    the Quai d'Orsay or the security as far as the minutiae of the visit were
                    concerned. It was wild and hectic and interesting. Kennedy and de Gaulle, I
                    think, got along well. De Gaulle thought of him as an interesting young man; I
                    think the chemistry was good. Their concerns were, of course, Europe; I don't
                    recall whether they talked about Southeast Asia, they may have, but it certainly
                    wasn't on the top of the agenda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you left Paris and went back to Vietnam?
                        Reluctantly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Reluctantly and involuntarily, but I went. Anecdotally, after the
                    Kennedy visit, General Gavin, who was then Ambassador, wanted to move me up to
                    his office. But while that was in the process of developing I was summarily sent
                    back to Vietnam, and I do mean summarily. One telegram—you are transferred, go.
                    I don't think this sort of thing happens anymore. I didn't want to go,
                    especially since between the Ambassador's front office and Vietnam there had
                    emerged that fact that I was not to go to the Ambassador's office but would go
                    back to be the French desk officer. Another reason we didn't want to go back to
                    Vietnam; moreover we had two children by then and the war had started. So for
                    these reasons we did not want to go back. My boss, the Political Counselor, made
                    one telephone check and was told, “Yes, it's real,” so I saluted and reversed
                    course and we went back to Vietnam in September of 1961.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: I was nominally deputy chief of the political section, internal affairs.
                    Political counselor was Joe Mendenhall, another very good writer. One cannot
                    overemphasize the importance of one's superiors as far as one's own development,
                    both personal and professional. Given the situation at that time, he was
                    involved with the Ambassador who was Fritz Nolting, a distinguished gentleman
                    who, I think, had a clear set of instructions to think positively. Bill
                    Trueheart was the DCM and tried very hard to be loyal. At that time the war was
                    going on, our presence had greatly expanded in every area, civilian, military.
                    The government was increasingly in trouble because of its own internal problems
                    and weaknesses. It was a very different situation; one didn't move around the
                    country the way we had before. So my job was essentially was to pick up and do
                    the internal political reporting. It was not a happy time; although I have great
                    respect for Ambassador Nolting as a person, it was quite clear that he wanted
                    everyone to think positively and it was no longer possible to think positively
                    about Vietnam.</p>
                <p>I was involved in various provincial, pacification, community development
                    programs and things like that, but there was throughout a kind of air of—oh,
                    what is the term. We were dogged and determined but the optimism we experienced
                    the first time we were there was long a thing of the past. We were there to do a
                    job, we were fighting a war, a real war—and it was, there was no question about
                    what was going on in the country. We were there to put the best light on it we
                    could; put the best light on it through our work, in the things we were trying
                    to accomplish, that we did, but put the best light on it in the evaluation and
                    analysis of what we were accomplishing, that was much more difficult. We tried,
                    but it was not easy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came back after having been there in the “golden age,”
                        you must have known people since you spoke Vietnamese and you must have been
                        asking these people, both professionally and personally, what had turned the
                        situation around. What answers were you getting?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: On two major areas, internal and external. The external being the Viet
                    Cong, the North Vietnamese insurrection and it was all, of course, “They are
                    doing it to us.” By and large that is true. On the internal one, the weaknesses
                    of the government and its self-generated problems, people were reluctant to
                    talk. It was almost impossible to get anyone who could shed light on the
                    situation to do so; there was just no willingness to do so because everyone was
                    afraid. The tentacles of Ngo Dinh Nhu and the government extended throughout the
                    official apparat and people were very wary of being caught up by them. We had a
                    large military presence enmeshed at the working level of the Vietnamese Air
                    Force; we were providing planes, instructors, etc.; we trained them, we flew
                    with them, and I think it was in February of 1962, we woke up at dawn in Saigon
                    to loud explosions and the noise of airplanes. Two Vietnamese Air Force pilots
                    were bombing the Presidential Palace. Despite our involvement with them, and
                    people in the MAAG knew them, no one had the slightest idea of this kind of
                    feeling being there. There were people who would complain and voice their
                    feelings, but they were not people who would shed light on why specifically they
                    were afraid, what specifically had gone wrong in a particular operation. The
                    Vietnamese are great complainers; they will complain about everything and
                    everybody and you have to factor a lot of that out. It is the problem of finding
                    out why on such and such a date were you told, and what exactly were you told
                    and what did you do. We had a very difficult time getting that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were up against the dilemma of the foreign service
                        officer, which goes on all the time, of having to report accurately and yet
                        be optimistic about the situation. How did this play out as far as you were
                        concerned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Fortunately this is the only time I have experienced it. In everyday
                    ways. You write a telegram, it is sent up for clearance and it comes back with
                    lots of changes. Never a reversal, saying yes means no, never that. It would
                    just come back with a different tone, a different slant; it is very vitiating of
                    one's enthusiasm. This applied also to the rank and file of the CIA station.
                    They had the same problem and we had a good deal of—I can't say
                    collusion—sympathizing back and forth as to what each of us thought should be
                    said and of what in fact was going out. Of course, at this time we were building
                    up more and more; troops were arriving, this was the real period of the arrival
                    of the troops.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the CIA intelligence that they
                        were getting that you were able to sample?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: What they were getting from the Vietnamese was, as I recall, not very
                    good for the reasons I just gave you. They told you what they wanted to tell you
                    or they didn't tell you at all. We harvested lots of lies; some of them we knew
                    were lies, some we didn't. This is a trait, as I told you, that went back even
                    to the very early days; people would rather tell you something untrue than
                    something bad. Now we had this additional element of fear.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned Mendenhall being a good writer. What
                        difference does it make if an Ambassador or a head of section is a good
                        writer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: It is whether you are able to convey to your readers what you want them
                    to know and understand. Mendenhall's position was quite difficult. He shared, I
                    think, the general doubts and skepticism but he tried very hard to be loyal, and
                    succeeded. He wasn't the one who marked things up, they would be marked up
                    farther down the line. He thought we should report things as we saw them, while
                    all the time in there fighting trying to do it. You know what life is like in
                    Washington, but people read that which is easy to read and deals with something
                    that interests them; the shorter the better, the more communicative the better,
                    the easier to understand the better. That is why writing makes all the
                    difference in the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any feedback from Washington, either from
                        people coming through or personal letters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Two kinds, as I recall from my experience. Averell Harriman was the
                    Assistant Secretary for Far Eastern Affairs at that time. He was very skeptical,
                    and I used to see the nasty telegrams, and I am sure there were many more,
                    questioning telegrams from Averell Harriman. “Tell me why this...” “Is it true
                    that...” “How can you say that...” I found them very amusing but I am sure the
                    Ambassador didn't. From the desk we got—the desk was like Joe Mendenhall, in
                    between, they were trying to be intellectually honest but at the same time play
                    the bureaucratic game. If the bureaucratic game was to think positive, then by
                    George they would think positive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you had Averell Harriman as the Assistant Secretary for
                        Far Eastern Affairs skeptical and dubious, where was this positive policy
                        emanating from?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: I am sure it started with the Vietnamese and it started from such things
                    as—and this was after infiltration was evident—”What we really need is tactical
                    air support. If we just had tactical air support then we wouldn't have..,”
                    whatever. So we provided some tactical air support aircraft, like the two that
                    were used to bomb the Presidential palace; we brought in advisors, we
                    camouflaged our military presence, which we doubled from 350 to 700, by
                    pretending that we were there to recover equipment. Anyhow—”If we just had air
                    support.” “Okay, we will give you air support.” “That is not good enough; we
                    need communications, if we just had tactical communications.” “Okay, we will
                    provide them.” So we started sending in more people; then we abandoned the
                    limitation in the Geneva agreement entirely and brought in our own jet aircraft.
                    Now our aircraft, our pilots have to be protected, that means Marines. I
                    remember these episodes—I think it just went on from there, on and on. “We must
                    have more men, more men, more men,” and so it went; we got up to 500,000. When
                    we left in the beginning of 1963, I think we were up to something under
                    50,000.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The real push came in 1964, as I recall, when Johnson
                        said, “Okay, let's do it.” What was your impression of the military men,
                        particularly the captains and the majors, who were out in the field? Did you
                        get to talk to them at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Americans?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Americans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: They were there to do a job, and in the first instance they wanted good
                    relations with their Vietnamese counterparts. They were there to do a job that
                    was training and advisory. It started out to be training and very few of them, I
                    think, saw anything political. I don't want to be unfair to them; my impression
                    was that very few of them raised political questions because they were too
                    concentrated on working with the unit, the region, or the province to which they
                    were assigned and on doing their specific things which they did extremely well.
                    And they didn't stay very long, I think they only stayed a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you look at such things as the “protected hamlet”
                        and “revolutionary cadres” programs of Diem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: We all, people in the Embassy like me, people in the CIA station, and
                    probably in USIS, looked at them very skeptically. What was it, the “defensive
                    hamlet?” Something like that. We armed, we trained, and they kept being overrun.
                    We were all very skeptical but we didn't have anything better to offer, I
                    confess. My own feeling when I left there was that we were in deep enough and I
                    did not believe that the security of the United States was really dependent on
                    the security of South Vietnam. We had put in, I guess, ten thousand people and
                    if they couldn't do it then, we couldn't do it for them. And it became clear
                    they couldn't do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I realize you were mid-career level and all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I was quite junior; I felt as though I were quite junior.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Later on, I was there in 1969, I was the only consul
                        general and I realized that I was just, by about one person, on the upper
                        half of the diplomatic list. I was an FSO 3 at the time and that gives you
                        an idea of how it just got bigger and bigger. What did you feel were
                        American interests? Why were we there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: We were there to fight the North Vietnamese and to try and create the
                    kind of country we visualized in 1955; to do two things at once. There was a
                    third element which was to deal with the internal weaknesses, the self-created,
                    almost willful weaknesses of the Vietnamese government, which were far more
                    pronounced the second time around than they had been the first time. It was
                    really pernicious and pervasive; it was everywhere, the reason people wouldn't
                    talk to us. It was discouraging. I remember we had a provincial development
                    campaign up in south central Vietnam, we worked very hard on it; we drew up the
                    plans, we provided the economic wherewithal, we trained the cadres to go in.
                    “Operation Seaswallow” it was called. We were really going to make the people in
                    the lowlands happy that they were living in this potentially good society. When
                    we got up there we saw that it wasn't really working. Why wasn't it working?
                    Well, it was hard to say; deadlines were not being met, villages were not
                    getting the equipment, the wells or the machinery that had been promised—which
                    we had been promised, which we had been told we would have. Some were delivered
                    and then there was a big incident up there, a military incident, and the whole
                    thing was right back where it was. It was evident that the weakness was in
                    Saigon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you and others at your level thinking that Diem and
                        his family were the problem or were you thinking beyond that to the
                        possibility that it was the Vietnamese way of doing things and putting
                        someone else in wouldn't change things?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: The Nhu problem became evident and acute before long before then.
                    Ambassador Durbrow, Elbridge Durbrow, who left there while we were in Paris,
                    about 1960 and 1961, in his last meeting with Diem told him, diplomatically,
                    that he had to get rid of his brother if he expected to salvage things. Durbrow
                    never saw Diem again. The problem emerged well before the trouble really
                    started.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we transmitting this, that Diem and the Nhus were the
                        trouble?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: No, No. Certainly not at my level. It was obvious—Madame Nhu was called
                    the “Dragon Lady.” He had his fuzzy, woolly-headed philosophy that he wanted
                    everyone to live by, and the corruption both intellectual and pecuniary, were
                    just destroying the basis of everything that we were trying to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a feeling that if you got rid of them that the
                        situation would turn around? Or was it maybe that the system would recreate
                        the same trouble?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: The first part of your question came later. As far as what we felt, at
                    my level, was that you have to give the people a feeling that they had a stake
                    in the country and its development, that they had a stake in its
                    democratization, for that is the only way they had to find some economic
                    fulfillment of their own. That is the way we felt and that was the sort of thing
                    that both inspired us and caused us to be so frustrated because so much of what
                    was happening in Saigon was the kind of thing that would take away the
                    incentive.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you looking to anyplace else—Korea, the

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I am not sure that we did at that time. Earlier I mentioned General
                    Lansdale and I think he was trying to emulate Magsaysay. I don't recall any at
                    that time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: No, it was not out of bounds; I had a lot of contact with them during
                    the course of these various civilian-military socio-economic programs that we
                    had. My wife taught English to Lieutenants and Captains and we used to see them.
                    So we had a fair amount of dealings with the military.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Yes, or I might be sending a message. So we were interested, eager to
                    hear, but I didn't from my position try to incite messages of dissidence. They
                    were very impressive; I remember going out to visit one unit, having lunch with
                    them, and there were some paratrooper officers there. I asked them whether they
                    had made any combat jumps, thinking of our own World War II experiences when
                    they made one or two, and one of them said he had had twenty-one operational
                    jumps. I remember it vividly; and that was 1962 and many of them were at
                    night.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nolting was there the entire time that you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Trueheart? These were two men who were
                        University of Virginia pals, this was supposed to be an Ambassador-DCM
                        combination made in heaven, but it didn't work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Well because Trueheart developed the kinds of impressions that everyone
                    else was living with. “It isn't working, boss, and we have to recognize certain
                    basic weaknesses in our policy and what we are doing.” Nolting, I guess, just
                    didn't want to hear it from his best friend. Their friendship, I don't know that
                    it was totally destroyed...</p>

                <p>BARBOUR: Certainly it ended. Trueheart became very disaffected.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Trueheart was very loyal when he arrived; he is very perceptive and I
                    think after a while it all got to his intellect, he reached some very profound
                    personal conclusions, and I think also things came to a head—I don't know if you
                    are talking to Bill Trueheart.</p>

                <p>BARBOUR: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is March the 7th, 1994. We continue. You left
                        Vietnam in 1963 and came back to the Department where you served from 1963
                        to 1967. What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I started out as Portuguese desk officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How, from your background, did you come to be Portuguese
                        desk officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I don't know. We had had three years in Paris and I had known Frank
                    Malloy previously, and he was the director for Western Europe. So I suppose that
                    and Paris and need produced the effect of my going in as Portuguese desk
                    officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Portugal has always been sort of the odd man out, a member
                        of NATO since the beginning practically, but except for the Azores Portugal
                        doesn't seem to raise a blip. What was the situation when you arrived there
                        in 1963?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Your estimate is entirely correct as far as the absence of blips on
                    anybody's screen, which made the job very valuable as far as the desk officer
                    was concerned. On the one hand we had a history of relationships with Portugal,
                    we had the base in the Azores, we had a Portuguese community in the United
                    States, we had the NATO membership, which gave it a certain intrinsic interest.
                    On the other hand it was the Kennedy administration and there was indeed
                    Africa—Angola and Mozambique—there was also Salazar and his men and our
                    relations were far from good which meant that there was a certain amount of
                    business to be done but nobody wanted to be bothered with it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A desk officer's delight.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Looking back at one time, I found that of all the instructions that were
                    sent to Lisbon in the roughly fourteen to fifteen months that I was on the job,
                    only one did I not write. In fact, during that period... A chronic problem with
                    Portugal was their desire to buy arms and our reluctance to sell them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was because of Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Yes, their desire to buy arms because they were a member of NATO, that
                    was their justification, and our reluctance to sell them because we feared they
                    would be used in Africa. At one time I wrote a telegram explaining some terms
                    and conditions under which we might be willing to sell them or to refuse to sell
                    them. It was a telegram cleared up the line in the Department, then it
                    disappeared. We checked around and found that it had been sent over to the White
                    House. A few days later it came back and one of the clearances on the bottom was
                    of the President. It was an interesting time; we had a change of Ambassadors
                    while I was on the desk. Admiral George Anderson, Chief of Naval Operations, who
                    had the temerity before the Armed Services Committee to express a policy line on
                    aircraft carriers, he being an aviator, that was different from that of the
                    administration. So President Kennedy took offense and said, “I want him out.”
                    And outed he was; he was named Ambassador to Portugal. There was a certain
                    period of standoff while Admiral Anderson sat at his office in the Pentagon
                    running the navy and the Department wasn't sure how to contact him. They decided
                    that there was always an expendable desk officer they could send over and see
                    what might happen to him, whether he would come back intact or not. So off I
                    went to call on Admiral Anderson. A very imposing man. I went in and he was
                    sitting in his captain's chair, literally, in an office I thought rather modest.
                    We chatted about Portugal and he expressed his displeasure with our policies
                    toward Portugal and how difficult it was going to be to persuade the Portuguese
                    of the righteousness of American policies. I, to my own astonishment, said,
                    “That will be your job, Admiral.” I was an FSO 4 then and he was a four star
                    Admiral and I couldn't imagine those words were coming out of my mouth. There
                    was a lot of trepidation about Admiral Anderson and I remember someone saying,
                    “He's going to be fighting his instructions every step of the way.” In fact, he
                    turned out to be a very good Ambassador; he was a very impressive, imposing
                    individual, great presence, and he did not fight his instructions. He carried
                    them out loyally despite his own feelings; I am sure the Portuguese knew what
                    those feelings were which may have given him even greater impact. He served
                    well; he was a good Ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were his feelings?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: He thought we were doing Portugal a great injustice by imposing various
                    kinds of limitations on what we were willing to do, on our cooperation, on our
                    willingness to sell arms, that it was not getting a fair shake as a member of
                    NATO, as an ally, and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you might say it was this thing that we had for a very
                        long time with colonial powers, and this was early into the
                        decolonization.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: It was more than that, because I arrived in 1963, and revolts broke out
                    in Africa in, I think, 1961, and the Portuguese reaction was rather severe. The
                    Portuguese were not good colonizers; they went the farthest toward assimilation
                    and integration, but they did not make the investments, the social investments,
                    in education, health services, opportunities, that a couple of other European
                    countries did. So the reaction was severe in its small ways, because the
                    Portuguese couldn't afford to do an awful lot in Africa. They began repression
                    of the rebellion which is ironic today because it is still going on in
                    Angola—the same players, the same forces, the same issues. Then there was the
                    Salazar factor. Salazar was a vestige of the 1930's; he wasn't by any means a
                    Mussolini or a Hitler, but he was a very autocratic ruler. Very much an
                    anachronism in his personal manners—his high top shoes, things like that. He ran
                    Portugal with an iron hand, and Portugal, the m�tropole, was an oligarchy not
                    doing too badly, but we didn't like his style of government and considered him
                    and it out of date, especially in that idealistic period of American policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we up against a basic problem of trying to keep
                        people from going to visit Portugal? I am talking about high officials. Were
                        we in a sort of “minimize” situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: No, we didn't need to keep people from going because nobody went. There
                    was not much interest in going—or to Africa. There was a public relations firm
                    in Washington hired by the Portuguese government called Selvage and Lee,
                    something like that, I am not sure of the exact name. We were reluctant to have
                    any dealings with them but once again it was decided that maybe we shouldn't
                    break off all communications with these people who did want to see people in the
                    Department. Let the desk officer deal with that, once again. I would agree in
                    those days it was possible to go out to lunch with them, to listen to them, to
                    write memoranda and let them unburden themselves, for which they collected a
                    large fee, I am sure. And that was that. They organized tours to Angola and
                    Mozambique, though of course we could never go on anything like that—I think
                    that my successor may have gone.</p>

                <p>BARBOUR: To Portugal, yes; to Portuguese Africa, no. I went to Lisbon once in the
                    fourteen months I was on the desk and actually stayed with Admiral Anderson for
                    whom I came to have great respect.</p>

                <p>BARBOUR: Oh really. He was such an impressive man; always good to the desk
                    officer, no matter what the occasion in Washington, who he was meeting, he
                    always took the occasion to express his appreciation for the support he received
                    and said nice things about his desk officer, which I have always tried to copy,
                    remembering him as I did so.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: It was not a big Embassy; the Ambassador, the DCM, maybe two political
                    officers and two economic officers, a commercial officer, a small consular
                    section. It was not big, rather tidy and in an old rundown office building.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just wondering if, since it was a backwater, and I
                        don't mean to be pejorative, we used it to send people who were not moving
                        on ahead, or was it a standard Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: It was a standard Embassy; we also had the consulate in Oporto. Portugal
                    was a desirable place to go as far as living. The Portuguese were very pleasant,
                    life was good and cheap, very cheap; my impression was that it was about an
                    average Embassy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Since George Kennan was there. It was reporting on what was going on in
                    the government of Salazar. We were interested in economic policies. Portugal was
                    still a corporative state, sort of along Italian lines. It called itself a
                    corporative state; that was Salazar's idea. We had some business interests,
                    investment; we did have an active commercial program. The reporting was largely
                    domestic developments in the political sector. We were extremely interested in
                    any trends there might have been toward liberalization, some relaxation, etc. We
                    were always looking for that, we never got much but we were always looking,
                    hoping.</p>

                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: Yes, a consulate in Luanda and a consulate in Mozambique, a

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: They reported to AF, so that every telegram that went out in the way of
                    instructions or comments to Lisbon had to be cleared with both AF and IO, the
                    U.N. office. And there were battles, battles, battles.</p>

                    was the director of AF South, and his desk officer was Matt Looram; then later,
                    I think Charlie Whitehouse replaced Mac Godley. They were worthy adversaries. I
                    forget who was in IO, but this was a very liberal period.</p>

                <p>BARBOUR: Soapy Williams was the Assistant Secretary and Wayne Fredericks was the
                    deputy. In IO Joe Sisco was the office director. It was frequently difficult,
                    but I must say never unpleasant. We would have lots of bureaucratic battles; it
                    would be over words. We can't say that; It doesn't agree with our policy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The African Bureau then was pushing for making known our

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Supporting; moral support at least to the insurgents and we, of course,
                    were saying, “You can't do that.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any concern on your side that these insurgents
                        represented Soviet influence? Was this bandied about?</hi>

                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: Oh sure; that was a possibility although it became much more acute under
                    Kissinger. We were overtly involved with them then; I think we were giving them
                    scholarships and money for the insurgents, money for medicines and education
                    through foundations. I don't think there was anything covert going on though I
                    am not sure. Indeed overtly and politically and psychologically we gave them
                    lots of moral support. Our European Bureau was trying to maintain the line that
                    Portugal was an ally, a member of NATO, and we couldn't go around subverting
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this play with the African Bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: We always worked it out; but we had various devices which are no longer
                    possible. I am sure you are familiar with them. If you wrote a telegram it went
                    on the green sheet of paper, which was the original and the one from which the
                    encrypted telegram was sent. So what you did was, you wouldn't send the original
                    around to your adversaries for clearance, you would send a carbon and say, “We
                    have to have it back in three days.” No return, send it anyway. Of course, that
                    was rather high handed and didn't work very often. Then, as happened once under
                    my predecessor when a telegram was sent for clearance and the Africans added a
                    paragraph and then sent it, you would draw a line from the last word all the way
                    down to the bottom of the page so that nothing could be added. We always worked
                    it out. Sometimes we had to take our compromises up to Soapy Williams in his
                    office late at night, but again with Mac Godley and Matt Looram, who are very
                    intelligent people, and in the UN, I think Mike Newlin was there, we always
                    worked it out.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: That was one of the things we didn't want to jeopardize. It certainly
                    was not a factor in our relations with Portugal, they didn't wave it at us,
                    saying you behave or out you go.</p>

                        Washington when there were problems? Could he use his Pentagon allies to
                        help?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: No, he didn't do that. He established credibility simply by his loyalty
                    to his instructions and he would go in and tell the Portuguese things they would
                    rather not hear. He was a man of parts anyway; yes, he had credibility here. It
                    was just that Portugal at that time was not high on the screen. There was one
                    episode involving George Ball when I think he actually went to talk with
                    Salazar, a meeting of which nothing came. The thought was that he would go and
                    talk with Salazar and persuade him, perhaps, that if he relaxed his policies in
                    Angola and Mozambique then maybe we could find some way of responding. It was
                    very tenuous, very unsuccessful and that was the only high level interest that
                    came of it; I, of course, wrote all the papers for Ball.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Ball's impression of Salazar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I vaguely remember that he considered him an anachronism; there was no
                    personal rapport whatsoever. Salazar was indeed a strange individual, he had
                    been a bachelor all his life, lived a spartan existence with his sister and was
                    impervious to outside influence. There was not much rapport in the meeting. The
                    Foreign Minister was at that time, I think, Machado; he was a lively, outgoing
                    individual, spoke excellent English and came here on a visit. He was unbending
                    when it came to politics, but an articulate exponent of it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your responsibilities during this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: It was going from one extreme to the other; from a country which didn't
                    command a lot of attention to one that found everyone in Washington an expert.
                    Everybody knew everything about France, everybody wanted to play in the game;
                    Ball was interested in France. The White House was much less interested under
                    Johnson, not to the same degree that the Kennedy White House had been. It was
                    not just the official community that wanted to be involved in France and knew
                    more than everybody else, lots of people outside as well.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: The French Embassy was also an important factor. Herv� Alphand, the
                    Ambassador, and his sparkling wife were the ultimate of Embassies. Everybody
                    wanted to be invited to the French Embassy. They entertained all the time, very
                    skillfully, not lavishly but very, very well. The French Embassy was the social
                    center of Washington. They used it extremely well; Alphand was a consummate
                    diplomat, very popular, he had a reach all over town. He could pick up the
                    telephone and call anybody, I guess no longer the President at that time, he
                    could go see them, and he made no bones about laying down the French position in
                    whatever terms it took; he was very effective, and it didn't interfere with his
                    personal popularity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about the time when de Gaulle was de
                        Gaulle. This was a real change in the situation in that France was moving on
                        an independent course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: In the first instance the French preoccupation had been with Algeria, a
                    policy with which we were very uncomfortable but about which we were very
                    uncertain. No one really knew what de Gaulle's intentions were; whether he was
                    going to be the person he turned out to be, or whether he was going to crack
                    down and make his peace with the military. We suspected the former, but had
                    nothing to go on. We did have a superb Ambassador in Paris who had a
                    communication, a dialog with the French that has rarely been equaled. This was
                    Chip Bohlen. Our relations with France were correct, sometimes cordial,
                    sometimes frosty, but he never lost communication. He could see anybody; he
                    could see de Gaulle whenever he wanted, but of course he didn't overwork that.
                    He played golf with Couve de Murville almost every Sunday. They found him worth
                    talking to and therefore they gave him the time and the access. So we had a very
                    active relationship with France for all those reasons and they encompassed all
                    fields but were particularly focused on France and Europe, France and NATO,
                    France and us.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you the desk officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I was the desk officer and so—how did the lowly desk officer play in
                    that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes; this is a whole different game from before; this is
                        the 1964 to 1967 period.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: At the very beginning, before I went on to the desk, I realized that we
                    had in Washington a rather awesome local Ambassador, Alphand. I had been on the
                    desk for some period of time and I had met him in meetings. My wife and I were
                    invited to a large reception and there he and his wife were in the receiving
                    line, and as my wife and I approached he turned and his face lit up and he shook
                    hands and said, “How nice to see you here; come let me show you my paintings.”
                    He left the receiving line and took us around and showed us the paintings and
                    the lovely residence. This was no mark of personal recognition; what he was
                    doing was showing that he recognized that a desk officer, even way down where
                    you are, is still important later in the game. And that is true; no matter how
                    many other things are going on it is the desk officer who writes the basic
                    papers, it is the desk officer who requests the appointments, it is the desk
                    officer who prepares the records. Not just for him, he had his own means of
                    access, but for his Embassy. No matter what, the official relations with France
                    were, for the most part, funneled through the Department and most of it started
                    at the lowest level which was the desk officer. So we on the desk, Dick Wyman
                    and Dick Aherne, the assistant desk officer, were involved in all the basic
                    parts that go into implementing a policy. Our policy at that time was, I think,
                    to make the best of de Gaulle and to hope for the best, and we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did de Gaulle pull out of NATO or make his
                        announcement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: He threw us out of France in 1966; by the time I came on the desk he had
                    already withdrawn from the integrated command structure. The big problem while I
                    was on the desk was the American withdrawal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had that already been announced?</hi>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Well, it was dramatic. Bohlen told us at least a month, or months, in
                    advance that he thought it was going to happen. There were various people to
                    whom he talked regularly and he discerned—and perhaps some were trying to tell
                    him without being disloyal—that this was going to happen. He was right. It was
                    announced in a press conference, as I recall, but we, the U.S., had been warned
                    to expect it well in advance. It is possible that these people talking to Bohlen
                    had been instructed to let us know without saying so.</p>

                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: People were very upset about it but there was nothing we could do and
                    we, the President, took the position that we should comply with it. If they
                    wanted us to be out within a defined period we shall be out. And we were out! We
                    had a lot of bases, rather large facilities, in France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of work did this cause for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I am trying to recall any specific activities that resulted from that
                    aside from papers, the usual papers—what lies behind it, what his intentions
                    are. Life on the desk at that level went on; the turmoil obviously was much
                    higher. Bill Tyler was the Assistant Secretary, he knew all about France and
                    then he was replaced by John Leddy who was working with Ball and the Secretary.
                    The turmoil in the relationships existed side by side with business as usual and
                    I was more the business as usual side.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: They went through that and decided no. There was no point to it; there
                    was nothing we could do and France was still France and de Gaulle was very much
                    in charge and he was changing the rules of the game. We had constant
                    frustrations with his strategic policies—the independent force de frappe and
                    their own, as it was sometimes called, “tear off an arm” strategic policy—we may
                    not be able to do much but we will at least tear off an arm and make them sorry.
                    So they developed their own strategic forces...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are talking about nuclear forces?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Nuclear forces. At that time they only had two of the manned bombers and
                    then they got into submarines, with no help from us. Their refueling aircraft
                    were all American. They had their testing; they continued to test in the
                    atmosphere long after we stopped. That was an annoyance but there was nothing we
                    could do about it. We had one awful episode in which American aircraft based in
                    France, this would have been before 1966, in 1965 I guess, flew over the French
                    nuclear plant at Pierrelatte, made a number of passes at it photographing all
                    the time. The French sent their aircraft up to intercept and force us down but
                    we could outrun them. It was for four or five days a wild time; the French were
                    incensed, our Air Force was evasive, the Department of State had one reaction
                    and I think the Pentagon had another. When the aircraft returned to their base
                    which was French, there was the base commander to greet them saying “give me
                    that film.” And they handed it over to him! It was the only time in my entire
                    service that the Secretary of State called me at home; he asked, “What on earth
                    is this all about? What has happened? What is the state of play?” He could not
                    believe it when I told him that we handed the film back. That was Dean Rusk. It
                    was a very active time.</p>

                        album of pictures of his nuclear establishments. I remember the incident and
                        particularly the column which was hilarious, talking about how it was going
                        to be a surprise photo album of his nuclear establishments.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: We denied that we were doing it to take photographs; it was just
                    training practice and things like that. I was on the telephone two or three
                    times a day, at least, with Bob McBride, the DCM in Paris. At that time, to make
                    a telephone call to Paris was less routine than it is today; we were constantly
                    on the phone, day and night. But life went on. There was another episode when
                    the first astronauts, who were then world celebrities, were being feted at a
                    dinner on the eighth floor of the Department by the President. This was when he
                    had been reelected and Hubert Humphrey was the Vice President. I was at home
                    that night minding my own business when John Leddy called and said, “Don't do
                    anything, but I want to tip you off that the President may decide to send the
                    astronauts to Paris with the Vice President.” So I thought a moment, and then
                    taking a deep breath I called Bob McBride in Paris, it must have been three
                    o'clock in the morning their time, and said, “Don't tell anybody I have called
                    but you should know that you may be in for a surprise.” And I told him and then
                    said, “But don't do anything, I'll call you back.” No sooner had I hung up than
                    John Leddy called again and said, “They are leaving immediately. You better tell
                    Paris.” So I called him back and told him; you can imagine—they are arriving in
                    seven hours. Then George Ball called and wanted to talk about the Embassy and
                    its preparations, etc., and then he said, “You better call Stan Carpenter,” head
                    of the economic section, “and let him know.” Ball knew Carpenter very well. Then
                    he said, strange words in today's context, “Very well, I am leaving everything
                    in your hands.” So I went down to the Operations Center and set up and we opened
                    up a telephone line. I remember saying to McBride on the telephone, this must
                    have been 11:00 P.M., “I can see the helicopters lifting off from the White
                    House. Good luck.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the “corridor” estimate of de Gaulle within EUR
                        at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: De Gaulle was a prickly enigma; he was not responsive to the urgings of
                    American policymakers. He was not hostile and in fact during the Cuba crisis of
                    1962 he made it clear that he would stand with the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the strongest supporter.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: He wasn't enthusiastic but he minced no words. So he commanded
                    tremendous respect, of that there is no question. We were impressed by what he
                    was achieving. We still saw France in terms of what it was coming out of—the
                    Fourth Republic, much easier to deal with but much less effective on the world
                    stage. So what he had achieved in France in terms of unity, cohesion and
                    orderliness, commanded great respect, despite everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel any sense of a mood that because France was
                        out of NATO we had better put more chips in the kitty with Germany?Did you
                        feel any shift to a more German centered policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: No, I didn't sense it, not at my level, at least. Germany was obviously
                    a growing power, but at that time it had not emerged onto the stage to the
                    extent it did later. We, of course, moved a lot of things to Germany and we were
                    actively building up Germany politically. So I may be contradicting myself when
                    I say “no, not at my level,” when the fact is what you say was going on. But it
                    was not at the expense of France because our relations were just too broad;
                    every government agency in Washington had something going with France or had an
                    interest there that they wanted to protect and this continued after we got out.
                    France was still a part of NATO; a year or so after I left there were some very
                    quiet coordinating relationships with the French general staff, again at de
                    Gaulle's direction. The important relationships were maintained and France was
                    very much an ally. Giscard d'Estaing came here on a state visit, there were
                    constant comings and goings, they participated in all NATO ministerial meetings,
                    foreign and defense. So despite the downs in the relationship France remained
                    very much a player in European politics as far as we were concerned. The
                    relations between France and Germany had been solidified in 1963 by the de
                    Gaulle and Adenauer agreement on, among other things, cultural exchanges which
                    launched a vast program of cultural exchanges for students. It was a real
                    reconciliation which was due to the historical perspectives of the two
                    leaders.</p>

                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: The French did not approve of what we were doing in Laos, Cambodia, or
                    Vietnam, and they had made that quite clear. It was a subject of various
                    conversations for which I was the note taker but I do not recall it being much a
                    part of the activities in which I participated. They kept telling us it was
                    going to go wrong, they were not cooperative because they thought we were making
                    an enormous mistake, and as far as I was concerned, I do not recall writing any
                    papers on Vietnam except on a couple of de Gaulle press conference items. We got
                    it off of our AFP ticker, live, so to speak, and had to have something up to
                    George Ball by the end of the day. Since we got them in late afternoon we had to
                    be very quick and I remember that there was not even time to clear it with FE,
                    as it was then called. That, of course, was very nice from our standpoint, it
                    went straight up to Ball. But I don't remember serious policy operations between
                    France and the United States on Southeast Asia. The lines were too clearly
                    drawn.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: First I went to the Foreign Service Institute to study Italian and while
                    I was there, one Saturday morning I was called on the phone by Walter Stoessel
                    and asked if I would go to the ESSGA, the Emergency Special Session of the
                    General Assembly, following the Six Day War. They needed someone to be the EUR
                    fellow up there, would I go? I said yes if I could go back to school when it was
                    over. So off I went to New York for that special session. It was very
                    glittering, at the Ministerial level. That was, of course, at the time of the
                    Glassboro meeting...</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Exactly. Tommy Thompson, who at that time was the advisor on Soviet
                    relations, was there as counselor; he was the intermediary. The Romanians were
                    there and we were trying to draw the Romanians out of the Soviet orbit. It was
                    an exciting week. I was the note taker for everything Rusk participated in with
                    Europeans.</p>

                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: Settlement, certainly an Israeli-Arab settlement. Abba Eban was there,
                    the Foreign Minister of Israel, and I remember he told Dean Rusk—I guess I heard
                    the Secretary tell somebody else since I would not have been at that
                    meeting—that everything was negotiable except the Golan Heights. That is
                    interesting today. We were interested in the Romanians. All the NATO Foreign
                    Ministers were there; they were very exercised about de Gaulle's attitude during
                    the Six Day War. Mr. Harmel was there from Belgium. De Gaulle had made some
                    statements that were really strange; I don't recall the text but they were
                    somewhat out of character and not very realistic we thought, very critical of
                    Israel and the Western Powers. It didn't seem to fit into anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was interpreted at the time that de Gaulle was
                        going to jump into the Arab camp; that he was taking advantage of a
                        difficult time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I remember I was walking with Mr. Harmel, it must have been just after
                    his meeting with the Secretary, and he was chatting about how strange these
                    remarks were. And I said, “Yes, I think General de Gaulle has slipped his
                    trolley.” Again, I was shocked at my own brashness and he was too.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Back to Italian, then went to Rome in September of 1967, with my family
                    by ship.</p>

                    wonderful time; lots of children, lots of programs for children. Ten or twelve
                    days to Naples via Casa Blanca, Gibraltar, Barcelona, Nice, Monaco, Genoa.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I started out as number two in the political section with the external
                    portfolio, dealing with the Foreign Ministry. That was a very topical portfolio—
                    whatever was going on consult the Italians on, Africa, Europe, Middle East, Far
                    East, whatever. It was Italian foreign policy which was, after France, very
                    different from working with French policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Ambassador, the DCM, and the chief political

                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: Fred Reinhardt was the Ambassador, a superb Ambassador; a man of great
                    of presence, knew the Italians, commanded wide respect. Frank Malloy was the
                    DCM, obviously how I happened to go there, and Sam Gammon was the counselor for
                    political affairs. Very strong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One has a pretty good shot at what French foreign policy
                        is, even though it is at odds with the United States, but Italian policy
                        seems hard to grasp. How would you describe the basics of Italian foreign
                        policy and our role in it at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: In the context of France, it was the mirror image. Dean Acheson said
                    that de Gaulle created an image of a France that gave an impression of strength
                    that did not exist. Italians had the wherewithal for an active and strong
                    foreign policy but they chose not to exercise it. Their interests were Europe
                    and the United States, and to some degree former Italian parts of Africa. They
                    maintained relations with everybody, had Embassies all over the world, had
                    commercial and economic interests, but foreign political interests of a world
                    scale they did not have. I remember during my time in Washington when we created
                    in NATO the nuclear planning group that was to have been of five countries;
                    Italy was not included in the original group because it was a non-nuclear power.
                    The Italians were terribly upset at being left out, and by dint of stirring up
                    great commotion they managed to get themselves included. The reason that they
                    were so concerned is very typical of their foreign policy interests—it would
                    have looked bad for Italy to be left out. Impressions, appearance; appearances
                    are very important. Appearances would have been bad to have been left out so
                    they got themselves in and didn't play much of a role, of course.</p>
                <p>Their Ambassador then was ..?.. who was somewhat the Italian counterpart of
                    Alphand; he cut a wide swath in Washington society. Very active, lived in that
                    residence up on Sixteenth Street where he was mugged once as I recall, and a
                    rock was thrown through the window. It was not a happy neighborhood but they
                    hung on there for a long time. He played a role in Washington that was
                    disproportionate to their interests and disproportionately large to what they
                    had to contribute, but disproportionately large in those areas that really
                    mattered, relations with the United States and NATO. EC at that time was just in
                    the developing stage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find your political section working with your desk
                        to make sure that the Italians were included in things?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: No, we didn't have to play that role; the Italians played that very
                    successfully and skillfully for themselves. The reporting was basically on
                    Italian politics, trying to keep things sorted out; who was up who was down,
                    what party A was doing, what party B was doing. The reporting assignments were
                    divided up so that one person did the Christian Democratic Party and the
                    Vatican, one person did the left, the Socialists and Communists, and I think
                    there was a third person who did all other parties. So we had three people on
                    Italian domestic politics, which is, of course, a great game. The Italians
                    invented the game and played it better than anybody else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were a new boy on the block, you weren't one of the
                        old Italian hands. I must say in my short time in Italy I wondered whether
                        the game was worth it though it was interesting; nothing seemed to change.
                        Did you ever have that feeling, wondering what it was all about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: No, I don't think it was “what is this all about?”. The first item of
                    priority in Italian domestic politics at that time was relations with the
                    communists, PCI; we didn't see them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We didn't have any contact with them at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Overtly we had no contact, covertly we had some very low level,
                    discrete, and unproductive and uninteresting contacts. They were not interested
                    in dealing with us in that way, they wanted to talk to the Americans in the
                    middle of the street and be seen doing it. So we were very skittish of the
                    communists and we were very skittish of the Italian establishment's dealings
                    with them that were taking place all the time, even more than we knew. The
                    Foreign Minister was, or became after I arrived, Pietro Nenni, a Socialist.
                    There was a lot of ruffling of feathers in Washington because Socialists at that
                    time were just one shade away from communists. So it was the Communist Party,
                    its ups and downs, and ambitions, and presumptuousness that was our first
                    concern. Secondly, and to a much greater extent as time passed, was the internal
                    weakness of the Christian Democratic Party. We knew, and kept saying, that
                    though governments came and went all the time that was stability not instability
                    because look who was in them. You also had the opening to the left when the
                    Socialists were brought in. That had taken place before I arrived but it was
                    then in play, so the maneuverings had their interesting and important gradations
                    and we were very much a part of reporting them and analyzing them. The interest
                    was very high. You mentioned earlier the Congressional attitude toward France,
                    it was much greater toward Italy because you had a small but very active, an
                    occasionally emotional, Italian constituency there which the Italians knew how
                    to work very well.</p>

                <p>BARBOUR: No, but we were afraid it might, that they might let the communists in
                    and then goodness knows what might happen. We had, and I guess still do, some
                    very important military facilities in Italy. We were concerned mostly about
                    that; and we were concerned about keeping the establishment in office, helping
                    it, supporting it, which was the reason that we would not undercut them by
                    seeing the communists. It was all very active and at that time given great
                    importance.</p>

                        to the Christian Democrats? It was certainly an open secret that we made
                        tremendous contributions back in 1948 to the election, but the charge has
                        been leveled at us today that by our contributions we helped sustain a very
                        corrupt regime.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I don't there there is any question, we were terribly afraid of the
                    alternative. The alternative was the left—the Communists and the Socialists. We
                    remained at that time very concerned about the possibilities that the Communists
                    would gain strength.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, how did we view the Communists as being a

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: If you were in a communist party anywhere you were ipso facto a tool of
                    the Soviets. I don't think we made any distinction between the two. The Italian
                    Communists at that time still had the post Togliatti leadership, Enrico
                    Berlinguer, and on foreign policy he toed the Soviet line, he never departed
                    from it. On internal things he had his own ideas, but on NATO, Germany, he was
                    very much a supporter of the communists; he was not the apologist that the
                    French communists were but he certainly was a supporter. He had to, that was
                    where his money was coming from.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: It was not an issue; I do not recall it being an issue. There would be
                    occasional strikes and things like that. But don't forget that the Italian trade
                    unions, each one of which belonged to a different party, were also very much a
                    part of the establishment.</p>

                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: No, the most serious events, with enormous implications for the
                    following years, were the beginnings of extreme left radicalism. I remember that
                    one day about noon I was going to the Foreign Ministry in an Embassy car and we
                    drove through a park, I forget its name, and suddenly we were surrounded by
                    students and police. There was a big riot going on; we were not bothered as we
                    were on the fringes. You could flag that as the beginning of the far left
                    turmoil in Italian politics which went on for some years, and indeed the Red
                    Brigades and others soon followed. That December, 1968 I guess, the Milan
                    bombings and the Banca ..?.. bombing, which was just around the corner from the
                    Embassy. One evening about six o'clock a big bang ..?.. the building, I walked
                    over to see what was going on and somebody said the boiler had blown up. It was
                    not that at all, it was a bomb. That was the episode and the beginning of a
                    situation that become much worse in the ensuing two or three years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had a Red Brigade killing in Naples in 1980. Were we

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Not internally, nobody was. They were quite closed at the beginning. I
                    think our estimate of them at the time was correct—unpredictable and dangerous,
                    likely to grow. The Italian reaction at that time was somewhat confused; this
                    was at the early stages, before the Italians got into them through their own
                    drug addicts which really broke the backbone some years later. It was a
                    difficult period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have much of a feel for what was going on in the
                        universities at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: The Italian universities at that time were to a large degree written off
                    by us as educational institutions. They were hotbeds of political extremism, the
                    students were students in name only, their degrees were not worth anything. I
                    don't know if I am answering your question. We accepted them as being hothouses
                    of political radicalism.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: No. These people were different, these people were really wild and they
                    were killing people. Other than that, that evaluation of the Italian university
                    system—there were a couple that were considered least political; I think Pisa
                    maintained a standard and maybe Torino. Certainly the University of Rome was
                    really out of bounds.</p>

                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: There were two phases. One when I was doing external affairs. In
                    December of 1967, as I shaved that morning I heard that the King of Greece had
                    arrived in the middle of the night, in exile from a failed anti-Colonels coup in
                    Athens in April. I heard it on the radio and then as I walked to work past the
                    Greek Embassy it was surrounded by police, television vans, and the usual
                    turmoil that goes with that sort of thing. Late that afternoon I went over to
                    the Spanish Embassy to call on a colleague and got back to the Embassy about
                    7:00 and was called in to see the Ambassador. He said that he had been on the
                    phone with the Department about the King and they had said that they wanted to
                    get in touch with him and keep in touch with him; “detail somebody to that job.”
                    So he wanted me to do that. He had arranged to call on the King that evening at
                    9:00 but was leaving by train at 10:30 to go skiing with his son. I would go
                    with him to go see the King and do whatever was necessary after that. So off we
                    went to see the King, who was in his cousin's—the Duke of Hesse—beautiful little
                    villa smack in the middle of Rome, concealed from sight, behind walls, enclosing
                    about ten acres; a little jewel. We talked to him and he gave us his version of
                    what had happened, why he was there and who had let him down, things like that.
                    Then we walked out through the paparazzi and the hordes of newspapermen and
                    klieg lights to the car and Reinhardt said, “Don't stop.” We went back to his
                    house while he packed his bag and said to me, “Now you go back to the Embassy
                    and I'll be up in (so-and-so) and call me if you need me.” That was the
                    beginning of an episode that lasted all the time I was in Rome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean a continuing relationship with the King?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the King?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I don't want to go into too much detail because he is still...I don't
                    think it would be fair to him. I had an intimate relationship with him, I saw
                    him frequently. During those days when Reinhardt was skiing, I saw him at least
                    once a day, at his request. I climbed over fences and went through back walls
                    and went back and wrote a telegram, never indicating that the Ambassador was out
                    of town. “Constantine told us this afternoon...</p>
                <p>In response to Constantine's request for a meeting...” I never fingered the
                    Ambassador for being away. In the early days it was an interesting and exciting
                    period and we kept it quiet, I must say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: We didn't know, we weren't sure what our interest was. This was 1967,
                    Johnson was President. We didn't really know what to make of it, or him, or the
                    situation in Greece. We were not comfortable with the Colonels; Constantine had
                    had a good image in Washington, but we didn't know what to make of him and this
                    may have been the first time that we ever had anyone who spent long hours with
                    him while he talked. For somebody in my situation it was quite interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was his mother, Queen Frederika, around, was she a
                        factor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: She was there when he arrived. He arrived with his mother, wife, two
                    children and his sister, and Ambassador—I have forgotten his name—who was his
                    Grand Chamberlain. The King wanted to talk about Greek personalities who were
                    rather far off my screen at that time; but fortunately everything is phonetic,
                    at least I could write down the sounds. It was an interesting period,
                    interesting but I don't think very important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You continued this until the time you left in 1972?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Yes. He moved out of the Embassy where the Ambassador was extremely
                    uncomfortable having him as a guest; he moved from there to a hotel, another
                    hotel, into a house on the Appian Way and then into a house in the country. I
                    saw him, of course, with less and less frequency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find a change in this relationship when the Nixon

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Yes, there was a change because we no longer had any doubts. Kissinger
                    came in with realpolitik, one hundred percent pragmatism exactly; the Colonels
                    were in, the King was out, so be it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did this do to this connection that you had?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: It had never been easy for him to establish a direct, substantive
                    relationship with people in Washington at the highest levels, but there had been
                    a semblance of interest and that semblance ended.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: Of course he always dreamed of going back and resuming his throne and
                    was always led to believe by the various players that maybe a deal could be made
                    or something would come of it. His dreams were always of resuming his throne.
                    The people in Athens never told him it was utterly impossible, in fact the
                    reverse. He kept his airplane for a long time, the airplane that he had flown to
                    Rome on; it stayed there for some months, as I recall, and finally he sent it
                    back. They maintained a civil list for him and he was in communication with
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't a violent break, he made his move but it wasn't
                        a bloody one. The royal family there had never completely taken in Greece,
                        it was a German family and Queen Frederika had gotten a lot of notoriety
                        because of her political views. It wasn't a beloved relationship. Also he
                        failed; if you do a coup and then fail, well the Greeks are political
                        animals.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: He probably had a role there as a British type monarch, someone who
                    represents national unity above the constant warring of the political
                    parties.</p>

                <p>BARBOUR: Lyndon Johnson, December 1967, had gone to the funeral of the Australian
                    Prime Minister who died while swimming. While there he felt he had to return by
                    way of Vietnam, none of this had anything to do with Rome. In the third week of
                    December, I suppose, Harry Shlaudeman, who was working for the Secretary then,
                    showed up in Rome and was seen in and out of the Ambassador's office several
                    times. I think, in retrospect, Harry had been sent there by the Secretary to
                    tell Reinhardt very privately that something might happen. Sure enough, in
                    Vietnam, by this time it was about December 21st or 22nd, the President had the
                    brainstorm of thinking that in the context of Vietnam what could be better than
                    to be in Rome with the Pope on Christmas Eve. Horace Busby and somebody else
                    showed up in Rome and took rooms in the hotel across from the Embassy, where
                    they stayed; no contact. On about the 22nd, I think, they came over and informed
                    the Ambassador that the President had decided to visit the Pope on Christmas Eve
                    and make an appeal for peace in Vietnam, but we were not to say anything to the
                    Italians. I guess at that particular moment both Frank Malloy and Sam Gavin were
                    away and I was sort of sitting in the DCM's office for reasons I am not sure, so
                    I was in that meeting. Reinhardt said, “He can't come to Italy without seeing
                    the President of Italy.” One of them said that he didn't like that at all, he
                    knew Johnson's mind, Johnson wanted to see the Pope, come in and leave.
                    Reinhardt made his point again, it would be a national insult, he could not just
                    come in and go without touching Italian base. One of them said, “I think we have
                    to remember for whom we are working.” Reinhardt said, “I know full well, I do
                    not need to be told, for whom I am working; but he cannot come here without
                    seeing the President of Italy.” “So be it, but do not tell the Italians.” This
                    was at most three days before he was due to arrive.</p>
                <p>Before long, the Italians were on to it themselves, in principle if not in
                    detail; then we were authorized to discuss arrangements. Yes, he would go out to
                    see the President of Italy at his Villa out near Fiumicino. But some of the
                    details, such as where he would land were not to be revealed because a decision
                    had not been made whether he would land at Fiumicino or Ciampino. All the vast
                    machinery was set in place; the White House had sent some White House
                    helicopters to Spain where they awaited orders, a vehicle was to be dropped at
                    the airport, etc. So we began planning; by now it was the 23rd of December and
                    he was due the next day.</p>

                <p>BARBOUR: What happened was that December 24th was a very foggy day in Spain,
                    nothing could take off; no helicopters or aircraft with vehicles or anything
                    else. So we brought some helicopters down from Aviano, American Army helicopters
                    with pilots who had probably never seen Rome before, much less by dark. We
                    staked out some landing grounds up behind St. Peters; did all the things we
                    could, rushing like mad to make the necessary provisions for the visit. I
                    remember, and regret to this day, that a colleague and friend who was working
                    for President Saragat asked, “Tell us what airport he is going to use, for
                    goodness sake.” I said, “I don't know.” And that was a lie; by that time we did
                    know. I always regret that; it is the only time I ever told a colleague anything
                    that wasn't true. I remember it and I still regret it. Anyhow, that afternoon,
                    December 24th, we were told that he would land at Fiumicino and while on the
                    ground he would want his friends to do shopping for him, Christmas presents and
                    things like that. I may be a day late, it may have been December 23rd because I
                    believe it was also my birthday; but during such turmoil and confusion I was not
                    really sure which. The Secret Service came in and together we drove out to a
                    field near the President of Italy's lodge where President Johnson was supposed
                    to land in the helicopters. It was just a field, nothing more; to their great
                    credit the Secret Service just looked at it and said, “Let's hope they don't
                    suck anything up.” So we put some automobiles around with their lights on and
                    the Italians tolled off a couple of battalion helicopters to lead. The President
                    landed, got in the helicopter at Fiumicino with the Chief of Protocol and
                    Ambassador Reinhardt and turned to Reinhardt and the President's Ambassador
                    Orlandi ..?.., a very distinguished man who spoke perfect English, and said to
                    Reinhardt, “I only wanted to come here to see the Pope.” Those were his true
                    feelings, I am sure. They landed out there in total darkness, got down all
                    right, had their meetings, got back on the helicopters to fly to see the Pope.
                    The Italians leading, in to St. Peter's; there was a small field behind the
                    North American College in the Vatican which was the landing site. There were
                    some automobiles with headlights out on this patch of grass which was quite wet
                    because it had been raining. We had somebody from the Embassy out in the middle
                    of it waving a flashlight, that was where they were to touch down. The
                    helicopter with the President in it did go down and as it landed, the ground
                    being so wet, it sank in up to the middle of its wheels. The pilot reported it
                    and the second helicopter said “Not me, I'm not going in there,” and he landed
                    smack in the middle of St. Peter's Square.</p>
                <p>Then while all this was going on the President's friends were buying Christmas
                    presents; paintings—he wanted so many paintings delivered to the airplane to
                    pick from—and jewelry from stores that had to be opened up at 11:00 o'clock on
                    the night of the 23rd. It was just a haze, I can't even remember the dates.
                    Anyhow he left leaving the Italians with a bad taste in their mouth, the Pope
                    unwilling to commit himself to support the American policy in Vietnam. It was a
                    Presidential visit the likes of which, fortunately, I never saw again.</p>

                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: The Italians put the best face on it, as they know how to do better than
                    anyone else in the world and portrayed it as a very successful, pleasant visit
                    between two chiefs of state, after which he also called on the Pope.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Yes, there were a couple of points I wanted to go back to. In 1969 I
                    became head of the political section, working for an amazing Ambassador, highly
                    controversial, about whom, as I once told him, no one has had mixed feelings,
                    they are either very strongly for or very strongly against. That was Graham
                    Martin. Graham Martin had a strength of personality that is very rare in the
                    Foreign Service. He did not hesitate, when he felt strongly enough, to tell a
                    Cabinet Minister that it would not be convenient for him to visit ..?.. at that
                    time, tell another one that if he wanted to come at that time, he, Martin, would
                    not be involved. On another occasion, this is purely anecdotal, after the
                    Agricultural Attach� had been injured in an automobile accident and the medical
                    bills were piling up and were not being paid to the great annoyance of the local
                    hospital—the Department of Agriculture had shilly-shallied—Martin directed the
                    Embassy to pay the bills and charge Agriculture. Then he sent the Secretary of
                    Agriculture a telegram saying, “I have done this and I am sure had you known
                    about it you would have done the same thing.” And the thing was finished. He was
                    an amazing individual.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>As far as that related to me in the political section, there were two things that
                    were significant. One was that we began to have contacts with the MSI, the
                    Italian Socialist movement, the neo-fascists, the Mussolini descendants, who
                    have now more or less gone out of business. Giorgo Almirante was the
                    Secretary-General of that party. They had been wanting to have contacts with the
                    Embassy for some time, but the policy had been that we would not deal with the
                    extreme left, the communists, and we would not deal with the extreme right. In
                    any case, Almirante, through intermediaries, sent word to Martin that he would
                    like to talk to somebody in the Embassy, and Martin, who had a somewhat
                    conspiratorial streak himself said fine. He called me in one day and said, “Mr.
                    So-and-so will be calling you to arrange an appointment for Mr. Almirante and
                    you should see him.” With great trepidation and misgivings I agreed to receive
                    him. We had a chat which I must say I found extremely interesting, refreshing.
                    He was, I guess, in many ways a rascal; he started out in life, as I recall, as
                    a clown in a circus where I think his parents were. I found the conversation
                    refreshing because I had the feeling that he was being completely honest. When I
                    asked if his group was responsible for an incident here, an incident there, he
                    was quite clear. One of them he said, “Well, not really,” another one he said,
                    “No,”, another, “No, that was done by So-and-so,” one was done by his party but
                    he said, “That was a dumb thing to do; I told him not to do it and it won't be
                    repeated.” So I found this kind of candor refreshing and he was also an engaging
                    fellow. He came to the Embassy several times and we had our first meetings with
                    the MSI, and I thought they were quite rewarding. He came to Washington once and
                    asked me to lunch and I told him that I was sorry but I couldn't. He said,
                    “Well, I understand and I will not embarrass you.”</p>
                <p>The other thing of significance was that under Martin we developed a coherent
                    effort with the Christian Democratic Party, to try to get them to clean up their
                    act. Over and over again, every time we met with somebody, on his instructions,
                    we would say, “The DC (Christian Democrats) should stop doing this, get out of
                    this, do so and so, disassociate yourself.” I did this in every meeting I
                    had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say disassociate yourself, disassociate yourself
                        from what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Practices, individuals known to be corrupt—of course we didn't know how
                    corrupt the whole system was at that point, although we were fairly clear that
                    some in the DC were very corrupt. So every meeting I had, at his instructions it
                    was to get across that message, that support from the United States will depend
                    on the Christian Democratic Party improving its stature and its appeal to the
                    voters and that means internal reform. Over and over again. Of course we did it
                    not because we loved the Christian Democrats but because we feared inroads from
                    the left. Obviously a weakened Christian Democratic party meant a weakened
                    bulwark against the communists. So we had this as a coherent program throughout
                    the last couple of years I was there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Graham Martin had the strength of his character but I have
                        always thought of him as being “Louis the XI,” the spider king sitting
                        around there. I would think that as political counselor you would have had a
                        hell of a time knowing what he was doing. I am told that when he came in he
                        would read everything on your desk.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Everything. He was enigmatic; he was disconcerting, he was upsetting, he
                    was all kinds of things because he would roam around. I would be sitting at my
                    desk and he would walk in and sit down beside me and ask, “What are you doing?”
                    Then he would talk, that could be upsetting because he was not the kind of
                    person that you were comfortable with. He was also disconcerting because he
                    didn't sleep much and he would take everything home and read it late at
                    night—the memcoms, the outgoing telegrams, this and that. Maybe three months
                    later he would say, “But that's no what you said in your memcom of three months
                    ago when you said such and such.” It was something that kept one on one's toes.
                    If there was something for him to sign in an outgoing telegram, I would take it
                    in to him, hoping to drop it on his desk and say, “Here's the telegram about
                    so-and-so,” and get out. That rarely happened. He would say, “Sit down.” Then he
                    might put the telegram aside and talk about other things—probe, question,
                    instruct. This was usually at lunch time and sometimes Bob ..?.., who was his
                    staff aide, would bring in his lunch from the cafeteria and Martin would tell
                    him to put it over there and continue. This might go on for another fifteen or
                    twenty minutes, or half an hour, and the lunch was getting cold. I think he only
                    ate lunch to keep alive. He seemed to have no interest in any sort of hedonistic
                    pursuit; he was interested in people and power and zeroed in on them.</p>
                <p>My relationship with him was, I must say, always very friendly. One day as I was
                    about to go off and have lunch with an Under Secretary or somebody, he said, “I
                    want you to tell him,” and he ticked off five points all in the area of what to
                    do within the party to straighten it out. We had lunch, we chatted, in the
                    course of which I made the points, four of them at least. I went back and was
                    writing my memcom when word came that the Ambassador wanted to see me. So I went
                    in and he said, “Tell me about your lunch.” So I did. “Did you tell him a, b, c,
                    d?” “Yes sir.” “Did you tell him e?” “No sir.” He bridled, it got very cool,
                    very frosty, which came quite easily to him. “Why not?” I took a deep gulp and
                    said, “I forgot.” And he laughed, to my astonishment. He said, “I was afraid you
                    simply decided not to do what I told you to do.” Well that was a great
                    lesson.</p>
                <p>Vis-a-vis the Christian Democratic Party, we became quite close to some of the
                    reformers and were helpful to them. Some of the mavericks who were trying to do
                    some dramatic things in the way of reform. Throwing out the old leadership, for
                    example. We were quite sympathetic to them and helped them as much as we
                    could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the light of later and previous experience, did you
                        find that Graham Martin had power in the Congress or the State Department
                        that meant he could do his own thing more than others?</hi>

                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: When the telegram came back from the Secretary of Agriculture about
                    paying the Agricultural Attach�'s bill, it said exactly what it would have said
                    if he had written it himself—”Thank you for your message, I appreciate what you
                    have done; you were quite right.” I said to Martin, “Well, you have won another
                    one.” He looked up with those steel gray eyes of his and said, “I don't go into
                    these to lose.” Another day—these conversations at lunch were frequently on how
                    to be a successful Ambassador, why he was a successful Ambassador. It was not
                    focused on him, just his thoughts, lots of rumination about how he should have
                    been doing then what you're doing now. He took on people at any level because he
                    worked for the President, the Secretary of State was an intermediary; he worked
                    for the President, he was the President's representative. I forget the
                    observation I made, something about going to the mat on issues and he said, “I
                    don't really like these fights, but people think I do and therefore I don't lose
                    very many.” So these were all lessons in the exercise of power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As long as we are on Graham Martin, were there any things
                        that you carried over in your later career that you found were lessons
                        learned from Graham Martin.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Subconsciously I suppose. I never thought before doing something how
                    Graham Martin would have done something. The person I asked myself about most
                    was Frank Malloy, how he would have handled it, because he handled the most
                    difficult situations with great finesse and they always seemed to come out
                    exactly the way he wanted them to with no breakage. With Martin it was things
                    like before you do anything you have to get your facts right, be sure of your
                    ground, and if you are sure of your ground don't run away from it. I guess
                    that's the basic message. Don't pick fights unnecessarily, but if you're sure,
                    go ahead. I would never have the chutzpah to take a sledge hammer to a cabinet
                    secretary the way he would not hesitate to do. I think I may have told you the
                    story about when the Vice President came to Bangkok. Johnson was Vice President
                    and he gave a State dinner and the question was the Vice President's return
                    toast. Martin said that he would give it as he was the representative of the
                    President.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>In Rome he did not have much respect for the Secretary of State, Mr. Rogers,
                    because he was not a power wielder. The power in the administration in foreign
                    affairs Martin quickly perceived, and this was very early on, was Henry
                    Kissinger. So when Rogers came with Nixon the first time, he invited the
                    Secretary to stay at the residence—maybe it was just the Secretary alone. A
                    couple of days before the visit Martin went home and found people stringing
                    wires in the residence. He asked what that was all about and was told they were
                    putting in this and that for the Secretary. Martin said, “No, this is my house,
                    he is my guest and there will be no stringing of wires in my house. If he is not
                    comfortable here he is welcome to stay in a hotel.” Which he did, Rogers did. On
                    another occasion during a Nixon visit the Secretary rode in a car with Martin
                    and Mrs. Rogers rode in a separate car with Mrs. Martin. At the airport the car
                    drove up and the right hand door in the rear opened and the Secretary got in and
                    sat on the right side. Martin hesitated a moment and did not go around, he
                    climbed over him. The next time the car drove up and the right rear door opened,
                    Martin was already in the seat and he did not budge. Ditto for Mrs. Martin and
                    Mrs. Rogers. My wife and I went along with them for a sightseeing trip, when we
                    pulled up to something to see Mrs. Martin stayed in the car, on the right side,
                    and Mrs. Rogers got out on the left. That was his way of showing his, what he
                    would call, proper seniority; he, I think, took pleasure in embarrassing the
                    Secretary of State for whom he did not have a lot of respect. It was too bad, we
                    all sympathized with the Secretary and Mrs. Rogers who did not bat an eye but
                    must have been seething inside.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see at that time any connections between Kissinger
                        and Graham Martin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: No.</p>

                        found no one to talk to there. It was sort of a collegial type government
                        which was friendly but that was all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: To jump ahead, he had a lot of respect for Graham Martin. He obviously
                    admired somebody who could be as ruthless in the exercise of power as he could
                    be. When the time came in 1973 to change Ambassadors in Vietnam, Kissinger, who
                    was National Security Advisor, said in a meeting apropos of the Ambassador,
                    “Let's send that cold-eyed fellow, Graham Martin.” And indeed, as I told you,
                    his eyes were like steel. I liked him, he was always very courteous to me and my
                    wife, very warm; I have very fond memories of him but I also have memories of a
                    good deal of trepidation every time I was summoned into his presence. It was
                    always, now what have I done wrong. My relationship with him was instructive,
                    entertaining, amazing—I couldn't believe some of the things he used to do as
                    Ambassador.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: No, the one who bore the brunt of it was the DCM, Wells Stabler, who had
                    a difficult job at times running the Embassy because he didn't know what the
                    Ambassador had done or said or wanted. Their relationship was not very

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I went to the Royal College of Defense Studies in London, the former
                    Imperial Defense College, for exactly one calendar year, from January 1972 to
                    January 1973. It was a very stimulating, a very stimulating year, extremely
                    agreeable and intellectually rewarding. Probably one of the most agreeable years
                    I had in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was mainly British military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Yes, we were approximately sixty in the class. Of that sixty probably
                    forty were British military from all the services, some civil servants, one or
                    two foreign office, other ministries; the rest were non-British from the
                    Commonwealth—New Zealand, Australia, Nigeria, Ghana—some non-Commonwealth—Iran,
                    Greece, other NATO, Belgium, four Americans, three uniformed and one not. It was
                    a small group; I was number fifty-five, almost at the end. We met for lecture
                    usually at ten o'clock in the morning, a nice hour to begin. The course year was
                    divided into British institutions, economic policies, world trends and
                    strategies. The purpose was to take the up and coming British officer, they were
                    mostly brigadiers, who were going on to other things and get them out of the
                    trenches, so to speak. Most of them had public school backgrounds, public school
                    and academy, but not university. Amazingly well informed in certain
                    areas—imagine these rough and tumble brigadiers writing messages in Greek back
                    and forth, quoting in Latin. Very articulate but largely unread after a certain
                    level. For two years they had had a civilian intellectual, well known, son of
                    the author of The Thirty-Nine Steps...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Buchan.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: Buchan. Alastair Buchan had been the commandant, the first civilian, and
                    he had applied to the college the intellectual strictures of the university.
                    That had caused enormous unrest among these people who were much more accustomed
                    to doing war games and maneuvers and fighting, I suppose, than they were to
                    reading and especially writing a paper. Even more so to writing a paper that had
                    to be of publishable quality. So after two years of Mr. Buchan they went to the
                    other extreme and put in as commandant a four-star Army general, a soldier
                    through and through, General Sir Merlin Butler. “Tubby” he was known as, not to
                    his face, who was a soldier's soldier. Three martinis before lunch with his men;
                    if he didn't like the lecture he would get up and walk out. So it was a totally
                    different kind of environment. We were a mixed group. After our lecture we would
                    break into syndicates to work on projects; each syndicate had a rapporteur and
                    he reported to your colleagues in groups of six or eight whatever your project
                    was. I think it was really an oral essay, which would then be discussed.
                    Stimulating, especially if you didn't know anything about the subject. I was the
                    rapporteur for the group on “The Role of Sterling as a Reserve Currency.” I
                    hadn't the slightest idea what the role of sterling was as a reserve currency,
                    but I was the rapporteur so I did the report on it. It was a year like that.</p>
                <p>And we took trips, an industrial tour of Scotland—the only time in my life that I
                    went down into a coal mine—we visited the service academies, visited ships at
                    sea, did a buoy transfer from a frigate to a LSD and crossed the choppy channel,
                    we visited the BAR in Northern Germany (the British Army of the Rhine) where
                    they did various exercises for us. I was standing next to an Australian navy
                    captain as the troops were doing a gun drill. I said, “What happens if they drop
                    one,” and he said, “You don't see it.” Then Berlin and the British forces there.
                    Then a five week tour that we could pick ourselves—South America, North America,
                    Western Europe, Far East—I choose the Eastern Mediterranean. We spent a week—we
                    had our own rather small aircraft—in Cyprus, Israel, Jordan, Turkey and Romania,
                    in all those places the guest of the local armed forces. Fascinating! So it was
                    an exciting and stimulating year. I wrote a paper, my paper that I had to turn
                    in at the end called “Europe and the United States: Unity Versus Alliance?”
                    which they published to my great pleasure.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>The thing that really bothered me though, that I found worrisome, was that they
                    had to write an evaluation on every student. The Brits have the inconvenient
                    tradition of writing honest evaluations, they can say critical things and at
                    that time they could say critical things about one's wife. They didn't hesitate:
                    Mr. Jones cannot spell, Mr. Jones writes very badly, Mr. Jones's tie is always
                    crooked. They could say whatever they thought relevant to his career prospects,
                    but it would not be damaging to the extent it is in ours. If Mr. Smith is a
                    promising candidate but cannot spell he would be yanked out and taught to spell
                    and put back into the stream to go on. So the thought of them writing a candid
                    evaluation of their American student was not something I welcomed; I much would
                    have preferred that they write an American style one. The fact that I sometimes
                    didn't make it to the morning lecture before 10:10, as the commandant remarked
                    one day when I arrived, I thought might be something that they would choose to
                    observe. But they didn't; it worked out okay. Nonetheless, that was always a
                    little cloud on the horizon. Fortunately they were not as honest as they might
                    have been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a British military mindset that you found
                        interesting or that gave you help later on in understanding how another
                        power looks at things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: One thing was that I did not really know what a class society the
                    British society is. The group I was with was a class group; they represented a
                    certain class. Some of them represented a higher element within it, very society
                    oriented, but those who came from working class backgrounds were no longer
                    working class. One with whom I became very good friends, an admiral, was born
                    into a very poor family but somehow a wealthy man took an interest in him as a
                    boy and saw to it that he went to a good public school. The result was that when
                    he left there with the right accent, the right education, the right formation,
                    he was more or less alienated from his family, they no longer spoke the same
                    language. The other thing was that these were people who had a very broad
                    perspective, they could converse, and they did converse, some of them quite
                    eloquently, on the subjects of interest to them. Although I said that they
                    didn't read after a certain period they had enough of a basic culture, a deep
                    and very broad cultural endowment, so that they were very impressive
                    individuals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they view the United States and our role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: So far as I could tell the United States was for them a given, their
                    closest ally, a country with which they were accustomed to working, some had
                    been on exchange programs and in joint headquarters. We were a given; I did not
                    detect any time snide remarks. We were viewed as a friend and ally.</p>

                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: Oh yes, that was a factor. It was the obvious and common enemy. But the
                    course did not focus on the Soviet Union, it was much broader than that. This
                    period of world problems and strategies, whatever it was called, was a very
                    broad one; I remember we had one week devoted to Southern Africa. Another one on
                    the Middle East in which our Iranian General, in the midst of a briefing we were
                    having at Channel Command Headquarters, a very distinguished group of three and
                    four star British officers, got up and said, “It is not the gulf, it is the
                    Persian Gulf.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you left there and came back to Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Yes, to be Director of the Office of Iberian Affairs. I went in to see
                    Joan Clark, the Executive Director for EUR, on my first day there and she asked,
                    “Have you heard what is happening to you?” My first reaction was Vietnam, but I
                    said that I hadn't heard. “You are being considered for special assistant to the
                    new Under Secretary.” I said then, and maintained throughout, that I would
                    rather be office director for Iberian Affairs. It didn't turn out that way. I
                    made clear to Ambassador Porter when I met with him a couple of times...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was which Porter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: William J. Porter. I made clear that I was quite happy at the prospect
                    of staying in EUR, that he needn't think I was looking for a job. I told Walter
                    Stoessel, who was the Assistant Secretary who kept the Iberian job open for me
                    for some time, that I hoped he would arrange for me to remain with him. In my
                    last meeting I said to Ambassador Porter, whom I did not know at all, as he sat
                    behind his desk looking over his glasses, “I hope you understand that I am
                    really quite content to remain in EUR, but if you want me to come here, of
                    course I will.” He said, “Well, I do.” That was that. I moved up to work with
                    him for almost exactly a calendar year; he was a wonderful man, what a
                    stimulating year. He died a few years ago; I have nothing but admiration and
                    respect and great affection for him as a diplomat and a human being.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Under Secretary operate in those days, we are
                        talking about 1973?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: He was essentially what he still is, Under Secretary for Political
                    Affairs.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Porter operate in that job?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: Seventh floor at that time consisted of Rogers as Secretary, Kenneth
                    Rush, Deputy Secretary, Porter, Under Secretary for Political Affairs and Bill
                    Casey, Under Secretary for Economic Affairs. Porter took to that job his well
                    known credentials for candor, one hundred and fifty percent intellectual
                    honesty, moral courage, delightful sense of humor, a great facility for writing
                    which was amazing because he was not a college graduate. I think he had never
                    even gone to college, he was largely self-educated. Brought up by his widowed
                    mother who had immigrated from England, raised in Boston. He was a self-made
                    man, a wonderful person. How did he operate? The way they do now, I think.</p>

                <p>BARBOUR: No, Kissinger was still National Security Advisor in the White

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: It was very awkward. Rogers was the Secretary of State; he was a
                    distinguished, honorable, honest man who took an interest in the Foreign
                    Service. But he was in the position of being constantly embarrassed and
                    humiliated by Kissinger. Things that Kissinger in his book acknowledges and
                    regrets, but admits that he treated Rogers very badly. Rogers was constantly
                    being cut off. I remember when I was in London we watched the Nixon visit to
                    Beijing on television, this was 1972, and I noticed that in the meeting with Mao
                    Rogers was not present; it was just the President and Kissinger. I told my mates
                    at that time that if I were Secretary of State under those circumstances, I
                    would resign. But he kept going and frequently unburdened himself to Porter.
                    Porter was an individual who needed no external props but did like to have
                    somebody to talk to and I was that person, I guess. We developed a very close
                    relationship; although I had his confidence, he left a lot of things to me, I
                    never ever interposed myself between his staff, which was the Department of
                    State, and him. It is a great mistake to try and take decisions that need to be
                    taken later on. Since he wanted someone to talk to, he would frequently come
                    back and talk about his meetings with the Secretary and what the Secretary had
                    told him, especially after an episode.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>Porter himself dealt with Kissinger because Kissinger as National Security
                    Advisor did not rank as cabinet level and frequently dealt with Porter. Porter
                    would represent the Department at meetings with Kissinger; he dreaded them, he
                    hated them because he found it impossible not to express his opinion if he
                    disagreed. Kissinger did not appreciate it. He would come back from meetings at
                    the White House and I would ask, “How was the meeting? How was Kissinger today?”
                    And he would say, “Vile.” But Kissinger respected him; he may have disliked
                    having him around but he did respect him and showed it. You could be at outs
                    with Kissinger in a number of ways, but if you were at outs and he didn't
                    respect you, you were gone, if you were at outs and he did respect you, you were
                    taken care of, as was proven later. Porter was very loyal to the Secretary; he
                    tried to serve him, he tried to encourage him, he tried to support him. His job
                    was to try and support the Secretary of State in his relations with Kissinger.
                    And he did, which of course put him in a difficult situation at times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why do you think Secretary Rogers put up with this? From
                        all accounts he was a very honorable man and a fine man. There reaches a
                        point where ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Well, who knows. I think one reason was that Rogers was a personal
                    friend of Nixon and his first relations with Nixon as President were probably
                    cordial and constructive. So there was that; he was on old personal friend of
                    Nixon, had been his Attorney General, you remember. The other thing must be that
                    he did like the office. He did at one time set in motion a kind of peace process
                    in the Middle East which looked promising for a brief period. So I guess he
                    liked the office and he was in the end, you know, dismissed. After the
                    appointment of Kissinger as Secretary it was quite obvious that there were going
                    to be a lot of changes but no one knew what they were. I was walking down to the
                    Under Secretary's suite, down the main corridor, one day and I saw General Haig
                    sitting in the Secretary's private waiting room and I asked Porter, “What is
                    Haig doing in the Secretary's office?” He didn't know. Well what he was doing
                    was asking for his resignation.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>Kissinger came over, I think this was in August of 1973, and we knew the good
                    days were past. So little by little he began to make changes, announced in his
                    press conferences, and that is how those affected knew of them, whether they
                    were in or out. It happened that by the end of the year, and I don't remember if
                    this was his first press conference, he wanted Joe Sisco to be his Under
                    Secretary, but he wouldn't tell him and he wouldn't appoint him. Sisco, at that
                    time the head of NEA (Near Eastern Affairs) and who had been on the receiving
                    end of countless gibes and barbs from Porter asking awkward questions about
                    Middle Eastern affairs, desperately wanted the job but was not certain he was
                    going to get it. So Joe Sisco, who had been a player in Washington for a long
                    time, announced that he had accepted the Presidency of a small college—that was
                    to force Kissinger's hand. Finally Kissinger called Porter and explained that he
                    had to have Joe Sisco. This was after... Porter one day called to see Ken Rush
                    and came back and called me in and said, “You know I always said I would never
                    take another Embassy, that there was only one that I really wanted because it
                    was close to home. That's Canada and I have been offered it and I told them I
                    would take it.” It was only after that that Kissinger told him that he had to
                    have Joe Sisco for Middle Eastern affairs because of his close personal
                    relationship. So that is how Porter left and went to Canada.</p>
                <p>He was a man of such integrity, the barbs he used to send Joe Sisco were awkward
                    because Porter knew a lot about the Middle East. He spoke Arabic and seemed to
                    have an affinity for dealing with people there. The incoming telegrams from
                    various places frequently cropped up in his little notes, and then I would have
                    to take them to Sisco. The messenger was as much the problem in Sisco's eyes as
                    the originator. I remember one of the issues concerned arms for the Shah. The
                    Shah had an insatiable appetite for state of the art weapons. In one telegram he
                    explained that he had to have more Phantom F-4's because of their long legs.
                    Porter penciled in the side of this thing that I was to take down to Sisco, “and
                    what are these long legs for?” Meaning, other countries in the Persian Gulf. So
                    he ruled up there briefly but candidly. The meetings in Porter's office never
                    went more than twenty minutes. They were usually problem solving; each party to
                    the problem would state its case, there would be a discussion and Porter would
                    decide. At the end of twenty minutes he would grow very restless and meetings
                    didn't go on. I remember one day there was a proposal that would involve an
                    Embassy officer working for somebody else, he would perform a function in a role
                    that was not part of the diplomatic post, as somebody else. The Agency wanted
                    this fellow to do something for them. They came over, I forget whether it was
                    Bill Colby who knew and liked Porter, and they made their proposal and Porter
                    heard the Assistant Secretary who was more or less in support of it; both of
                    them urged him to agree.Porter paused about one millimeter of a second and said,
                    “It stinks. The answer is no.” He was right I think. That is the way he
                    conducted business. “Let's get on with it,” he would say; decisions were not
                    things that he shied away from even when he knew they were going to be
                    unpopular.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the matter of arms for the Shah of Iran. It
                        seems that Nixon and Kissinger absolutely collapsed in front of the Shah.
                        Whatever you want, you can have; with lots of repercussions later on. We put
                        too many American personnel in there; the whole thing was
                        destabilizing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Porter, of course, was not hostile to the Shah but he constantly
                    questioned why we were building him up, why we were encouraging his external
                    ambitions. He thought that...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, we were just mentioning in the last part about

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Well, of course, reservations arose from the external aspects. We did
                    not see why Iran needed such a large strategic capability. That was his constant
                    quibble, I'd say. Also, he thought that some of the people who were dealing with
                    Middle Eastern affairs, didn't know anything about the Middle East. Each episode
                    was an opening for his sharp pen. His observations were quite acute.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, Joe Sisco did a lot in the Middle East, but he

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: He knew how to muster Washington behind the policy, I suppose.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did Porter think about, I mean getting away from the
                        personalities, what did he think about Nixon and Kissinger? They played a
                        very active role in the foreign policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Kissinger pressed onward because Kissinger was constantly cutting across
                    lines, in wanting to give instructions to the Department. I remember I was in
                    Porter's office one day when Kissinger called, I forget what the subject was,
                    but Porter disagreed, and said so. The conversation was, “No, Henry, no I don't
                    think so. No, I just don't agree, I don't think that's the right way. No, I
                    wouldn't do that.” Of course, those were not the kinds of responses that
                    Kissinger wanted or liked. They did, as I said, command respect. To be sure,
                    when the time came to move Porter, and out he was moved, it was done with a
                    certain amount of grace, far more than was true in other cases.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When Porter left, did you leave too?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: No, that conversation where he said that he had been offered the one
                    post that he had agreed to take, by saying, “Well, how about it Bob, want to go
                    to Canada?” And I didn't answer. I changed the subject, because, I didn't. Then
                    it came up again a few days later, “Want to go?” And I ducked. We had been to
                    Canada because of the Vietnam conflict which was still going on, Canada was the
                    key player in the international They were wavering, whether they should do it.
                    So Porter and I flew up to Ottawa, and met with Michael Sharp, I think his name
                    was, the Canadian Foreign Minister. Late one night, almost at midnight in his
                    little office in the Department and he discussed Vietnam, and we went back to
                    the DCM's house, his name was Johnson, and I used his little typewriter and did
                    the memcon right there that night, and the next morning flew back to the
                    Department. I did Porter's memo to the President saying we had the clear
                    impression the Canadians were going to pull out. In Fact, about three weeks
                    later they announced they were pulling out. Your question was how he related to,
                    that was an aside.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: He was on board, so to speak, on all those policies, he was a very loyal
                    supporter of the policies. It was his loyalty that caused him to be so
                    forthright when he thought they were wrong. He did not criticize personally
                    either Nixon or Kissinger, unless he thought Kissinger got out of line. But his
                    problem came in being caught in the middle, which he sometimes was. He had the
                    great personal strength of leaving every night at 7:00, which was not well
                    viewed outside the Department. I remember a number of times as I was clearing up
                    after him, at 7:15 or 7:30, Scowcroft would call, Colby would call wanting to
                    speak to him and he wasn't there. He was a loyal servant of the crown, so to
                    speak, but frequently in a difficult position.</p>

                    done was to get him to agree that I wouldn't have to stay there more than a
                    year. And at the end of a year to the day I went up to see him—no, it was about
                    three weeks before, and said I'd like to leave, and I had arranged to be DCM in
                    Beirut under Mac Godley who had called me a year earlier. Nat Davis was
                    astonished, but he kept his promise, agreed and let me depart.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: It was with the departure of Ambassador Porter as Under Secretary for
                    Political Affairs which was at the beginning about March as I recall, 1974. At
                    that time Nat Davis was Director General. Have we done that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we've done that. We're up to around 1972, I think.
                        What were you doing in Personnel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I went there as director of performance evaluation. Everyone is supposed
                    to spend some time in management, and he asked me to go into that job because he
                    wanted to try desperately to improve the evaluation system in the Foreign
                    Service. As everyone knows it is the paper record that is the least reliable.
                    It's the oral reputation that counts, and he had hoped that we would be able to
                    introduce a greater degree of candor into it. Also, at that time, the selection
                    boards had slipped for several years and promotion lists were coming out about
                    two years later than they previously had. So his objective was to try to improve
                    the evaluation process, and mine was to try to get the boards back on schedule.
                    Not a world shaking situation except for me personally it was the first real
                    management experience I had ever had after even then 25 years in the Foreign
                    Service I had never managed anything of any consequence except one very small
                    post. But it was interesting in that the office was made up of Civil Service
                    permanent employees, and Foreign Service officers. There's a very different
                    psychology, at least there was at that time, between the two, at least as I saw
                    it. Civil Service employees are very good people, knew their jobs, and worked at
                    that time from 8:45 to 5:30. The Foreign Service concept was you came in and
                    stayed until you did your job, and then went home. Anyhow, it was a problem of
                    welding the two components together, trying to put something better into
                    evaluation system then existed, which we did by revising the form and put in at
                    that time that the famous or infamous paragraph 4-C, which still exists, of
                    areas for improvement. Not a giant step forward.</p>

                    criticize an officer without damaging him. I thought maybe it would be nice to
                    introduce something like that into the Foreign Service system. As I said, it
                    hasn't had a dramatic input, so to speak, but it's still there. The idea is that
                    somebody will once in a while be honest, and say that this officer is an
                    excellent officer with great potential, but he does need to improve his writing,
                    or the way he deals with people, or timeliness, or something like that. Once in
                    a while they do that, and once in a while it has the desired effect. The officer
                    improves, and goes on about his business, and his career.</p>
                <p>We also added the rebuttal invitation with a somewhat Machiavellian purpose on
                    the one hand to give an officer who was criticized a chance to rebut the
                    criticism if he chose to do so, and sometimes they do it very well. But we
                    removed the length that the permitted statement, which meant that an officer who
                    felt very strongly could write on page after page after page if he or she so
                    chose, and such a response would be very revealing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way it's considered by many to be a trap.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I don't want to use that word, but in fact a fervent rebuttal that goes
                    on page after page after page, is not to the credit of the individual who
                    engages in it. And that was the intent. If the rating officer said this
                    individual has a problem getting along with people, and the rated officer then
                    takes five pages to explain why that is not at all true, we've accomplished our
                    purpose. That's still there. But it was not a great year, for me personally it
                    was very good managerial experience. We did conclude the boards two months ahead
                    of the previous year, got them back on schedule, and I did thereupon departed
                    Personnel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you then went to European Affairs where you served from
                        '75 to '78. What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: Well, in fact, there's one little diversion that I want to mention. One
                    of the few wise things I've done in this business, is to get Nat Davis to agree
                    that I would stay only one year in that job in Personnel, and go on to something
                    else. At the end of the year I told him I wanted to leave. He was astonished,
                    but I telephoned Mac Godley in Beirut who was still without a DCM, and he said,
                    “Yes, by all means come.” So I intended to do so, but various friends kept
                    telling me not to go to Beirut. Not because of Ambassador Godley who is a
                    splendid person, but they said Beirut, and particularly true of David Korn, who
                    I must say a precinct, “Beirut is going to be by the end of next year our worst
                    Middle East problem. Beirut is going to go up in flames, and there's going to be
                    all kinds of crises there.” At the same time the European Bureau was very
                    anxious for me to come back, as director for Western European Affairs, which is
                    something I wanted very much to do.</p>
                <p>But to make a long story short, Mac Godley left, he was replaced by Frank Meloy,
                    an old old friend whose DCM I would have enjoyed being. But after I'd been back
                    in European Affairs for a while, Frank Meloy was assassinated along with his
                    DCM. I guess, had I been there, I would have been that unfortunate DCM. So, I
                    didn't go. Godley left shortly thereafter anyway. I went back to the Bureau of
                    European Affairs as Director for Western Europe quite happily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the main concerns in this '75 to '78 period for
                        Western European Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: The Office of Western European Affairs, somewhat misleading of course,
                    because we didn't have all of western Europe by any means. We had only France,
                    Italy, Malta and the Benelux countries. The main concern at that time—there were
                    two, one was France cooperation, or lack thereof, and Italy the nature and
                    stability of the Christian Democratic Government. France, at that time with
                    Giscard d'Estaing as President, was once again asserting itself in ways that we
                    found uncomfortable. I remember the first issue that came up while I was there
                    was the IAEA, the site of the IAEA. Anyhow, it was a great problem.
                    International Atomic Energy Agency, now in Vienna. It was a problem, somewhat
                    technical, intensely political as everything else was. And that was my prelude
                    to my return to Western European Affairs.</p>
                <p>In Italy the government of then...I forget whether it was Aldo or T___ Moro, but
                    they came and they went all in the same family, as you know. It was always a
                    question for us of the extent to which they would coopt the Communist Party and
                    increasingly legitimize it, or sprinkle it with their own version of holy water.
                    As it turns out they were doing so to a much greater degree than anybody knew,
                    but that's a different story.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just a question on Italy at that time because we're now
                        having this discussion in 1994, and the corruption of the Christian
                        Democratic Party became a major issue and caused sort of an earthquake in
                        the Italian political affairs just last year or so. Was corruption of the
                        Christian Democrats at all a concern, or not at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: It was a concern then and within the next couple of years it became a
                    much greater, and more pressing concern. But there was corruption in the sense
                    of not payoffs and things like that although everybody knew about, gave them an
                    envelope and that took care of it. We did not know the extent to which that was
                    being engaged in as a macro level by the party secretaries. There were always
                    rumors of this. Of course, every party had its payoff. [A payoff] was the
                    Socialist bank according to them, and other main and major banks who were tied
                    in with the Christian Democrats, they each had its television channel. It was a
                    kind of apportioning of the publicly controlled entities among the parties, more
                    from the Socialists than into the right. We didn't know the communists were
                    officially and structurally part of that as well. But it was always a problem
                    with Italy, and of course we wanted to be nice to the Italians. They are and
                    always have been very faithful allies, but sometimes we felt there were a lot of
                    things we could not give them, participation support, etc. So it was always this
                    kind of very friendly relationship, with a certain amount of game playing on
                    their part, and our trying more or less to be responsive on our side. The big
                    factor was that the then ambassador, Volpe, enjoyed the favor of Henry Kissinger
                    who was Secretary of State, was very close to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: John A. Volpe, he then had his residence on Sixteenth Street, across
                    from Spanish embassy. Kissinger liked him and the relationship was good. Of
                    course, that made life much easier at the desk level. The French ambassador, who
                    did not have the personality of some of his predecessors, and therefore didn't
                    use his job the way some of his predecessors had, didn't have the access of some
                    of his predecessors. But relations were reasonably tranquil, and it was just a
                    tremendous job of managing the conduct of business, the day-to-day business with
                    those countries with whom the volume of business was enormous.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>And then we had the Benelux countries, my first experience with them. The Dutch
                    ambassador, very well known in the Dutch diplomatic service, an intellectual,
                    not an easy person to get along with. His staff and his colleagues viewed him
                    with awe. As I recall he'd been in Moscow and went from here to Paris. But a
                    very senior, a very prestigious member of the Dutch diplomatic establishment. My
                    introduction to dealing with the Dutch made much more of an impact in return
                    than dealing with things French and Italian. I remember well the first time I
                    called as office director, and went out to call on the Dutch Ambassador. He'd
                    see me very courteously, very cordially, and after about five minutes he said,
                    “Tell me, what would you think if a foreign government invited a cabinet member
                    from the United States to visit its capital, and then refused to receive him?” I
                    was, needless to say, somewhat taken aback. I really wasn't sure what he was
                    talking about. It turned out that we had in Washington a junior minister from
                    the Dutch cabinet who had invited himself to Washington, and was unsuccessfully
                    busy trying to get in to see people at the cabinet level. He was minister for
                    cooperation, I think, and we thought that's the director of AID, go see the
                    director of AID, that's that. No sir, he wanted to see the Secretary of State,
                    and the Secretary of Treasury, and wasn't getting very far. So that's what it
                    turned out...he'd not been invited, he was not a senior member, and the Dutch
                    ambassador was trying very hard to push his case. I did finally succeed in
                    getting him an appointment with the Deputy Secretary, and it was memorable
                    conversation because of the three countries in the world who are given to
                    lecturing—the first, I guess, are the Indians, the next two are the United
                    States, and third is the Benelux.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would put the Canadians probably.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Oh, really. I don't know, I haven't dealt with the Canadians. Anyhow,
                    the meeting with the Deputy Secretary was one in which this junior minister
                    proceeded to lecture him. So that was my dealings with the Dutch. Anyhow, it was
                    fun while it lasted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A question about France. Was it sort of the attitude, the
                        French are going to go their own way, if the chips are down they'll be on
                        our side if we really need them. I mean, just sort of shrug your shoulders
                        and say, viva la French. Was that the attitude?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: It was an ambivalent relationship, and very strong in both directions. I
                    don't recall specific issues in those early days, but French cooperation in
                    public forum could never be assumed, or at least it would be grudging, or at
                    least there would be a price for it. It was just in the nature of things French
                    at that time. On the other hand, Henry Kissinger kept in very close personal
                    contact using channels that did not go through the bureau of European Affairs,
                    and I assume Art Hartman was aware of what was going on, but I'm not
                    certain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Art Hartman was...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: ...the Assistant Secretary. Those transactions which were extensive,
                    were rather intimate. Not necessarily warmly cordial, but they were very candid,
                    they were very frank, and they were conducted on the basis between colleagues.
                    As I recall, Jabore, was the Foreign Minister when I started. Jabore was a very
                    prickly person, rather to the left of the French establishment—well, no, I take
                    that back. He was paradoxical, not at all fond of the United States. Whether he
                    was a left Gaullist or just a pure Gaullist, I'm not sure, I don't recall, but
                    he was always difficult for us to deal with. Always seemed to go out of his way
                    to have something uncomplimentary to say. So relations with France were
                    extensive, intensive, and sometimes problematical. But I don't remember any
                    specific issues that came up in the way of crisis at that time. I remember much
                    more in dealing with the Dutch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At a certain point you became the Deputy Assistant
                        Secretary for Western and Southern Europe, basically just more
                        responsibility but within the same framework that you'd been dealing with
                        before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: In the meantime the Office of Western European Affairs had undergone a
                    change. With the revolution in Portugal in the spring of 1975...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this within your province?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: No, it was not, but two things were going on in the Office of Liberian
                    Affairs. One was we were renegotiating a base agreement, another was that
                    Portugal underwent a dramatic, if bloodless, revolution in the hands of people
                    who wanted to move it very far left. People who were, as it turned out, much
                    more harmless than they seemed, but they seemed at the time to be almost fuzzy
                    Maoist in the things they said, and the things they said they wanted to do.
                    Anyhow, it was a major crisis for us, that Portugal was a major crisis for us.
                    That office was overwhelmed. At the same time we were negotiating a base
                    agreement in Spain that was not going extremely well, and there were an awful
                    lot of leaks coming out of the American delegation and being printed in the
                    American newspapers. The result was, they decided to incorporate Spain and
                    Portugal into the Office of Western European Affairs, and I gave up Benelux. So
                    Spain and Portugal came onto my particular scene, and demanded far more time in
                    those days than France and Italy had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From interviews, and almost corridor talk, but one of the
                        great stories of the Foreign Service of this period, was this whole
                        Portuguese thing, where you had the Secretary of State and a very active
                        ambassador, Frank Carlucci was sent out there, who were quite in
                        disagreement on how to go. Could you talk about what you saw, both when you
                        dealing actively with it, and also from the sidelines about this.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: Portugal was generating a lot of anguish in Washington. Frank Carlucci
                    went out, was there when Portugal and Spain came into Western European Affairs.
                    I had never met him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was basically sent out to replace what was considered a
                        sort of weak team out there, if I recall. I think we had a political
                        ambassador, and a DCM who was not very strong.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: We were taken by surprise. Of course, they weren't the only ones. CIA
                    was just about to close its office at that very time, saying nothing here is
                    going to happen, its not worth it. Frank came over from HEW where he was Under
                    Secretary, I think, and went out to Lisbon. A lot had transpired when I came
                    onto the scene, I had never met him. But it is true that he and Kissinger saw
                    things differently. Carlucci's position was more or less, ride it out. Ride it
                    out, don't over react, it may not be as bad as it looks as though its going to
                    be. That was the position he had taken before I came on that scene, so I hope
                    I'm doing him justice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was my understanding, that Kissinger at least
                        verbally was making all sorts of threats. I mean not what we could do, but
                        we were huffing and puffing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: We were quite worried because all the things they were saying, it was
                    wild and woolly leftist stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were young officers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: These were young officers, headed by...I've forgotten their names. Then
                    you had the Portuguese communist party which had been I guess illegal for a long
                    time, certainly prominent on the scene in the hands of a real Stalinist who made
                    no bones about it. I don't mean communist, Stalinist, he went down being a
                    Stalinist and he's still alive today, I'm sure he still is the last one in
                    Europe.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>In the meantime, the Azores were giving us lots and lots of concern because of an
                    Azorean independence movement. It wanted to break away from pro-communist
                    Portugal and attach themselves to the United States, or at least under the
                    American umbrella. And it wasn't only awkward politically, but we had an
                    important base in the Azores, Terciera Island, the largest. And the Azorean
                    movement was to some degree financed by wealthy Portuguese Americans. So they
                    were saying things that caused some people to bite their fingernails, and the
                    revolutionaries in Portugal were saying other things, remove the rest of the
                    fingernails, or generate other kinds of worries. Anyhow, Frank was there and not
                    on the same wave length with Kissinger. So he came back on consultation, I'd
                    been in the job briefly, and Frank came home on Sunday night. I shall never
                    forget meeting him at National Airport. My introduction to Frank was, that he
                    had lost his credit card and had to pay for something at the airport, so I lent
                    him my Visa card, and I had the job of telling him the Secretary wanted to see
                    him Monday morning, and he was mad at him. Oh well, Frank is not bothered by
                    that.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, the revolution continued for a while, and then gradually the leadership
                    changed and appeared to become less inflammatory, but still revolutionary.
                    Abolishing this, and abolishing that, and instituting this, and instituting
                    that. I don't remember the many, many details of every day life with the
                    Portuguese revolution. But I do know that in time it became less inflammatory.
                    The first leader to come here, I think, was a Major, who came to Washington and
                    was received by Kissinger, received suitably. They had a long conversation, and
                    then at the end of the meeting met privately.</p>
                <p>Carlucci meanwhile had reached out to these people, and had developed all kinds
                    of contacts with them. I don't mean that he was sympathizing with them, but he
                    was in touch with them, and so was his embassy. They did some excellent
                    reporting during that period. First hand reporting, what was going on and how
                    people were thinking, etc. And then there came a break with...well, a little
                    counterrevolution developed, an admiral took it over. An admiral was in the
                    streets with his people, and the embassy, I must say, was in the streets with
                    him, and Carlucci was in the embassy. We were in close touch with him. So I
                    wrote a telegram with instructions to Carlucci saying, “Go see the Admiral, or
                    get in touch with the Admiral, and tell him various things, the meaning of which
                    was, he enjoys our sympathy and support. I was office director still, we went up
                    to see Kissinger who wanted to talk about that. And he said, “But does he know
                    that we are with him?” I had the great pleasure of saying, “Mr. Secretary, the
                    telegram is on your desk,” as indeed there was. And literally he went over, and
                    by George, there it was. So we embraced this new counterrevolution.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: We were indeed taking sides, very clearly. Fortunately they won.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just going to say, it's always a dangerous

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: It is, but we wanted there to be no doubt, and we also believed
                    obviously that awareness of American backing would be a factor and support.
                    Anyhow, they won. Came the change and Mario Suarez became Prime Minister. I had
                    been to see him several times in Lisbon with Carlucci, who had very close
                    relations with him. Carlucci spoke Portuguese, Suarez, I think, spoke nothing
                    but Portuguese. They had established a very close relationship before Suarez
                    came back into power. So when he did become Prime Minister, we were very well
                    installed. Suarez came to Washington as Prime Minister and I remember there was
                    a dinner at the Portuguese embassy. He arrived, his wife had a full length mink
                    coat. I said to my wife, “I think we're going to like Socialists like this.”
                    These are the right kinds of socialists. He turned out to be not only a good
                    Prime Minister, but very friendly towards the United States. Carlucci had said
                    consistently he would be, and Kissinger doubted it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Bureau of European Affairs, in your role in this,
                        were you playing sort of a buffer between Carlucci and Kissinger. What was
                        the attitude?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: No, I don't think it ever came to that. Kissinger respected Carlucci,
                    and he sometimes felt like hitting him over the head with a baseball bat, but he
                    did respect him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Carlucci came in a way with his own Washington power base,
                        didn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Well, he was Weinberger's deputy. But I think it was just the integrity
                    he demonstrated as ambassador, and his constant energy, and the fact that he had
                    had the courage to say things to Washington that Washington really didn't want
                    to hear. Washington was much more prepared to be told how desperate these people
                    were, and how awful things were going to be. But Carlucci, to his great credit
                    as a person, and as a diplomat, maintained a very steady course, as I said from
                    the beginning, ride with it, it'll probably work out, it isn't going to be as
                    bad as they say they're going to be. And in the end of it, he was fully
                    vindicated.</p>

                        you fend off these separatists?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: With the change in the political climate on the mainland, the separatist
                    movement lost its steam, and lost its whole reason for being. I might tell one
                    little story about Portugal before we move on. Before the actual
                    counterrevolution took to the streets in Lisbon, there crumbling around the
                    edges. The poor Portuguese ambassador there was having a terrible time because
                    he was trying to be loyal to his country, to a government to which he had no
                    sympathy whatsoever. He got very few communications. Sometimes he wasn't paid,
                    and he wasn't able to pay his staff. The revolutionaries were simply waiting
                    until they had full power to make all the changes. So he was here at the end of
                    a very long, very dry pipeline in terms of both information and money. So he
                    relied on us in the Department to sort of tell him what was going on. One day
                    there was a ticker item about a farmers demonstration in a little town in the
                    northern part of Portugal, in which they had burned down the local communist
                    party headquarters building. So I called the Ambassador, and gave him a little
                    summary, and I said in such-and-such village the farmers have burned down the
                    building that is used for the communist party headquarters. And there was a
                    little pause, and he said, “Oh, oh, oh, that building belongs to my
                    father-in-law.” And then he said, “But he won't mind.” He was a splendid
                    man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about with the Spanish and the base negotiations.
                        Franco was still in power at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: Yes, Franco was still in power. The Spaniards wanted a closer military
                    relationship than we were prepared to give them. And they demonstrated this
                    desire in various requests for consultations, for planning, for this or for
                    that, and there was a difference between the Pentagon and State over these
                    issues. Not a very big difference. But the Pentagon was more disposed to be
                    conciliatory as much as possible, and State, being aware of Congressional
                    attitudes toward Franco, was the defender of her(?). We had made a mistake, I
                    think, in letting the American Air Force commander in Spain, the senior
                    negotiator, so there were periodic inter-agency problems that had to be
                    reconciled. But they were not major, they were moving along slowly, and they
                    came to a conclusion that fall in New York when the Spanish Foreign Minister
                    came, met with Kissinger in New York for the final conclusion of the
                    negotiations. At issue were a lot of a) whether it would be a treaty, or an
                    executive agreement. The Spaniards wanted a treaty, we thought a treaty would
                    never get through the Senate. We wanted an executive agreement, and a couple of
                    other things. These final meetings in New York, with Wells Stabler as the
                    ambassador, was also present. And the Foreign Minister, who had been ambassador
                    in Paris, and looked like a 16th century Goliath painting, I've forgotten his
                    name. His staff lived in terror of him. They negotiated the final issues just
                    sitting across from each other. One was the amount of aid they wanted, a grant
                    aid, we had offered them 10 and they wanted 20 or something. I remember
                    Kissinger saying, “Well, if we're giving them 10 I suppose we can make it 15,”
                    and that was done. Then they got on to the subject of there's $15 million per
                    year grant, plus all the other things. Then they got on the subject of a treaty
                    which the Spaniards wanted more because obviously it's more senior standing.
                    Kissinger made the point that, “If I propose a treaty to the Senate, the streets
                    will be full of people.” The Foreign Minister looked him straight in the eye and
                    said, “As ambassador in Paris, I've had the streets really full of angry people,
                    they don't bother me.” So they worked out that issue and it was finally an
                    executive agreement. There were a couple of small points and the Spanish Foreign
                    Minister was unrelenting. He was like a little terrier that had Kissinger's leg
                    and would not let go. Finally at one point Kissinger said, “You're a high
                    roller.” And we had to explain what a high roller was. Anyhow, they reached
                    agreement, the executive agreement was signed in the Spanish embassy on a
                    Saturday afternoon. And that Senate negotiations were taken care of. But Franco
                    was alive, he was doddering. The year before his Foreign Minister, Blanco, had
                    been blown up by a bomb. We sent the Vice President to the delegation, Porter
                    went with him, I didn't go because I went out to the airport to meet my Mother
                    and missed the plane. But anyhow, Porter came back saying, “He's ga-ga,”
                    referring to Franco. They had an audience with him and he said Franco just sat
                    in his chair, and he drooled, and didn't say anything at all. I gather in fact
                    Franco had periods, some periods he was quite lucid, other periods he was like
                    that. But Franco was obviously past his prime.And then in the fall of 1976, I
                    remember there was just a routine ticker saying the Spanish cabinet meeting had
                    been canceled because Franco was indisposed. So I took it back to the Spanish
                    desk officer, Matt Durkey, and said, “Keep your eye on this situation.” And
                    little did we know that in fact that was the final crisis. He lingered, and was
                    made to linger I think quite indecorously, for days and days. They kept him
                    alive. They were so frightened of what would happen, and what might happen, when
                    he died that they prolonged his life by every possible means. It was
                    unfortunate. There was operation after operation. Finally he died, and there was
                    indeed great rejoicing in Spain. I had the impression then, and I think it's
                    still correct even after living later in Spain, the rejoicing was not only
                    relief, but it was an end to boredom because in fact a lot had been done during
                    the last years of Franco's regime in ways except the psychological. It was still
                    the old regime, it was still the stultifying psychological, and especially
                    cultural atmosphere. Things were going smoothly, the country was prospering. The
                    margins had been, of what was permissible, had been widened consistently over
                    the years, but people were bored, and they knew that with the end of the Franco
                    period, life would change and become more interesting. And to a large degree I
                    think that was in fact the case. The reaction in the country was virtually zero.
                    There was no reaction. In the succeeding years the Francos were gradually edged
                    out of power, voted out.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we thinking? Obviously having just gone through
                        the trauma of the Portuguese thing, we must have been looking everywhere to
                        see who were the wild men who might take over, weren't we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Oh, yes. But there was an element there that we pinned some hopes on,
                    but they were very uncertain hopes, and that was the King. The King had been
                    brought up as creature of Franco. He had been trained in a military academy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: King Juan Carlos.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: King Juan Carlos, yes. He'd been brought up in a Francoist mold. Franco
                    had made him his heir and successor, and apparently really had great affection
                    for him, and probably even was reciprocated. But there was always a question as
                    to what the real role of the King would be, and nobody knew. There were
                    indications, and there were signals that the succession would be a respectable
                    one. And as I said, the last years of the Franco period, things that would have
                    brought about a jail sentencing, were tolerated, were permitted. Fewer people
                    were going to jail for political crimes, and once in jail they were not being
                    badly treated.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>To leap ahead, when I was in Spain the then Minister of Justice, a socialist, led
                    a parliamentary commission to visit some prisoners. To one of them he said, “Ah,
                    this is where I was for...” whatever the period was, and he said, “it really
                    wasn't so bad.” But nonetheless, the changes away from the previously brutal
                    years had created an atmosphere that was essentially nonviolent, it was
                    tolerant. The socialists had lived in France in exile for most of the time, they
                    were back in Spain. The parties were dormant, you might say, but they were
                    working, they were building. Felipe Gonzalez had returned to Spain, this young
                    pro-France(?) some years before. Wells Stapler had invited him to the embassy.
                    So things had already begun to move. There was not the fear, there was
                    uncertainty, but there was not the fear of what might happen in Spain, as there
                    had been in the case of Portugal. There was a transition, a Francoist
                    transition, the Prime Minister whose name I've forgotten, who, although a
                    Francoist, took some steps in a less illiberal direction, but he didn't last
                    very long. He was replaced by Suarez, [Adolfo?} his first name but starts with
                    an A, I know, because we had a message saying, there will be a new Prime
                    Minister, and his initials are A.S., so we quickly got out the list...a serving
                    minister. Well, there were two, and one was Suarez, and the other was somebody
                    else. Suarez, who had been a Francoist, a Minister of Youth and Sports in the
                    Franco regime. The King made this choice, he was the new Prime Minister. Young,
                    rather attractive, close to the King, and he began, you might say, either an
                    active or a passive dismantling of the Franco regime and structure. And it was
                    done from within. It was done by those concerned. The extremists were gradually
                    edged out and the less extreme for a while were kept in. It was an amazing
                    transition. There was fear of the bunker, which was the Francoist
                    political-military-industrial-financial establishment. Lots of cartoons at that
                    time showed the fortress, the bunker. And it was believed that when elections
                    were held, as they were scheduled to be held very soon, the bunker would show
                    that it controlled enormous force, influence and resources. All the forces and
                    influences that were imputed to it. Everyone assumed the elections were held,
                    and the bunker, the Francoist parties received a very small percentage of votes,
                    maybe as much as 15%, I'm not...that may have been it. The communists, who of
                    course were the other party, received also a very small percentage of the votes.
                    So the transition regime continued in power, gradually changing, riding an
                    economy that was doing well which of course helped, and settling in for a long
                    haul. And maybe there we ought to stop because I better get my car before they
                    get it.</p>

                        time we get together, before we leave EUR, a bit about how you saw the
                        transition between the Ford administration, and Kissinger, and the
                        Carter-Vance administration regarding western Europe, and we'll pick it up
                        from there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Today is April 10th, 1995. Bob, you heard that last statement where we'll pick it
                    up. You were what, the DAS for Western Southern Europe. You were there during
                    the transition period.</p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Transition from the Nixon-Kissinger period to the Carter-Vance
                    period.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In some places that can be rather stressful for the
                        professionals around because you have new boys on the block, and they want
                        to stretch their muscles, and do something different and make their mark,
                        and always there's a sort of learning curve problem. Did you find that in
                        your particular area, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: It was not as dramatic, not as sensible, as I had expected it to be.
                    There was a change, of course, in the Assistant Secretaries, a very gradual one.
                    Arthur Hartman left and went to Paris. George Vest came in from being director
                    of political-military affairs. So it was a change of names and faces, but not of
                    substance, or really of style. Both were extremely impressive individuals, both
                    of them. Over time however, I'm talking after three or four months...I should
                    add, to go back a bit, dealings with the NSC were also easier than I had
                    expected them to be. They were well-meaning, well intentioned, certainly
                    competent people, so the transition in the early days was quite smooth. What we
                    found out later on was, first of all at the NSC level, the people we dealt with,
                    despite having the personal and the professional qualifications that I
                    mentioned, showed themselves at times to be extremely, well, naive. It was
                    reinventing the wheel sort of idea, and what were proposed to us as really
                    innovations and ideas, frequently were things that we had long since tried, and
                    had not worked. So, we were frequently in a position of deflecting what seemed
                    to be new ideas from going very far because they were not new, and we knew they
                    would not go very far. It was not an unpleasant situation, it was just somewhat
                    frustrating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Often this requires more diplomacy than dealing with
                        foreign countries.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Personal relations were always good, they were always accessible on the
                    telephone and we met with some regularity. But we were, as I said, frequently in
                    that situation of turning aside brilliant innovations on the grounds they were
                    not innovations, and that we too had thought them brilliant some months or years
                    earlier.</p>
                <p>The more difficult, more profound, differences were at the top. With Nixon and
                    Kissinger, of course, you had the ultimate pragmatists, very perceptive, very
                    sensitive to the American interests in any particular situation. And well
                    versed, very comfortable in the concept of the use of force to achieve a
                    particular purpose. I don't mean military force, I just mean the power of the
                    United States in its general terms as an element in the accomplishment of
                    foreign policy objectives. We went from that, in which areas were well defined,
                    interests were primary, etc., to a situation in which interests were present but
                    less vigorously pursued because of other complicating factors. And, of course, I
                    realize a lot of people today would say, oh, yes, Chile and all that sort of
                    thing, but we found that it was difficult to get clear cut decisions, and when
                    we got them we would have a decision one day, and then maybe before long it
                    would be changed, not in the White House at the staff level, but frequently by
                    the President himself. The great example of that was the so-called neutron
                    bomb.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that was a major one, and you were dealing with that,
                        weren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Yes, I remember it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you explain what the so-called neutron, the whole
                        issue because I think it's very important.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Well, of course, I do not recall the technical aspects. It was designed
                    to be effective against armor, as I recall, by the penetrating power of these
                    lethal neutrons. It was a new type of weapon whose explosive powers were
                    dispersed in killing power, rather than destructive power. Right or wrong, the
                    administration decided that we would pursue that new weapon because of its vast
                    military potential. So it made a great, great effort to do so with the NATO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved with all of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Not directly because it was done mostly in NATO. Of course anything we
                    did in a bilateral area, yes, with my countries I was involved in. We were
                    unrelenting and unyielding in our pursuit of it, and, of course, at the same
                    time the Russians, for exactly the same reasons, were putting out their best
                    efforts to defeat it, demonstrations and everything they controlled in western
                    Europe was out in the streets, or in the newspaper columns, developing all of
                    the thousand of arguments why it was not a good thing to do. And you remember
                    one of them was, it saves buildings but kills people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, its a capitalistic weapon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might point out to put it in perspective. This weapon
                        was particularly designed against large tank forces, armor, and the Soviet
                        Union had a tremendous preponderance of armor. So from our point of view
                        this made a hell of a lot of sense. I mean, if you're going to kill people,
                        it's better to go after them rather than just trying to make rubble.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: NATO strategy assumed that any Soviet movement on land would involve
                    massed armor formations and this is what it was designed against. Anyhow, we
                    finally prevailed, even got the Germans—I guess it was Helmut Schmidt at that
                    time—to agree, and we were going for the final endorsement in NATO. Then
                    suddenly one Saturday morning George Vest got a telephone call from the White
                    House saying the President had changed his mind, and therefore we would not
                    pursue it. I remember sitting around in his office at that very moment talking
                    about, not only our frustrations, but what kind of message were we sending to
                    the Soviets. And that is, I guess, the most easily remembered example. It was
                    certainly one of the most dramatic. It was not the only one because in general
                    it was hard to get clear cut focused decisions in the way that we had been
                    accustomed to getting them under the preceding administration. So, yes, there
                    were elements in the transition that we had to wrestle with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can we talk a little more about the neutron bomb. What
                        were the reactions you were getting. Your bailiwick were which countries
                        now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Western Europe. France, Italy, Spain, Portugal were the main ones, East
                    Turkey and Cyprus, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The most publicized one is the fact that Helmut Schmidt
                        had sort of laid himself way out on a limb, being from the socialist side,
                        and going for this thing and Carter had cut him off, and he despised Carter
                        thereafter. But in your countries, were you getting any reflection of this.
                        I mean we had obviously been using pressure to get people to accept this,
                        and then to have this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: The French had never been enthusiastic. The biggest problems were the
                    British and the Germans, both of whom felt betrayed, as you said. And it did
                    have an effect on our future position in dealing with those governments in that
                    administration because whatever the personal relations might have been, there
                    was always an element of doubt, which is understandable as to just how
                    persevering we would be once we made a decision, once we took a difficult
                    position. How far will the Americans go with it if things really get tough. Then
                    there was always that element of doubt in their minds. But that was apart from
                    dealing with the transition administration to administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude of the Italians on this? Because
                        they'd usually been kind of with us on some of the more difficult positions,
                        even though they might not agree.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: The effect was devastating, even if the governments individually might
                    have been relieved that suddenly the pressure was off in their own streets and
                    things, they're in the same quandary. The position of the United States in NATO
                    was enormously diminished by this single decision. It was not something that
                    went away quickly and easily.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You sat there with George Vest talking about this, at the
                        time when you heard this decision was that a subject of discussion about not
                        just the use or non-use of the neutron weapon, but about its affect on our
                        alliance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Oh, indeed. George, of course, had been deeply involved in things
                    regarding NATO, and the European communities for a long time, so he sensed it
                    first and foremost. My particular interest was with the countries I was
                    concerned with. I knew it would be secondary because I was not concerned with
                    the British or the Germans. The French position sort of took it in stride, well,
                    that's what one would expect. Giscard d'Estaing, I think, was the President and
                    our relations were not all that brotherly. I forget who the Foreign Minister was
                    at that particular time, but they sort of said, first of all, “Yes, we might
                    have expected it,” and then secondly, within Europe they said, “Well, you know,
                    this is what you have to expect.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've been saying it all the time. I'm pushing this a
                        little more because this was a very important decision. It's made at the
                        top. Do you know, did George Vest, he was the Assistant Secretary for
                        European Affairs, knowing what the effect would be, did he go to Vance? Was
                        that within your purview and say, “Look, let's reconsider this thing because
                        this is...” I mean going to Vance to go to the President, it's not just the
                        neutron bomb, it's all sorts of things that are going to come out of this.
                        Or did we feel comfortable? Maybe nobody felt comfortable trying to do
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I don't recall a specific reaction on George's part other than general
                    dismay because he saw the implications both on the western side and the eastern
                    side. I think he was very disappointed in the role of the Secretary. But I don't
                    want to put words in his mouth, I'm sure you're talking to George, and you
                    should talk to him. But he was very unhappy for all the right reasons. My
                    recollection is quite vague but I think he concluded that it would be pointless
                    to go back to the Secretary because he assumed the Secretary was part of the
                    President's decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one did have the feeling that this was a group that
                        didn't understand the Soviet Union at that point. I mean, they thought they
                        could treat it as a reasonable country.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: You have to go back to something I alluded to earlier. I think there was
                    a feeling that they didn't understand the role of the United States in the
                    world, our obligations, our position, our responsibility, our possibilities, all
                    of those things. I don't want to be too unkind to them because certainly they
                    were well qualified, and well intentioned, but there was this problem of, well,
                    it was part of the brilliant new idea scheme of things that just exactly what
                    was the position of the United States in the world when it came to pursuing our
                    own national interests. Of course, at that time another general obstacle, as we
                    saw it, suddenly was in the area of human rights. The situation of human rights
                    within a particular country many times took on more importance than the
                    interests of the United States in that country. Again, people say, ah, yes,
                    Chile and the American coziness with dictators, etc., was a fact. It really was
                    a fact, nobody had any illusions about a particular country, or what we should
                    be striving toward, etc., it was just that there were times and that's when the
                    Bureau of Human Relations was created.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bureau of Human Rights, with Pat Derian as Assistant

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: ...came into existence, and suddenly seemed to have an overriding veto
                    on everything. Human rights have become an accepted foreign policy objective,
                    thanks to the Carter administration, because he did impose that, and it is
                    accepted throughout the world. That human rights situation in a country is a
                    valid interest of other countries. But again, there was this confusion between
                    the interests of the United States, and the interests of others, and which
                    should we be pursuing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: They did in the southern European area of Greece, Turkey, Cyprus. I
                    recall the Cyprus crisis of the summer of 1974.</p>

                <p>BARBOUR: The Turks invaded with what they thought, and history may agree with
                    them, was a valid cause. It's an interesting example. I was not in the bureau at
                    that time, I was still in Personnel, but I was called up to work on the Task
                    Force the next day. It's an interesting example of a diplomatic failure on our
                    part because it was the era of the Greek colonels in Athens. We didn't really
                    like them, but we lived with them, and there was a feeling, I guess on the part
                    of the Secretary, that you don't have to like people in order to get along with
                    them because our bases were important, Greece was in NATO, and that important,
                    the southeastern flank was significant, and all that sort of thing. Anyhow, we
                    knew that the Greek colonels had interests in Cyprus. They still had the
                    insurrection area infrastructure and all that sort of stuff. We sent them a
                    message, do not do anything. But the message was, you might say garbled in
                    transmission. The ambassador chose to have it delivered at a lower level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was Henry Tasca.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Yes...had it delivered at a lower level through non-official channels,
                    and it was received by the Greek military as a fig leaf, the Americans are just
                    stating this for the position. What it really means is they will understand if
                    we go ahead, and go ahead they did. Anyhow, the result was that the island was
                    partitioned, as it still is, mass movements of populations back and forth. It
                    was still just a situation. Well, I think the spring of 1978, the Turks had been
                    suffering for some time under a virtual arms embargo on our part. The Greek
                    lobby was very active, very vociferous, and very successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the times it was considered as successful, almost even
                        more so than the Israel lobby.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: It was much less subtle, and used a sledge hammer when necessary to
                    considerable effect. The result was the Turks more or less made pariahs, had
                    become pariahs to the administration. And they were suffering because of it,
                    suffering economically, and suffering militarily because the military
                    establishment was deteriorating. I forget exactly what the chronology was, but
                    the military came back into power in Turkey. Suarez was forced to take over
                    power again because Turkey gave every sign of falling apart. The government had
                    ceased to function, there was turmoil in the streets. You had these extremist
                    parties in the parliament blocking all forms of helpful legislation. The country
                    was in very serious straits. And it was partly because of their situation
                    vis-a-vis NATO, and vis-a-vis us. In any case, the Carter administration decided
                    to take a serious look at the situation, and then consider changing its
                    policies. So it brought in Clark Clifford as a special emissary for that
                    purpose. He conducted his own review of it, and concluded that the policy on
                    Turkey should be changed, and that we should cancel the embargo. He got his
                    views accepted in the White House by the President. We went to Congress with new
                    legislation, and there the administration did persevere against great
                    opposition, against a lot of noise from the Greeks, a lot of hostility even from
                    some people in Congress. They did persevere, and they did succeed, and that was,
                    I think, a landmark legislation. And a good instance where they did recognize
                    where American interests lay, and pursued them, and did so successfully, but not
                    easily. It was a hard fight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the role when Clark Clifford was looking at this
                        and even before he started looking at this. In the first place you have a
                        Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance, who had gone out there a couple of times.
                        He had gotten his hands and feet dirty in the Cyprus situation before, so
                        unlike Kissinger who really didn't understand it, I mean he didn't treat it
                        as sort of a side show until it got too big for him. Vance knew it. You are
                        the country director dealing with this area, what was your role before
                        Clifford went. What were we saying? That we better watch Turkey because
                        we've got real interests there, how did this translate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: Well, most of this had developed before I had anything to do with it. We
                    had a somewhat ambivalent policy towards Turkey, on a strictly bilateral level
                    day-to-day relations. There was a good deal of understanding and sympathy. At
                    the policy level the policy limitations were very much in effect. So the Turks
                    tried very hard through sending people here to cause us to understand their
                    situation. Individual attitudes were rather sympathetic, and how these
                    translated up to the Secretary, I don't know. But the Counselor of the
                    Department, Matt Nimetz, was one of Cyrus Vance's law partners. When he came in
                    he gave him that particular brief, and Nimetz worked the brief. And he worked it
                    with George Vest, and with the Office of Southern European Affairs—Nelson Lansky
                    who was in charge. You've probably talked to Nelson, who has, I think, yet to
                    divest himself 100% of that particular problem. Nelson is extremely competent,
                    and energetic, and he had an extremely good staff with him, very fast, very
                    proficient, well versed, they could turn out a good paper in a couple of hours
                    which is quite a feat in the Department of State. So I decided it would be a
                    mistake to inject myself from outside too much into that process. Not a very
                    happy role, but I really thought, here you have a smooth running, well informed,
                    articulate, and well run, organized operation, don't interfere with it. So I
                    remained on the periphery. I met with Nimetz, I met with George, I met with
                    Clark Clifford, but I did not carry the ball. George really carried the ball
                    when it got into the final stages, including the legislative ball, and he did so
                    very effectively. He put together the Congressional operation in which we all
                    participated, but it was really Clifford dealing with the President on some of
                    these issues alone, and dealing with the Secretary. Obviously dealing with the
                    President when the Secretary is back. They reached these decisions that the
                    policy should be reversed 180 degrees, and they did so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about human rights in Turkey?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Human rights in Cyprus was a bigger problem because it was a scab that
                    the Greeks and the Greek Cypriots kept picking at all the time. And they
                    marched, and they marched out all the atrocities the Turks were committing, and
                    the threats they mounting against Greece, and all the provocations they were
                    engaged in, etc. I remember one day the ambassador of Cyprus came in, I don't
                    recall whether he'd seen George or Bessie Sohn, I think it was George. So he
                    came in and he unburdened himself of his brief of grievances, they were, as
                    frequently was the case, utterly outrageous. I walked him back to the elevator,
                    and said to him, “You don't really believe all that stuff, do you?” And he said,
                    “No, but I have to say it.” It was that kind of atmosphere.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were saying some of this, you were smiling, to get
                        this into the record. In diplomatic practice, somebody comes in with a whole
                        laundry list, particularly horror stories, when you realize you're between
                        two rivals and you can get the same from the other side, it tends to scout
                        out everything. In fact, although it maybe sounds like they're making strong
                        protests on paper, in many ways at least at the professional level, they're
                        undercutting their position because you begin to not treat anything they say
                        seriously. I'm speaking as somebody who served four years in Athens.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Ah, there you are, you know much more about it than I do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I left July 1st, 1974, but the point being that once you
                        get into that action, would you say that this happens...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: You hear them out. Does it become a factor in the policy analysis and
                    evaluation? In that case it did not, because the Clifford operation led to
                    policy level conclusions that had always been present at the working level
                    within the bureau. We always felt, not that the Turks were getting a raw deal,
                    but that we were doing ourselves a great disservice vis-a-vis their strategic
                    situation, vis-a-vis their situation in NATO, and vis-a-vis the Alliance itself.
                    We were doing ourselves a great disservice by keeping them at arm's length on
                    everything that mattered. So we were quite pleased that Clifford reached the
                    same conclusion himself. Nimetz did not. Nimetz was always very critical on the
                    subject of the Greeks and the Turks until Clifford came into the picture. And,
                    of course, as the results of our new policy initiative became clear, the Greeks
                    became even more strident, as I said, and so did the people who had similar
                    views in Congress. That's the opposition I referred that had to be overcome in
                    getting the legislation through. But we would listen to them. The Cyprus
                    ambassador's refreshing attitude toward what he had to do to carry out his
                    instructions, was of course already in our own minds, because some of the things
                    they were complaining about were so outrageous. And then, of course, you had
                    situations where we were doing things in Cyprus in the humanitarian area,
                    economic area, and doing things. Also in Greece. We had a terrible time getting
                    the Greeks to acknowledge that we were in fact being of any assistance to them
                    whatsoever. They were not their best advocates and maybe your four years in
                    Athens causes you to understand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you left in '78 were there any other major issues
                        in your bailiwick? In Spain, Italy, France.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: Relations with France were always friendly but prickly. The French
                    always had a way of developing their own ideas as to what events in Europe
                    should be within the Alliance, and that sort of thing. It was a chronic
                    day-to-day problem. We had some difficulties really within multilateral
                    institutions. We could never count on support for doing things. Now there were
                    times when they would come through bravely, brilliantly, and I think proved that
                    when national interest coincided, they were the ultimate pragmatist. When their
                    interest coincided with ours they could be counted on 100%, when they didn't
                    then they made it clear that we were quite wrong.</p>
                <p>In Italy the political situation bubbled and bubbled. The problem there was seen,
                    I think, historically the wrong problem. The problem was, how to keep the
                    communists, not just out of power, but away from power. We did not talk to
                    anybody in the communist party at that time. The ambassadors were not only
                    enjoined from doing so, but had no interest whatsoever in doing so. So one of
                    the things we did do was to get...I remember specifically, getting a telegram, a
                    short one going out, saying, “If you think it would serve the interest of the
                    United States government to have contacts with the communist party, you are
                    authorized to do so, and you are the judge of whether it would be.” So there was
                    that that moved along.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, this was somewhat earlier, but we had the vestiges of the Portuguese
                    revolution. This was 1975, by that time I was Director of Western Europe, we may
                    have talked about it. We still had the vestiges of that. The Portuguese, after a
                    period of internal turmoil but virtually no blood, pulled themselves together,
                    brought in Mario Suarez, and the government first was left center, and then
                    moved back to the center.</p>
                <p>Spain, we had the transition. Franco died in 1976, I think, when I was in Western
                    European Affairs. By 1978 the effects of the transition were becoming clearer.
                    It was by no means given that it would succeed, but it had moved along. It was
                    not the crisis that it had been at one time, but it was still a very interesting
                    and important situation. The revolution from within, by means of which of using
                    ex former Franco people, they threw out their old system, and brought in a new
                    one. It was fascinating to watch.</p>
                <p>In Malta we had Dom Mintoff. That was one of the countries that we had to work
                    with. Dom Mintoff was a fantastic political phenomenon, utterly, utterly I think
                    without scruples, very effective, and a real tyrant in many ways. Not at all
                    above bending the laws, using a little elbow and muscle here and there if people
                    were causing trouble. We had no serious problems with him because Malta didn't
                    count all that much, but it was potentially troublesome.</p>

                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: The Libyans, in fact, were there. They had established a bilateral
                    relationship that we didn't like at all. They had bought into a shipyard, as I
                    recall. They had denied us port access, a port that we had used for years. The
                    British had left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say the Maltese would not let us have port
                        access.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: The Navy had used Malta for decades, then under Mintoff that right had
                    been withdrawn. The British had been pretty much expelled. The British Navy
                    could go in, but not in the way that it could before, and I think could not use
                    the dockyards. They had, as I recall, a large dry dock, a very large dry dock,
                    it was suddenly no longer available to them or to us. The Libyans had signed
                    some commercial contracts which I think gave them access to facilities in Libya
                    for helicopter repair, and various other things that we didn't like at all. It
                    was not a serious problem. Soviet commercial ships could go in, fishing vessels
                    could go in, trawlers with all their antenna could go in. Mintoff, of course,
                    was fully aware but he was obviously getting advantages from it, and I think he
                    undoubtedly enjoyed being nasty to the rest of us. It was not a serious problem,
                    but we never knew when it might become more serious than in fact it was. Largely
                    it was Mintoff's personality, and he was a very interesting individual.</p>
                <p>Those were the sort of things that we thought about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Our ambassador in Italy was Richard Gardner, and the
                        communist party was always hovering around 30%. What was his proclivity
                        vis-a-vis the communists as far as wanting to make contact with them that
                        was left to his judgment. Did he make any movement towards doing that, or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: To my surprise, he did not pick up happily the authority that we thought
                    we had gone a long way to give to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting because he was an academic coming out of
                        Columbia University, and one would have thought that if for no other reason
                        than just wanting to show some movement or something, because the communists
                        at that time were much more what we would call Euro-communists than tools of
                        the Soviet Union. At least that's the way we were seeing it at the
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: Well they called themselves Euro-communists. It was ironic because at
                    the working level we had felt for years, even before the time I was there, that
                    we were being suckered by all the parties of the establishment who, of course,
                    were not only in touch with the communists, but though we did not know it, in
                    bed with them. The communists were just as much of that establishment as anybody
                    else. They played by the same rules and got the same benefits, proportional, of
                    course. And we had always thought this is crazy, everybody is talking to them
                    but us. But they, of course, being the Christian Democrats, would say, oh, no,
                    no, if you start talking to the communists imagine what that will do to their
                    position in Italy. The answer to that was that view was accepted, but they never
                    got a lot of sympathy for it. That's one of the things the new administration
                    did do. Was it turned to our advantage? No, it was not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Washington and went to Madrid where you served
                        from '78 to '84, and you went as Deputy Chief of Mission. Can you tell me
                        how you got the job, and who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I'd been in Washington about five years at that time. No embassies were
                    opening up, none were expected to open up for about six months, and I thought I
                    would like to go out. And moreover college tuitions were coming along, staring
                    us in the face, and it was easier to save money abroad than it was in
                    Washington. That was a significant factor. Arthur asked me to go to Paris with
                    him, and I was quite keen to do that, we'd been in Paris before and it was a
                    good job. But in order for that to happen, he wanted his DCM to get his own
                    embassy, Sam Gammon, and I agreed completely that that indeed should be a
                    precondition. So we waited, and nothing was happening for Sam, and nothing was
                    happening anyplace else for the same reasons that I wasn't going to one. The
                    Department passed a rule, a new policy, told me to my surprise it was strictly a
                    Personnel thing, saying that three year assignment limits were to be imposed,
                    and that meant that Sam Eaton in Madrid would have to be leaving. He had been
                    there three years, more than three years. So Madrid was opening up, Paris was
                    not. I had majored in Spanish literature in college, had always wanted to go to
                    Spain. I had always been fascinated by that country, and there was an
                    opportunity. Wells Stapler was the ambassador, I had known Wells a long time
                    since we had been in Paris together. Had been together in Paris, in Rome and in
                    the Department. So he said, “Sure, okay, if you want to come here, if you think
                    you could learn to speak Spanish.” And that's really how it eventuated. I went
                    to Madrid very happily, excitedly. In the meantime, of course, Wells left at his
                    own volition. Wells wanted to leave and did. He did not want another embassy
                    which he could have had.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>And Terry Todman went. I did not know Terry Todman. I had never even met him so
                    far as I know. So I said, well so much for that. I'll just wait for Paris to
                    open. So I went to see him as Assistant Secretary, and said to him in so many
                    words, “Look, I know that you've been in this business a long time, you have
                    lots of people you're comfortable with you want for your DCM, so in effect count
                    me out. I'm happy where I am and I'll just wait until Paris opens up, and go to
                    EUR. He asked whether I'd be willing to go if I was offered, “Oh sure, but I
                    fully realize that you want your own person.” We had a nice chat, and he took
                    the occasion to ask about Spain. And I went back to work, settled back in EUR,
                    and then four weeks later he called and said, “Why don't we leave things the way
                    they were.” And I went off with him and had the kind of experience in which I
                    said to myself over and over and over again, “If I'm ever an ambassador, I hope
                    I treat my DCM the way he treats his.” We had a warm personal professional
                    relationship, intimate. Our families, our wives, our children, a kind of a
                    relationship that in my inspector years I look for even now. The DCMs and
                    ambassadors to go in at any time, put your feet up, exchange funny stories, and
                    exchange gossip, talk about this, and talk about that, without being asked to
                    write something he just said off the top of his head, oh I just saw so and so,
                    he would not think it worthwhile to dictate and make a note to use later on. It
                    was a very happy relationship. That's why I stayed six years, as did he
                    almost.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because Todman was a major figure in the Foreign Service,
                        a very professional ambassador. How did he work within Spain? What was his
                        method of operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: It's remarkable, as a black American he was not enthusiastically
                    received by Spanish media, etc., before he went. There was still a lot of very
                    right wing sentiment in Spain, and Spain is one of the most homogeneous
                    countries in Europe, linguistically, culturally, ethnically, despite the various
                    dialects without a doubt it is a Catholic Hispanic society, almost like Japan in
                    its homogeneity. So there was that thing. He had never served in Europe. He had
                    spent his career in Africa, and South Asia, and Latin America, etc. So he went
                    there as a kind of outsider to Europe, but he also went there with enormous
                    professional and personal gifts. He spoke Spanish, very good Spanish very
                    easily, naturally. Great personal charm, extremely articulate, and very
                    sociable. So over a period of time, it was not very long, he had established
                    himself. And, of course, he went for the political jugular, he knew where it was
                    and knew where to go after it, and how to go after it, and he did so. He knew
                    everybody in the establishment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was the political jugular?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: It was in the political aorta, was the new system. It was still
                    struggling, it was still in the shadow of what they called the bunker, the
                    political-military establishment. They took the oath, they dealt with the old
                    Francoists, the military industrialists, the bankers, the big businessmen, and a
                    very noisy political party, noisy and nasty at times. But their assets, and
                    their viability, and the mass rallies they continued to organize with the blue
                    shirts and the upraised arms, and that sort of thing, still frightened a lot of
                    people and caused them to believe that this group had a lot more power than in
                    fact the first election showed that it did.</p>
                <p>Todman concluded that they were finished, and not worth wasting time on. He also
                    concluded, and this was almost less easy, that the old society should not be
                    alienated, but also not worth spending any time or money on. That the area in
                    which to work, to devote his efforts, was in this new developing sector, which
                    was the democratic sector. Of course, our objective was to promote democracy in
                    Spain farther down the road and bringing them into NATO. Our purposes in Spain
                    were very clear, and he staked them out and we all went after them, and
                    ultimately achieved them. We didn't do it, but we helped them along.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Spanish, as always, in any country they do it for
                        their own reasons, but the point is you try to ease the way, to provide
                        rationale.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Everything we did operationally was aimed to furthering that first
                    objective, helping democracy establish itself in Spain by bolstering certain
                    institutions, certain individuals that we came across starting with the King.
                    And working for a more democratic military establishment, and then NATO down the
                    road. And so we did, by operations, we had lots of visitors, we brought in
                    military visitors from NATO, Todman always organized a little intimate
                    gathering, they would speak, and this went on month after month. He was out
                    seeing them, talking to them. He was untiring, bursting with energy. And I don't
                    want to underestimate him, with a lot of charm and linguistic facility. He was
                    perfectly comfortable talking with the King, as well as was Wells for that
                    matter. But by the time we got there new people were coming on the scene.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>I remember one of the first things we did, one of the first luncheons he
                    organized after I got there which was about a week after he did, was a group of
                    labor leaders. The labor leaders had been beyond the pale for a long time, they
                    were among the untouchables. So he brought in these socialists, these wild
                    bearded people who didn't wear neckties. You know bearded people who don't wear
                    neckties are not to be trusted. So we had a luncheon for them, and I think it
                    was the first time that that particular group had ever been inside the
                    residence. And what did we do? Nothing, just had a nice lunch, chatted, showed
                    ourselves to be interested, friendly, potentially useful to them, etc. Well, the
                    Labor Attach� , John Glen, had been in touch with these people, and had been
                    working with them for a long time. They all knew him, they didn't know anybody
                    else. So this opened up a new front. Wells to his great credit was the first one
                    to bring in socialist leaders. That was a great breakthrough in itself. So the
                    process had started. What Todman did was to build on it, take advantage of every
                    new opening that came along. So when we got there we were not barnstormers, or
                    anything like that. We were just pushing on doors that were gradually that
                    either had been opened by Wells Stabler, or were opening themselves and we were
                    just pushing and helping, trying to show that the United States is not hostile.
                    Your own press will tell you the United States is really sympathetic to the
                    right, we are here to help you install democracy, and that's what we spent five
                    years that I was there, and he was there doing it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Knowing dynamics of places, I am sure that your
                        aristocracy, probably the old establishment, loves to have ambassadors,
                        diplomats, adorn their tables, and that's what they live on. But I would
                        think there would be quite a bit of resentment, and dog in the manger
                        business because they weren't getting the attention they used to get. Did
                        you find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Yes, but I didn't. I don't know whether it ever really manifested
                    itself, but as I think I said, Todman decided he didn't want to alienate them,
                    he just didn't want to waste any time on them. If someone invited him to
                    something, he would go if it was worthwhile, if it was not, they were a little
                    bit below on the horizon as far as the working staffs were concerned. We didn't
                    waste any time on them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the dynamics of “into NATO, not into NATO,”
                        while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: At that time they were in court(?), that was down the road. That was
                    someday, but certainly not something we wanted to wave at that time and frighten
                    them, which would have been the effect. It was down the road. It became much
                    more visible in the last couple of years that we were there, just as it became
                    visible to the Soviets objective. The Soviet ambassador had his objective to
                    keeping them out. He failed. But no, there were no dynamics at that time. We had
                    a very good military relationship with the Spanish, and a very good military to
                    military relationship. We had all kinds of joint institutions,
                    political-military affairs, etc. We didn't want to give the impression that we
                    were resistant to change in any of those areas of our relationships. It would
                    have been a great mistake to try to do so anyway because it was the kind of
                    change that could not be resisted. So our purpose was to show that in fact we
                    knew there were changes, the changes were for the better, we endorsed them, we
                    embraced them, and would facilitate them to the extent we could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any forces within the United States...in the

                        and they were the sort of people who were more comfortable with Franco. Did
                        you find any of this going on within the American political system that you
                        had to pay attention to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: No. The Spanish churches, at that time, were still also very
                    conservative, very conservative some elements of it. And you had a very
                    influential and prosperous Opus Dei organization to this day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is almost...you better describe what Opus Dei
                        is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Opus Dei at that time was an exclusively male organization made up of
                    people who along the lines of some of the old Orders of Chivalry. It took
                    certain vows to dedicate themselves to working for the church, vows of celibacy,
                    not poverty since most of them in Spain are very wealthy. Celibacy, dedication,
                    obedience, etc. Celibacy not in the old fashioned sense as many of them were
                    also married, but to dedicate themselves or working for the benefit of the
                    church. Genuinely ardent in their faith. They have an excellent university,
                    probably one of the very best in Spain in Navarra, and they work with young
                    people to bring them into the lay family of the church. They do so very
                    successfully. Anyhow, they were very present there, and a lot of people who
                    dealt with them in fact, bankers, leading businessmen, were and still are
                    members of Opus Dei, but not anti-democratic. Maybe they too sensed what was
                    coming and thought it would be unwise to oppose it. That was one of the
                    institutions present.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>The bunker more or less faded away. The first elections showed that they had very
                    little support, it was all noise, and there was a very quick reassessment in the
                    Spanish psyche about the extent of this threat, and it was promptly
                    redimensioned. There was an outburst you may recall in 1980 when they had this
                    wild gun-slinging lieutenant colonel, Tejero, who tried to overthrow the
                    government in a comic opera episode in which no one was hurt but he had the
                    entire government and parliament bottled up inside the Cortes for about 12
                    hours, and he was in command, but he didn't have the King. He thought he had the
                    captains generals with him, but he didn't because once the King put on his
                    uniform at 1:00 in the morning and addressed the nation and said to them, “Lay
                    down your arms, this is ridiculous. I command you.” They did. The captains
                    generals sat on their hands, and Colonel Tejero at dawn, I guess, was hungry for
                    breakfast and that was the end of it. He had his three or four people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When this happened it was on television, and he was up on
                        the dais making pronouncements.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: No, no. I was sitting at my desk listening to the radio, there's a new
                    government, it was a vote of confidence. Adolfo Suarez's government, a
                    confidence vote. And we were curious to see how it would come out, so I was
                    sitting there listening to it in my office, and as they called the names there
                    was shouting—I forget what the word was they were shouting. And then there was
                    shooting. They shot into the ceiling, repairs for which they later had to pay.
                    And in came this Lt. Colonel Tejero waving his pistol. By that time, when the
                    shooting took place, I reached into my drawer and pulled out my little pocket
                    dictating machine and set it by the radio. It was being televised but I don't
                    think it was live, but the cameras kept going. So, he came in and these Guardia
                    Nacional, who in the best traditions that the Guardia Nacional, thought they
                    were carrying out legitimate orders, trained their submachine guns on the
                    assembled audience, which was quite distinguished. And Tejero said, “Everybody
                    on the floor.” And down they went behind their desks, and before long he said,
                    “Shut off those cameras.” So they had to stop and shut down the radio. So in
                    keeping with Spanish hours that must have been 8:00 at night by then, 7:30 -
                    8:00. So we called the Operations Center, opened the line and kept it open for
                    the next 15 hours, and watched the scene evolve. Al Haig was Secretary of State.
                    At that position all we were trying to do was describe what was happening, and
                    figure out just exactly what it implied, and how far it was going to spread
                    because Spain is divided into military regions, and at that time each region had
                    a captain general in charge of the military establishment within that region.
                    And we did not know which ones, and indeed one or two were waffling. The one in
                    Valencia, in fact, did more than waffle, he did things for which he was later
                    punished. But in any case we monitored the situation which was, say if it was
                    7:00 in Madrid, was 1:00 in the morning in Washington. The President had gone to
                    bed, there really was not much the Washington establishment could do although at
                    that point in the early hours, we were, as I say, trying to see exactly what was
                    happening, what was going to happen. So we did not do what the Europeans were
                    able to do since it was also 7:00 or 8:00 in western Europe, and that is have
                    their chiefs of state get on the telephone. When we raised that possibility we
                    were told the President was asleep, and Al Haig said, “Well, it's an internal
                    affair at this point it's strictly a Spanish internal affair,” which enraged the
                    Spaniards. But having just been criticized for having said so much about other
                    situations in other countries that had proved to be inopportune, he was just not
                    saying anything.</p>
                <p>Early the next morning when the President was up, we got him on the telephone
                    with the King, but by that time it was all over, and the Spaniards saw we were
                    watching to see which way it was going to go. We weren't at all. We told the
                    Department about 11:00, I guess, the situation had been contained, and that was
                    before the King went on television. The ambassador had no instructions, of
                    course, and wasn't likely to get any at that hour from Washington so there
                    anything that he could do. In retrospect, of course, he should have acted on his
                    own. He would have taken a great risk, it would have paid off, but ambassadors
                    are taught to be disciplined.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's say this thing happened around 7:00-8:00, you said
                        by 11:00 you thought it had been contained. You're sitting there in the
                        embassy, how do you find out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Well, we had people out on the streets to see if anything else was
                    moving. We had the consular agents around, one of whom was in Valencia. Of
                    course, the Spanish media had gone wild and was full of radio and TV coverage in
                    situations throughout the country. They were determined, given their own
                    inclinations, to demonstrate that this thing wasn't going anywhere, at least
                    they hoped it wouldn't. The final determinant was of course the King. I was able
                    to talk to a friend who was the deputy commandant of the Guardia, but all he was
                    able to do was to confirm that they were real Guardia units. Our first reaction
                    was that these were the Basque terrorists who had gotten a hold of some Guardia
                    uniforms, and were staging this massive spectacular event in Madrid to get the
                    people out of jail that they wanted out of jail. That took up about the first
                    half hour until I was able to get the confirmation from Guardia Nacional itself.
                    So, what are the dimensions of this thing? Well, the dimensions at first were
                    horrendous, as I said. The entire government, because in that system you know,
                    they're all parliamentarians and we had a vote of confidence, every cabinet
                    minister is there, and every parliamentarian. It's a question of assessment, and
                    you were guided as you well know, by your own data base, as we say now, by the
                    people you can get on the telephone, what you get from your immediate coverage
                    and what is available. You feed it in with your conclusions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When things are really like that, you want quick stuff,
                        how about your military attach�s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Yes, they were out on the streets. We were very bold at that time
                    because this was 1980 more or less, we gave them all little radios. That was 14
                    years ago, portable radios, little walkie-talkies. We had them out on the
                    streets and I was scared to death, I said, “Keep these things in your pockets
                    unless you absolutely have to use them. Call in by telephone, use a pay phone.
                    Don't let them see Americans lurking in the background saying unintelligible
                    things on portable radios.” But we did have people on the streets, around the
                    parliament and out where they should have been. We got a lot of information
                    which confirmed our impressions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to get from our military people whether
                        there were troop movements. Because this is usually the key. If all of a
                        sudden the tanks or armored cars start rolling out of the barracks...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: ...as they did, about midnight we looked out of our windows and saw this
                    long line of armored cars proceeding down the boulevard. And the question was,
                    which way are their guns pointed? They were not factors. And what we learned
                    from one of the assistant army attach�s who was down there was that they drove
                    up with no orders, not clear what they were supposed to do, and turned around
                    and went back to their barracks. Another sign that this thing wasn't really
                    going to go anyplace, dramatic though it was.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>Some months later the Madrid newspaper, reconstructed the plot and the event in a
                    long series of articles. It was very good journalism but about three-quarters
                    reliable, which is very good, although it's better today, I think, than it was
                    then. Which showed that it really brought out the comic opera overtones of this
                    thing. There really were only about three plotters, that's the reason nobody
                    knew about it. And they had hoped to bring in some of the captains generals with
                    whom they were in touch, and some of whom like the one in Valencia, who were
                    sympathetic. But one of them showed up for a meeting of the conspirators, and
                    saw that he was in the wrong uniform, so he turned around and left. Another one,
                    they were to meet at a place by car, and the co-conspirator to be got lost.
                    There were a number of things like that, so it never went anywhere. Well, it
                    went to this dramatic culmination and Tejero is still in jail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view, before and after, King Juan Carlos, when
                        you first arrived there. What was the impression of Juan Carlos?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Well, let's go back to the time of Franco's death, which was in 1976,
                    maybe September. He was a very uncertain figure. He was, after all, Franco's
                    adopted son, and I don't know whether that's legal or not. Franco referred to
                    him as his son, treated him as a son, treated him as his heir to be, but never
                    institutionalized it. Sent him to all the military colleges, saw that he was
                    properly married, really was as much if not more of a father than the King's
                    real father, the Count of Barcelona. So when Franco died the question was, will
                    this pleasant, extremely agreeable, likeable, young man succeed? If so, to what
                    degree? And in accordance with what were believed to be Franco's intentions, the
                    successor government tried to make the King a figurehead. And Franco at one
                    point had said something like, “Yes, my heir will be tied hand and foot.” So the
                    new government acted as though the King was to be the figurehead. He was King,
                    he was never crowned, there was never a coronation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Took the oath before the Cortes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: He did, he took the Cortes, there was a high solemn mass, but there was
                    no coronation. He's never had a coronation. He was invested as King. So there
                    was a lot of doubt, but he had an adviser, another quasi-father figure, a
                    diplomat who died some years ago, much older than he was. And one surmises,
                    though I cannot document it, that he also had among his immediate team people
                    who have never spoken out, not even the adviser that I just referred to, whose
                    name I can't remember, ambassador somebody or other, never wrote any memoirs,
                    never talked about his role. So the extremely astute, and perceptive people who
                    had a very clear objective that institutionalizing the King in the role that
                    would lead Spain back to democracy. And either they coopted, or found an adult
                    post for him, who was the Minister of Youth Affairs. The political instrument
                    that would help him do the job. So the two came together, this is while I was
                    still in Washington, so it must have been 1977, I guess. And Henry Kissinger had
                    had ties to the King, and had his own interest and sympathetic, but unclear,
                    picture of the King's future role. Vernon Walters knew the King better than
                    anybody, and I think he succeeded in persuading him and people around Washington
                    that he should not be written off. His relationship goes back some time.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, after that less than clear start, we had reached a number of
                    quasi-conclusions. First of all, we did want Spain to return to democracy. As I
                    say, that was the number one objective of American policy, and very clear from
                    the very beginning. And then secondly, I guess our expectations rose as little
                    by little the King, and Adolfo Suarez after he became Prime Minister, began to
                    dismantle a lot of the old team, and put in new people, and that's how the
                    process began. Sam Eaton, who was DCM before me, has written a book about the
                    first couple of years of the transition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Having this background, when this attempted coup took
                        place, were you all asking at the embassy, where's the King, what's the King
                        going to do? Or was there any doubt of the role of the King?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: That was the key question, what will the King do? None of us believed
                    that the King would go over to these gun-slingers. But whether he would be
                    equivocal, whether he would think that his position might be more secure with
                    them, that was the question. We would have bet that he would come out against
                    them, but until he made his own move, and even to this day how much soul
                    searching within the palace there may have been, is not known because nobody has
                    come out. But, again, this same group of intimate counselors must have rallied
                    around him and bucked him up, and said, “This is the way to go,” which I'm sure
                    was in keeping with his own inclinations. But when it was announced that he
                    would appear on television, and he appeared in his uniform, there was no
                    question, and he said, “As your King, I command you.” And that was it. We knew
                    that he did command the armed forces, their loyalty was to the King, and they
                    were very, very proud of him.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: The King and Suarez developed a quite cordial relationship. They met
                    regularly. They worked well together and I guess they saw eye to eye, or if they
                    didn't, the King was persuasive. But there was a reinstitutionalization of the
                    regime, a new constitution, for example, new electoral laws, free and open
                    elections. All those things step by step took place and demarcated a very clear
                    path.</p>

                <p>BARBOUR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it pretty well clear at this point, because at this
                        point we've moved from the Carter administration to the Reagan
                        administration, and by many it was seen, both in the United States and
                        certainly abroad, that all of a sudden you had a turn to the right in
                        foreign affairs, as well as in other things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Well, as you know from your own experience, in foreign affairs you don't
                    get sharp terms ever, usually basic interests remain basic interests. The
                    question is whether you perceive them, and go after them to the same degree, or
                    a lesser degree, and we've talked about some of those things. But there was
                    never any deviation whatsoever from Nixon and Kissinger through Carter to Reagan
                    where we wanted Spain to go, and that was toward the fruition of democratic
                    process. It never ever changed.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: We had to be careful. There were references to Spain's joining NATO,
                    never on the part of American officials, and we usually gulped and...they were
                    said purposely because I suppose from time to time if we thought it important to
                    let it be known that we thought Spain's interests would lie in NATO. We had a
                    joint military planning commission headed by a major general on our part, that
                    had as its purpose to...it was part of one of the base treaties, had as it
                    purpose to modernize Spanish military thinking. And in that forum we were very,
                    very NATO oriented. And they came to be themselves because obviously NATO is the
                    place to be if you want to be a free western European democracy. So these
                    Spanish military saw it, and so we encouraged through this mechanism to see
                    it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Well, France is not in the unified command. But they do participate at
                    the political level. No, indeed not, they thought the Spanish military forces
                    should be completely integrated. In the end they choose for something in between
                    the French model and the foreign integrated one, but they have since moved, I
                    think, in the direction more or less of complete integration.</p>

                <p>BARBOUR: We saw him hopefully because we were told to see him hopefully. We did
                    not know him. Indeed, we received a well informed tip that the new cabinet would
                    be announced that evening in Madrid, and it would be headed by a present
                    minister whose initials were A.S. So we got out the list and there were two
                    people with A.S., and we picked the wrong one. So that's how well we knew him,
                    and what was coming. But when we looked him up, as I said, we knew very little
                    about him, he was very young, Minister of Youth, that sort of thing. We were
                    also told, however he will work with the King, and indeed he did.</p>

                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: Yes. That entire issue had a much lower noise level in Spain than it did

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about bases?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Bases were always an important issue. We had the major base at Terciera
                    for the Air Force, and a major base at Roca for the Navy, and then we had some
                    ancillary facilities around the country. They were governed base agreements, not
                    treaties because we did not want them to be treaties. We did not want to have to
                    submit them for approval by the Senate. We were afraid they might not get
                    passed, so they were agreements. The presence of Terciera was a periodic issue
                    and it even became one during this missile crisis period, you mentioned, when
                    the Spanish media newspapers began to ask, “Is Terciera a threat to Madrid?” and
                    things like that. Well, we told them Terciera could not be reached. One day I
                    remember sitting in my garden at lunch with a socialist senator talking about
                    such things, and I said, “I have to tell you in all honesty that Terciera is not
                    worth a nuclear missile.” He later became Foreign Minister, but that was the
                    case, we didn't think Terciera was worth a strategic missile. Even if they could
                    reach it, which they couldn't. But Terciera for the Air Force and Roca. We had
                    other rights, but they were not of great interest to us.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Portuguese were always using the Azores as a great
                        bargaining chip, but it seems like there is an endless negotiation going on
                        with the Portuguese in which they're trying to get everything they can out
                        of this. I mean they are people who for the last 30 years, or 40 years
                        maybe, have been involved in nothing but these negotiations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: I was involved in the Portuguese negotiations when Frank Carlucci was
                    ambassador. The Portuguese negotiating position was always something like,
                    stated or unstated, it was always something like, go away, we'll renew the
                    agreement, don't worry about that. The question is, what we'll get in exchange
                    for it. And we'd get up to the point where we'd say, “Look, this thing is going
                    to expire, time is running out.” “Well, we understand but what are you prepared
                    to give for it?” The Spanish position, certainly in the round that I was
                    involved in, and much more so later on, was, “Well, we'll see whether you are
                    permitted to stay here.” Our working assumption was that we would but it was a
                    new team, and they were tough negotiators. And one big thing that was going for
                    us was, that by that time the government had stated publicly that it would take
                    Spain into NATO, and these bases would be great assets.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: This was 1984, I guess we signed the last agreement. Todman was still
                    there, so we negotiated for almost a year. These would be great assets to Spain
                    vis-a-vis NATO, and we worked out an agreement. There were some new conditions,
                    some new terms. We got to stay in Terciera, which had been a question, and when
                    it was over Todman and I both told the Department that you'll never get another
                    agreement this good, and you better start thinking about giving up Terciera
                    because it's doubtful we'll get to stay there, and we'll be there five years
                    from now. It was very clear in Spanish attitudes, even with the Spanish
                    military. And when we started putting F-16s...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which were fighter planes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Yes, single engine. We started putting these F-16s into Terciera, and
                    the Spaniards...let me go back a little. For many years we had had at Terciera a
                    wing of Phantom, F- 4s, and the Spaniards had had a wing of Phantoms, F-4s. We
                    had the same aircraft so we had lots of cooperative logistical arrangements.
                    “Got a tire you could lend us.” “Sure.” It made life much easier, this
                    compatibility of equipment. We announced we were putting F-16s into Spain at a
                    time when the Spaniards were themselves considering what successor aircraft they
                    should buy. And after a lot of scouting around, they had narrowed the field down
                    to the F-16, and the F-18, a twin engine longer range aircraft. When they
                    decided to take the F-18 it was clear that this cohabitation was in jeopardy.
                    They had made their own decision, and they would no longer get the benefits of
                    this logistical situation which had been very beneficial, and they didn't want
                    it. They didn't feel the need for it. It was a very clear sign that they meant
                    business, when they kept saying, “You stay in Spain, but we want you away from
                    Madrid.” And indeed, we felt lucky that we were able to get five more years at
                    Terciera. But we said, “You won't get them again.” And indeed, after a lot of
                    unpleasant negotiation, we didn't.</p>

                <p>BARBOUR: We had a Consulate General in Barcelona, we had a Consulate General in
                    Seville, we had consular agencies in Valencia, the Canary Islands, and Certhia.
                    There were about 275 Americans under the ambassador, many of whom were military,
                    and about an equal number of Spanish employees. It was a large mission, not as
                    large as many of them have since become. I think when we were there, we were at
                    least focused.</p>

                <p>BARBOUR: We had very clear foreign policy objectives, very clear. And every time

                    very willing and able to point out and say our foreign policy objectives in
                    Spain are institutionalization of democracy and membership in NATO. But, as I

                </p>
                <p>Today is July 24th, 1995. Bob, we're at the point where I mentioned before. We've
                    got Suriname, then Diplomat in Residence, and you were in Suriname from '84 to
                    '87, then you were Diplomat in Residence, and then you were an inspector. I
                    can't remember if we covered it before, but tell me how that appointment came
                    up.</p>
                <p>BARBOUR: The appointment came up, I guess, in the usual fashion, my experience up
                    to that point was all western European, and bilateral, but the European Bureau,
                    as you know, is not in a position to have much influence on who goes to its
                    posts. And that's how I happened to go to Suriname.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Because it is that bureau in the Department that has the fewest
                    professional ambassadors, always. And sometimes very few indeed. In any case, I
                    wound up going to Suriname which ironically is probably, after French Guinea,
                    the most European part of South America. It's the smallest country in South
                    America, and we had there a small embassy. I might mention that during the
                    confirmation process, which was delayed at the instance of the senior Senator
                    from North Carolina...</p>

                <p>BARBOUR: Yes. One of the alleged objections, which he was said to have, and these
                    were all spurious, was that it was not known whether I spoke Spanish. And I
                    said, “Tell the good Senator that I do, but they don't.” It was not at all an
                    unpleasant assignment, it was not all uninteresting. The country is extremely
                    diverse in its ethnicity, in its origins, in its history, the people are
                    charming, are lovely and the kind of people who could teach all things such as
                    manners and inter-racial relations. We had a very pleasant three years there,
                    demanding, stressful, they were not agreeable, interesting, entertaining they
                    were, we don't regret the three years there at all.</p>

                        Suriname, there had been some concern about Suriname. There had been a coup,
                        and it came about the time when we were getting concerned about Cuban
                        expansion and all that. When you went out there in '84, what did you see as
                        American interests in the area, and American concerns?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: By 1984 the Surinamese situation had settled down. It had gone through a
                    rather blissful period thanks to the Dutch who saw in Suriname, I guess,
                    beginning in 1950s and then in the ''60s, an example they did not want to repeat
                    after their fiasco in Indonesia. Consequently they had spent a lot of money
                    building up Suriname at a time when the major industry, aluminum, was also
                    rising, indeed doing very well on the world market. So that by the mid-1970s
                    Suriname was a very well endowed, very prosperous little country. Well endowed
                    in terms of social infrastructure, well endowed in terms of physical
                    infrastructure. They had a very good civil service, it had a professional police
                    force, it had an educational system, public health system, a telecommunication
                    system, good roads for that part of the world. It was a model, to such an extent
                    that the Dutch about 1975 said to Suriname, “All right, now you can be
                    independent.” And the Surinamese responded, “Not on your life, we like things
                    just the way they are.” So in the end the Dutch bought the Surinamese
                    independence by another billion and a half dollars in forgiven loans, and
                    development grants. Unfortunately, as I recall in 1976, independence was in
                    1976, it was voted by a small majority of the legislative assembly, very small,
                    I think one vote if I'm not mistaken. Some years later after a period of not too
                    successful self administration, the very small army, all Dutch trained of
                    course, the army non-commissioned officers had developed a number of grievances,
                    bread and butter grievances of various kinds, and they decided that they would
                    stage what was later called coup d'etat, but was probably intended to be more in
                    the nature of an armed demonstration. Anyhow, they shook the tree and lo and
                    behold to their astonishment all the fruit came down and fell into their laps,
                    and the country was theirs. They, having been trained in the Netherlands during
                    a period of Dutch radicalism in the universities, and Dutch societies, professed
                    to have very radical ideas themselves, and decided they were all left-wing. They
                    weren't sure, but events showed the accuracy of their doubts just exactly what
                    that meant. But they professed all kinds of left-wing slogans, etc.</p>

                <p>Then in 1982, I forget the exact year, the Bishop in Granada, counted among his
                    few friends in the western hemisphere, the Commandant de facto, autocrat, can't
                    really call him a dictator, autocrat of Suriname, and they made a lot of their
                    friendship. Then you had the trend in Granada we all know about that led to a
                    situation there, that led to our intervention, and that left only Suriname, as
                    you just said, among the states in that part of the world with radical left-wing
                    official views.</p>
                <p>And, of course, along with Bishop, came Castro. That never amounted to anything
                    at all, except in print, and I think there was one visit to Havana during which,
                    of course, the Cubans made a lot of their visitor. But nothing really came of
                    it. Even so, the junta in Suriname was left in charge of the country in the
                    aftermath of Granada, very uncertain of itself, very worried, and then they did
                    a very terrible and stupid thing, they rounded up the corps of the
                    intelligentsia, and murdered them. This I think was 1982, murdered them all
                    which erased all the possibility of the military leaders ever being accepted
                    again in polite western society. The Dutch suspended all of their aid, and we
                    did the same with our minuscule program. And they were left to wallow in this
                    slough of utter darkness that they had created for themselves.</p>
                <p>There had been some internal security concerns there for the safety of the
                    American community, that my predecessor, Bob Duemling, had dealt with very
                    effectively. There had been some minor turbulence within the military which
                    resulted in one of them being found hanged in his cell. So it was not by any
                    means a bright spot on the Caribbean horizon. So I went there in 1984 into that
                    kind of situation. What were our interests at that time? Not many. They were
                    strategic you might say to try to do what was possible to eliminate that stain
                    on the Caribbean ascription. They were commercial, to do what we could to help
                    Alcoa, which ran Alcoa, the Surinamese aluminum company. And to give democratic
                    elements every possible helping hand. So that's when I went.</p>
                <p>Our introduction to Suriname was significant in that...there's only one airline
                    connection between the United States and Suriname, and that is Suriname
                    Airlines, SLM. So when we were going there, we arranged to take our dog whom we
                    turned over to the airlines here, had him transferred him to Suriname Airlines
                    in Miami, and we stopped off for a couple of days in Haiti, just for a kind of
                    orientation. While we were there we received a cable from SLM saying, “Fear not,
                    your dog will be on board, and so will Mr. Van who will look after him and meet
                    you on your airplane's arrival in Port-au-Prince. This, I must say, is rather
                    typical of Surinamese way of doing things. I started off by saying that they're
                    wonderful people, and indeed they are.</p>
                <p>The President paid an unofficial personal visit to New York during that summer,
                    and my wife and I went up and took him and his family out to lunch, very
                    informal, very personal. Our daughter came along and we had a very convivial,
                    jovial, happy time. It was also part of our introduction to Suriname.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask a question. Here is this government which had
                        in the recent past slaughtered the elite of the country and you're taking
                        one of the men who was responsible for that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Here we had, on the one hand, this terrible image of a government which
                    had slaughtered the intelligentsia. In fact, it was a kind of para-government.
                    By that time the military had allowed into prominence again a civilian
                    government. A President, a Prime Minister, a cabinet, all civilians, and all
                    officially unconnected with the military. So we chose to deal with the
                    government. But I did go there, and this period when Suriname had its dark aura
                    about it, and I give you these two introductory notes because they were quite
                    different from the image that Suriname enjoyed in Washington. So we assumed the
                    image was correct, and these pleasant realities were aberrations.</p>
                <p>Shortly after we arrived we were invited to the installation of the new trade
                    union leadership which was to have been held at the presidential palace. And I
                    thought I would go to that. I was certain these were all the left-wing voices we
                    had heard so much about, that it would be nice to see what these radicals really
                    looked like. So I went. As we stood on the broad white veranda of the
                    president's official residence looking out over the grass and the park, the
                    labor leaders arrived and took their places on the other side, and I noticed one
                    of them was wearing, not a T-shirt, a sweat shirt which said, “America,” on the
                    front. And then as we waited the band struck up Amazing Grace, and in came the
                    president with the appropriate ministers, and they had their ceremony, and after
                    that there was a reception, and I had a chance to speak to some of these labor
                    leaders, and found them extremely congenial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we in consultation with the Dutch, because this had
                        been their bailiwick for so long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: The Dutch had an ambassador there, a very active, a very impressive
                    ambassador, the French were there, Indians, Chinese, Russians, various others.
                    The Dutch were looking after their vestigial interests, maintaining a presence,
                    maintaining a flag and with it hope that better days would come back. They were
                    like the French in much of French Africa, very present, very much a factor, but
                    very low key and not actively or directly involved in many things, and do things
                    that they did participate in officially, for example. Anyhow, I give you these
                    elements of introduction because our whole stay in Suriname was marked by this
                    congeniality, this enormous good humored dignity that the Surinamese have, that
                    made our stay there very pleasant. I mean, I had contact whenever I desired with
                    anybody there. I obviously visited them from time to time, I visited the
                    military commander, who like everybody else there, was unfailingly
                    courteous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But he was the de facto leader for so long.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: He was the power behind the throne, and undoubtedly responsible for the
                    murder that I frequently as we talked, had in the back of my mind, is it
                    possible that this person can have such bloody hands. In our very first meeting
                    he asked whether American policies, and Dutch policies, were the same. And I
                    said, “No, they're not the same, but,” I said, “and I know you don't like to
                    hear this, we do come together on the question of civil rights in this country.”
                    So we talked about human rights. And he listened very courteously, and then he
                    said, “You're quite right, I don't like to have that question put at me that
                    way. But I asked the question, and you gave me a fair answer.” We never had any
                    difficulty dealing, even when the topic of our conversation was the sort of
                    thing that those on the receiving end don't like to hear. But they were always
                    pleasant, always very courteous, as were all our dealings in that country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the Reagan administration when you
                        were there, whose approach to human rights was much more low key than that
                        of the Carter administration. Did you find that Suriname was just so far off
                        the political radar that nobody was paying any attention to it, or were
                        there human rights abuses, people in jail or what have you, that we were
                        pushing on, or anything of that nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: The situation got worse later on. In human rights policies the Reagan
                    administration were less activists than during the Carter administration, but
                    they were no less present. It was a significant element of our policy interests
                    in Suriname to push for them. Later on in the latter years of our stay there, a
                    small civil war developed, insurrection of a man, which generated a reaction
                    inside Paramaribo, and in the countryside, troops would go in and there would be
                    killings, and rampaging, and things like that by the army. We began to have more
                    acute civil rights problems, and we began to talk openly about them. Then there
                    were arrests, there were even killings, never objectively documented. Let's just
                    say we were involved in doing what we could about them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did we do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: Well, in public and in private. And the nice thing about dealing with
                    people like the Surinamese, you can say what you want to say. You can say what
                    needs to be said, and so can they, and they don't get offended, you don't get
                    offended. But I remember talking to the Prime Minister once about a column in
                    one of the newspapers that was written by a local Protestant minister, a very
                    witty column, very amusing, but telling in its barbs. The Prime Minister said,
                    “Well, we're going to bring him in here.” And I said, “Oh, that's fine. Let's
                    see you'll have human rights, you'll have freedom of the press, and you'll have
                    religious issues, all in one bundle. That's really great.” He said, “Maybe we'll
                    just give him a talking to.” Anyhow, I think that sort of thing is called
                    interventions, we had lots of interventions of that kind which really, if we
                    succeeded in dampening down some of their intentions to take reprisals, they
                    served our purpose. We also went public. I gave one local talk on it, I wrote a
                    letter to the editor of the newspaper shortly before I left, and the issue was
                    human rights. It was there, and it was a factor. Libyans came in. The military
                    decided they didn't have any friends anywhere, they might as well have the
                    Libyans, and of course, Qadhafi promised them all kinds of things. So he went to
                    Tripoli, and the Libyans came and set up a—what did they call it—an Islamic
                    Society, which was right down the street from my residence, and one of my new
                    assignments, self assumed, was to get them out of there. And I had a lot of
                    talks on the issue, I never succeeded in getting them out. But again, you could
                    deal frankly with them. I would say to the Prime Minister, or the President, or
                    the Foreign Minister, “Why don't you just throw them out, they're not doing you
                    any good. They're coloring your image, nobody around here wants them. The
                    Guianese don't want them here, the French don't want them here. Why don't you
                    just throw them out?” They didn't, but at least you can't say that we didn't
                    administer our points.</p>
                <p>There was an internal security situation that came up once, and I called on the
                    Surinamese commander about it. It concerned a Libyan trigger man who came into
                    town. We knew it, we followed him around...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A hit man, an assassin.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: ...a trigger man. We knew him, we knew when he came in, we knew he was,
                    we knew he'd been around to look at the embassy. We had a good deal of interest
                    in why he might be there. This was after the April attack on Tripoli, April
                    1984.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When we bombed Tripoli.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: In reprisal for the night club bombing in Berlin. That's right. Shortly
                    after that this fellow arrived. Mind you, I never had any instructions for
                    dealing with the Surinamese. I had carte blanche to say whatever I thought
                    needed to be said. So in this case I went to see Colonel (inaudible), and I
                    said, “We know this man is here. We know who he is. We know that he was given a
                    visa and was permitted to come in.” And I said very pleasantly, “And I think you
                    should know that if anything happens to any American here, you will be held
                    responsible by my government.” He didn't react really. I said, “But anyhow, here
                    is his name.” And I gave him the card on it. And that afternoon, I guess it was
                    lunch time, I was home, and somebody dropped by to see me, and said, “He's
                    leaving tomorrow at noon.” Which was good. It was good in another way which has
                    since become known in that we were able to follow him around, he was arrested in
                    another country, and we got a whole suitcase of all his paraphernalia, and all
                    his documents and things like that. So that was nice. But the point is not that
                    we scored this counter intelligence coup, but the fact that we could talk to the
                    Surinamese in that kind of manner without giving offense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place, was there a difference did you find
                        between the civilian side of the government, and the military side of the
                        government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: No, but there became a more difference later on. I will give you another
                    little anecdote, a little revealing anecdote, and then I'll tell you about the
                    difference. The relations with the military junta were officially chilly.
                    Personally in a little place like Paramaribo, you run into everybody all the
                    time. So, in fact, we talked to them. I've had some of them privately to lunch
                    to talk to them. Relations were not bad. And we knew when they'd go off to Miami
                    and have a weekend in Miami on the town, and come back. So we gave a visa to one
                    of them, he went off to Miami with his girlfriend. And about 2:30 one morning,
                    the Foreign Minister called me and said he had something urgent, and asked if I
                    could go to see him. The Foreign Minister calls, you go, unless he makes a habit
                    of calling at 2:30 in the morning. So I went to see him. And he said, “Can you
                    tell me, Mr. Ambassador, why Captain (inaudible) has been arrested?” Captain
                    (inaudible) was a member of junta, I hadn't the faintest notion. My first
                    reaction was that he and his girlfriend were on the town and he'd gotten into a
                    fight in a bar. And I said, “No, I haven't the faintest idea, I'm sure it's
                    nothing political.” So anyhow, I had no telegram, I had no information, I had no
                    nothing, but during the course of the night I found out that he had been
                    arrested in a DEA sting operation. Arrested, taped, filmed, and everything else.
                    He had been the willing participant of a sting operation showing that he, as a
                    member of the Surinamese junta, was willing to open up the country to drug
                    trafficking. So it was all on tape as he negotiated prices, and entry points,
                    and things like that.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>But by the opening of business the next day, the morning newspaper and the radio
                    all had scare stories about an American plot against Suriname. Little did they
                    know, Suriname was not a country we had ever plotted against, but the CIA was
                    involved, and the Americans were all against Suriname, and they were even
                    hinting of big demonstrations, and stir up the people. So at that point too I
                    went around to see Colonel (inaudible), and at the end of the morning he agreed
                    to receive me. We talked about it and I gave him the information.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got the information from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: By phone, scarce as it was, and I gave it to him and I said, “Now what I
                    want you to know is that we only know what we know, and it concerns Capt.
                    (inaudible). And this campaign that is being stirred up, all these allegations,
                    the excitement, really doesn't do anybody any good because at this point we only
                    know what we know.” Meaning we don't know anything about anybody else. And the
                    Colonel, who was no fool, got the point 100%, and without batting an eye, “Oh,
                    well, in this case the Foreign Minister is not speaking for the government.” And
                    that was the end of it. The afternoon newspaper, evening television, nada. It
                    was a minor affair. I went that afternoon when I went to play tennis, I was a
                    national hero because the civilian elements of the country, in or out of
                    government...in government worked with the military either under duress, out of
                    fear, or because they made a lot of money on the side. Outside the government
                    the civilian element hated the military, but tolerated it. But we were careful
                    not to seem opposed or any threat and you had this element of forces who existed
                    there, co-existed, and until this little civil war started, co-existing with
                    amazing congeniality.</p>
                <p>But when we were there I would add on a personal note, one could travel all over
                    the country, and Suriname at that time was 99% virgin Amazonian jungle.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we see the Soviets and the Chinese doing anything
                        there that we considered...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: I could never figure out why the Soviets were there, except I guess they
                    were sucked in on the coattails of Castro, and Bishop. The Soviet ambassador
                    was, I think, basically a well-intentioned person. His wife made no bones at all
                    about her feelings toward the regime at home. She was quite outspoken, and spent
                    as little time in Suriname with her husband as possible, was therefore a
                    pleasure to be around when she was there. The Chinese were there, I think,
                    because they had a sense of mission. They'd built a lovely sports complex in the
                    Chinese fashion. They said, “Which would you like to have? A stadium, airport
                    terminal, or the various things they have in their catalogue. The Surinamese
                    chose a stadium, which is a large complex. The Chinese said, “Let's see, this is
                    July 1, 1981, it'll take 18 months, and we'll let you know what we need.” In
                    Chinese fashion doing things in a country like Suriname, they need very little.
                    Everything and everybody is important except the basic laborer, and they
                    delivered it on time, just as they said using Chinese workers, Chinese
                    engineers, Chinese design, Chinese raw materials, Chinese prefabricated
                    materials, and that was that. So why they were there, I never figured out.</p>

                        that when you had a government that was essentially repressive, our
                        missionaries very quickly find themselves at odds with them because they're
                        supporting their laity who are usually being oppressed. Was this a

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: The missionaries there kept out of politics entirely. They had their
                    feelings, of course, but they were totally apolitical. The Surinamese church,
                    Dutch Reform, Mennonite, much more active. There is a kind of national church in
                    Suriname, and it is the Dutch church. As I said, one of their ministers wrote a
                    newspaper column, his wife worked in the embassy which occasionally made it
                    inconvenient. The head of the church, the pastor, gave delightful sermons, full
                    of innuendo, lots of little asides that must have made the military squirm, but
                    they would sometimes go as dutiful churchgoers, would sit in the audience and
                    find all this acceptable within the limits of the convinuality that reigned in
                    Suriname.</p>

                <p>BARBOUR: No, Suriname was essentially off our screen, that's the reason I never

                    as I said, I could make such representations as I felt the situation called for,

                <p>BARBOUR: They had lost interest in Castro. They saw that Cuba was no model for

                    maintained an embassy there, there was no Cuban embassy Paramaribo. No, they did

                <p>BARBOUR: Your question reveals you know a lot more about this subject than you
                    would think. It was given far more credit than it deserved. There was always the
                    possibility, and I guess the conviction in the circumstances you just described,
                    the Americans might indeed come charging in some day, who knows. They didn't
                    realize how unimportant Suriname was to us.</p>

                        probably send a battalion in and do a number, but then what? and there we
                        are. And is it worth it? And the answer came back, no. Granada served as a
                        certain sign saying things can go just so far, and the United States can do
                        something.</hi>

                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: What we had was very small anyway in objective terms. We did have an
                    USIS operation. We did an IVP, an International Visitors Program, I think we had
                    six or eight a year of visitors we sent to the United States, obviously chosen
                    to further the causes that we were supporting there, democratization and human
                    rights and things like that, as well as occasionally technical grants. They were
                    all very effective. We didn't have cultural presentations, I think we were
                    simply not on the circuit for those. We had an occasional speaker. No, it was
                    not entirely off the screen, it was just too far down on the list of priorities
                    to merit much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you left had the civil war was going, did we
                        have any particular interest or concern about the civil war one way or the
                        other?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: At that time we were concerned by its implications. The army reacted
                    very harshly. Just before it broke out we had been authorized to offer a small
                    IMET program, International Military Education and Training, and to that end we
                    had offered an English language laboratory which included when it was assembled
                    some instructors in training programs, and things like that. That was a big
                    change. I had offered it to Barza, and he had leaped at it with alacrity, and
                    this at a time when the military were slowly withdrawing from political life and
                    letting the civilian government act more and more on its own. The trend was
                    somewhat encouraging. Anyhow, the first thing we did was cancel that program.
                    Our interests were really to keep out of it. They hired an American helicopter,
                    they chartered it with a couple of soldiers of fortune on board. They brought it
                    over from, I think, down through French Guinea, brought it in the back door,
                    brought it into action against Brunswick, and then the first day of operation it
                    was shot down. Therefore, there ended American involvement.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have American mercenaries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: We did. One was killed in the crash, the other was injured and was
                    hospitalized—the French got involved and one of the men got killed. Anyhow, one
                    or both were hospitalized for a while. They were working for the government, the
                    military, and no reason for the Surinamese to be unkind to them. So, no, we did
                    not have a problem. The military Attach� saw them a couple of times and that was
                    that. They didn't want to have anything to do with us, and we were quite happy
                    when they left.</p>

                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: Not really. The Dutch were, I think, unofficially backing the rebels.
                    There were Dutch soldiers of fortune involved. It was all a micro-war, the
                    number of people involved never more than a couple of hundred on each side. A
                    big operation would be a couple of hundred people on both sides. But it was in
                    the jungle. Unfortunately they blew up the bridges to French Guinea, and they
                    cut down power lines, and they did unfortunate things. And the situation in the
                    capital, Paramaribo, needless to say got rather tense from time to time. There
                    were rumors of eruptions into the city, but they didn't take place. We became
                    more concerned about you might say law and order in the city, but in fact we
                    never had any reason to feel injured by the situation.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: It was going downhill, had been going downhill economically ever since
                    the little war started which is probably about a year, and therefore had been
                    going downhill politically. There were political tensions between the military
                    and the civilians had increased including between the military and the civilian
                    government. And then the military had agreed that there could be elections.
                    These elections were free and open. There was a large coalition against the
                    military. The military ran as a party, that is they and their supporters ran as
                    a party. There was a coalition party of, you might say, the Creoles and the
                    Hindustanis, the Indians, you might say the commercial and the white collar
                    elements, it was a big alliance. The campaign was open. The coalition had a very
                    catchy campaign song, it was charming. And, of course, they triumphed. They got
                    82-83 percent of the vote. I left just before the vote. I decided I would not
                    stay through the voting. My successor was due to follow and I thought this is a
                    good time to break. But they got that overwhelming percentage. And I left then
                    personally on a note of hope that a new political scenario was being created,
                    that this new coalition would take over with a civilian government, with real
                    political backing, and it would gradually impose itself vis-a-vis the military.
                    Well, unfortunately it didn't gradually impose itself, or if it did, it did so
                    with such gentleness that it was hard to see it. Corruption increased, drug
                    trafficking began. This little insurgent army in the bush itself got involved in
                    the country and things became much worse in the country. I ended on a good note
                    but it was not justified.</p>

                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: I went to Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia as you might
                    say, officially a Diplomat in Residence. In fact, as a foreign affairs adviser
                    to a special program of 20 students that had been created within the university.
                    I had not been keen on going there, but they told me, they being here at FSI,
                    that Marshall University had put together with private funds what they hoped
                    would turn out to be a mini-Rhodes Scholar program endorsed by General Chuck
                    Yeager, given his name, Yeager Scholars Foundation with 20 scholars rigorously
                    selected. And they hoped very much they could have a Diplomat in Residence. It
                    sounded interesting in that context. What they wanted was someone with the title
                    of ambassador to give the program some eclat. I knew that. They telephoned me
                    several times in Suriname, some of the boosters, calling to encourage, to urge,
                    to incite my interest in the program. And I remember one conversation by a local
                    businessman who said, “What kind of sports do you play?” “Well, you know, here
                    it's basketball, then football, we'll get you some tickets to the football
                    games.” “What kind of sports do you play?” And I said, “My wife and I play
                    tennis.” “Well, we'll get you membership to the Country Club,” which they did.
                    “We'll give you a house,” which they did. And then he said, “Do you need a car?”
                    And I said, “No, we'll have a car.” But it was in that kind of atmosphere that
                    we went. Huntington, West Virginia, a small city, western hub of railroads in
                    the 19th century named after Mr. Huntington who developed, I think, the Western
                    Pacific.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Indeed, he was. Well, he endowed Marshall University, what became
                    Marshall University, or contributed heavily to it, and to a lot of other good
                    things there. He got the city named after him. And off I went to Huntington,
                    West Virginia. The railroad yard is still a parking lot for a lot of private
                    railroad cars among other things. Very much Appalachia. A part of the United
                    States that neither my wife and I had ever been exposed to, interesting enough
                    but very sad. Very much on the economic downturn. When we were there the
                    population of the city was about 15,000 less than it had been some years before,
                    and even then stores were closing, factories were shutting down, people were
                    moving away. Very sad, and it happened while we were there. Main Street was
                    closing up. But I must say, such wonderful people. You could go, you could leave
                    your car unparked, you didn't need to worry about locking your front door, if
                    you forgot it, nothing would happen to it. If you ordered something from a store
                    and you weren't going to be there to receive it, “we'll leave it on the front
                    porch”—all houses there have front porches, and swings. It was a nice
                    atmosphere.</p>

                <p>Foreign affairs is not high on the Marshall University list of priorities, so
                    after installing ourselves in the university, we were left to develop our own
                    program. Now, in many universities it consists of teaching regularly and giving
                    rarefied lectures on some aspects of foreign affairs. Well, that wasn't what
                    people there wanted to hear. I gave some lectures on international law. I took a
                    class while a professor was away. I gave foreign affairs lectures, some of the
                    international relations courses at nearby universities and colleges, the Rotary
                    Club, or the Kiwanis Club, clubs of Huntington, and nearby towns. What they
                    really wanted was about the Foreign Service. And I found them interested in the
                    Foreign Service, and unbelievably sympathetic in people to the institution. I
                    was amazed. But those were the questions they asked, not about how did we do it,
                    what did we think about perestroika, what was the American reaction to glasnost.
                    No, they wanted to know what life in the Foreign Service was like. They were
                    very congenial, very pleasant. I had the nicest office I ever had anyplace. But
                    it was clear that one term was really about all they needed there. They had had
                    their title, and I therefore agreed to come back and be an inspector. I had
                    hoped to go back to Europe, but that fell through for you might say the reasons
                    one learns to live with. And I came back and became an inspector where I have
                    unretired and now retired and been ever since.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was from 1988 to the present?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: As an inspector. I came back in April of 1988, went off with a colleague
                    to understudy him for a week in Copenhagen, and then took my own team off and
                    did my first two inspections which fortunately, and no doubt by design, were
                    very easy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Since this covers a vast thing, but I would like to get a
                        feel before we end this...here you were a long-time veteran of the Foreign
                        Service, how did you find when you came in, because there had been some
                        tremendous changes in '88, can you characterize your view of the inspections
                        at that time, and the atmosphere, and attitude?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: Sherman Funk was the Inspector General. He brought with him a new team.
                    He vastly enlarged the office of the Inspector General, creating an office of
                    investigations, doing work that had formerly been done by SY or DS, creating an
                    office of audits to do program audits, and giving unintentionally to the
                    inspection function a benevolent cast causing us to be seen, I think, certainly
                    in the first years of his Inspector Generalship, an atmosphere that we were in
                    fact like the investigators that to our purpose was to catch people doing wrong,
                    and punish them for it. In other words, the changeover when Bill Harrop left and
                    Helms put in the stipulation that the Inspector General could not be a member of
                    the Foreign Service. The legislation that gave him more power to increase in the
                    inspectorial bureaucracy, all I think had a chilling effect initially on
                    relations between the Foreign Service and the inspection institution. That had
                    worn off to some extent in the year that elapsed between its beginning and my
                    entry onto the scene. Certainly that point of view was not that of the people
                    who were inspecting. At that time there was also taking place something which
                    was more difficult to digest and that was the addition of Civil Service
                    inspectors, including at somewhat senior levels. That was more difficult and
                    caused a lot more suspicion. But the inspection itself had not really changed
                    from what it had been, and that is an in-house look at how an embassy goes about
                    carrying out its foreign policy obligations, and using the money and people that
                    are made available to carry out its foreign policy obligations. That hadn't
                    changed. Nor had the attitude changed. In fact, to me it was quite clear that we
                    really saw ourselves, my colleagues as I entered new onto the scene, saw
                    themselves as management consultants. Our purpose was not to catch people doing
                    wrong. Our purpose was to correct errors if we found any. But to be a team that
                    went out and gave a disinterested, but I insist, in-house look at this
                    particular institution of a post, or a bureau, and give it our reaction. Now
                    obviously the reaction frequently contains things that an ambassador or an
                    assistant secretary doesn't want to hear. But they were, in fact, well intended.
                    That has changed somewhat over the past couple of years, not in the psychology,
                    but in the purpose as things in the Department have gotten tougher. Especially
                    now teams are not enjoined, but feel much more obliged to identify savings and
                    things like that. That was always an element, but you didn't go saying, “This is
                    embassy X, let's see if we can't reduce it by ten positions.” Posts frequently
                    assumed we went with that mandate, but it wasn't true at all. If we could find
                    places where there could be reductions, we recommended them. Or if we found
                    there were places where increases were needed, we recommended them too. I think
                    things are a little more difficult now because everybody, both the inspection
                    process and inspection institution, and the inspected entities, are going
                    through a rather tough period. Nonetheless, we continue to look upon ourselves
                    mostly as consultants with the purpose of helping the thing, the inspector
                    entity, do its job better.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>My experience has been that let's say 80 percent of the time, the posts are glad
                    we have been there, after we're gone they're glad, because we are a kind of a
                    pain in the neck while we're there. But after we've gone, I think, they're glad
                    that we've come. And it's ironic, one of the complaints that the new Inspector
                    General has received since he's been there, is that the inspections are too
                    infrequent. They are slipping into four and five years now. We do think that
                    we're a friend of the post. I sometimes use the analogy of a physical
                    examination. You'd really not have it but you know you've got to have it, and
                    you want people to tell you the truth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It used to be in the old days when the inspectors arrived,
                        it was often the saving grace for junior officers because the inspectors
                        could give a little different aspect. If you had a senior rating officer who
                        was not well disposed, and maybe...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: You still have that option. Again, we write inspector's evaluations, we
                    write an evaluation of an ambassador, and the DCM, the chief of mission, all
                    principal officers and assistant secretaries and deputies. We can also write
                    evaluations on anyone if they are corrective because we find they're not doing
                    the good job that was described in the evaluation, or in fact that the
                    evaluation is unfair. And we write both kinds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that struck me looking at this since I
                        retired is, this huge audit organization, huge compared with what we used to
                        have, and if you have something like this, this is an animal that has to be
                        fed. The State Department per se, it's real money, but it's not a money
                        intensive organization compared to many other organizations and it doesn't
                        look to me like the audit people might be...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBOUR: Well, the audit function...we do spend a lot of money, we don't spend it
                    on salaries and expenses, but we do spend a lot of money. The Department of
                    State appropriation that they talk about is a lot of money, and it does include
                    programs which we didn't used to have. The audits are programs. They will look
                    at a function, and they do audits of some INM and narcotics programs, which are
                    operational and spend a lot of money. They will look at the visa function. We
                    don't look at the visa function except in the context of a particular post. They
                    will look at the function world-wide. They will look at allowances, the
                    allowance program, how it's organized, how it's administered. They did one on
                    voucher processing, which I hope is going to lead to some great simplification.
                    So they do programs. We don't do programs, and one of the things we stress is
                    that we're not auditors, and we're not investigators. We are the same old garden
                    variety inspector that most people in the Service have grown up with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any good inspection stories? Horror stories,
                        good stories, what have you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: Well, I'll give you, without identities, things where I think we have
                    done some very good things. There was one post that was a beneficiary of
                    unappropriated money. And it tried with, I think, sincerity, to spend them
                    correctly in pursuit of foreign policy operations. But in doing so it had over
                    time dug itself into some enormous holes, some of which were becoming very
                    doubtful. Well, we spent a lot of time with that place, and I think we helped it
                    get right with the regulations and prevented it from getting itself, itself
                    being the people involved starting with the head of the post, the chief of
                    mission, from getting himself into some circumstances that could have been
                    extremely awkward with the GAO, and maybe even with the legislation. We did
                    that.</p>
                <p>Another place we found that a chief of mission was...well, was beating up on his
                    staff. We did a special inspection of that post for the specific purpose of
                    finding out what the problems were, and spending long hours with him as to how
                    it was not to his advantage to continue to behave as he had been behaving. I
                    think we got a good hearing.</p>
                <p>We saw posts that had gone off the tracks as far as its purpose in life. The
                    chief of mission, a very nice fellow, had no idea what he was there to do. We
                    got him some policy directives that he did not have, and we worked with him to
                    help carry out foreign policy. I think we did some good there.</p>
                <p>These are isolated very vague examples. We don't go into a place and say, “Okay,
                    everybody line up, we're here, we're going to straighten this place out.”
                    Because we realize that in most embassies everybody is slugging away in good
                    will, doing the best they can, sometimes under very difficult circumstances. And
                    we go back to what I said earlier, we go in with the hope that we can be of
                    assistance to them in doing their jobs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is your impression of the use of the patronage system
                        to appoint political ambassadors? I mean some ambassadors might be called
                        political ambassadors, but they come with credentials that are such that
                        they can move right in. But there are a good number of ambassadors who come
                        in as political appointees who come from completely different environment.
                        One of the things must have been the problem of the fit between these and
                        your career Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>BARBOUR: I don't know how many posts I've inspected over the past three years,
                    and preceding experiences, I have the very distinct impression that most
                    political ambassadors do no harm. A few are good, are serious about really
                    pursuing the given foreign policy objectives, not the ones they prefer to
                    operate in. But the real foreign policy objectives, they are responsive, they
                    are disciplined, and they pursue them either with innate ability, or as you
                    indicate, some acquired professionalism for whatever reason. And they do have
                    some that are just plain bad. They become embarrassments. This is a small
                    percentage. They become embarrassments, frequently untouchable though. They
                    decide that what they are really there to do is not what their instructions or
                    whatever the Department of State tells them, but what the White House wants
                    which may be...and this which of course sounds great, but may not be our real
                    interest in that country, or certainly not the principal interest, when they
                    have other things. And our principal interest is always national security, we
                    may have national security interests that really should come first, and they
                    decide for whatever reasons, no. This is a small percentage. Some are bad, some
                    are good, most do no harm. A political chief of mission is usually better than a
                    professional Foreign Service officer in public diplomacy.</p>
