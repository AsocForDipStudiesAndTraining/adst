                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 13th of January, 1999. This is an interview
                        with S. Douglas Martin, and is being done on behalf of the Association for
                        Diplomatic Studies and Training. I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Doug, let's start at the very beginning. Tell me when and where you were born and
                    something about your parents.</p>
                <p>MARTIN: I was born December 6, 1926, in Brooklyn, New York, in the Norwegian
                    Hospital, now the Lutheran Medical Center. My parents were John F. Martin and
                    Helen Girard Toglund. My father was a policeman. He was born in 1890, not too
                    far from the Lutheran Medical Center, maybe two miles away, down below Fourth
                    Avenue in Brooklyn; and my mother was born in Greenwich Village in Manhattan in
                    1898. My father went through eighth grade and had about 21 jobs before he was
                    21. Then he began training for the New York City Police Department, [and] became
                    a cop and eventually a detective. He retired from the New York City Police
                    Department in 1944 or the beginning of '45. I think he had 31 years service at
                    that time. Later he went on to become a checker on the docks in Brooklyn and
                    worked for another 19 years. Then he retired, and died in 1970.</p>
                <p>My mother was born in 1898, as I say. Her father was also a policeman, a sergeant
                    of police in the New York City Police Department. He was a traffic policeman at
                    the Ferry Slip in Manhattan, and eventually, against his wishes and desires, he
                    was transferred to Brooklyn. So in my family, we always had a Brooklyn group -
                    my father and his sister - and a New York group - my mother and her parents, my
                    grandmother, who was alive (I never really knew my grandfather, who died a
                    couple of years after I was born). When my mother went shopping, she always went
                    to Manhattan, and my aunt always went to Downtown Brooklyn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One always thinks of the New York Police Department as
                        being very Irish. Do you consider yourself Irish, English, or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>MARTIN: All of my great-grandparents, eight of them, were born in Ireland, and
                    all came to the United States. The first one came in 1846. [They were] Patrick
                    and Bridget Martin. They were 23 and 21 years old. They came from Northern
                    Ireland, but I don't know the town; I'm trying to trace it now. My mother's
                    family came later, around the Civil War, and they were from the south of
                    Ireland. In fact, there used to be a dispute in my family whether they were from
                    Knock or a place called Kilmurray McMahon. When I researched it, I found out
                    Kilmurray McMahon was the Catholic Church parish, and the hamlet - it's really a
                    hamlet of about 30 houses - in Knock, which means 'hill' in Ireland. There are
                    many places named Knock. It's not the famous Knock which is a shrine. Not that
                    one. It's a place. It's right on the estuary of the Shannon River. It's a very
                    boggy area, in County Clare.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me, let's talk a bit about growing up as a cop's kid
                        in Brooklyn. There have been books and movies and all made about this era.
                        Can you tell me what it was like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: We never had any thought that we were disadvantaged, or that being a
                    cop's son or in a cop's family was anything but the best. Because my father had
                    only an eighth grade education, he considered himself very lucky that he had
                    become a policeman and even luckier that he had become a detective, something
                    that had a little higher cachet to it. You know, people talk today about low
                    self-esteem. There's no self-esteem in my family, even though others might think
                    it; we think of ourselves as somebody special, all of us, and I think people in
                    the neighborhood did to. To be that was to have status, to have a certain
                    prestige.</p>
                <p>My mother had it even more so, because my mother had an education. She had gone
                    to Bay Ridge High School, where girls in that neighborhood went, and she was a
                    personality. She finished high school and became a registered nurse, something
                    she was very proud of. She had practiced as a nurse, and then as a school nurse
                    at the time that she got married. When she started having children, she stopped
                    working, which my father expected. He understood that. Then when World War II
                    came along, my mother, who was a real personality, had a friend who was running
                    a nurses' service and kept calling my mother, “Please come back to work. There's
                    such a desperate shortage of nurses.” My mother wanted to do that, and
                    eventually she did. My father was upset by that, but my mother went back to work
                    one day a week and then sometimes a couple of days, taking individual cases.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>But we had a special thing in my family because I'm a twin - not an identical
                    twin, but a fraternal twin - and my brother had cerebral palsy, although they
                    didn't diagnose it then. He was never able to walk or talk. When he was about 12
                    years old, he was able to move around the house a little bit. He started to do
                    that. And he could say a few words. But he was home all the time, and as one of
                    my brothers-in-law said, he was like a pet in the family. Everybody loved him,
                    everybody acknowledged him, but he just really was unable to do anything. This
                    had a certain advantage because in every neighborhood, there are children who
                    are retarded, disadvantaged, or whatever, and very often they get into trouble
                    with the police or cause problems for the family. My brother never caused any
                    problems at all.</p>
                <p>My father's name was John. My brother's name was John. I was named after my
                    uncle, who was a world champion dancer. He was in show business, and he met my
                    aunt when my aunt was a singer. The two of them teamed up as Doug and Clare.
                    When my mother was expecting, he said, “Gee, you're awfully big. Maybe you'll
                    have twins.” My mother didn't know then. He said, “Will you name one after me if
                    you have twins?” She said, “If it's a boy, I'm going to name it John.” So
                    anyway, my brother got named John because when we were born, he was the stronger
                    one and was first born, and I was born next, and so they named me Doug. But you
                    had to have a saint's name, so that name was Stephen. But his name was Stephen,
                    too. So I was Stephen Douglas Martin.</p>
                <p>They claimed that there was a legend in the family that, because they were rabid
                    Democrats, he was named after Stephen Douglas. I doubt if that's true, but my
                    uncle used to tell stories. He was a great one for that. He had been in show
                    business, traveled all around the country and had even signed up the group to go
                    to England, which turned out to be a disaster. He knew people in show business,
                    Fred Allen, for example, who was also Irish, and my uncle Doug and his brother,
                    by the name John, once had - show business people are always broke - Fred Allen
                    stay with them in the hotel, and then they were sneaking out, trying to get him
                    out without paying the hotel. Fred Allen mentioned that in his autobiography - I
                    read it one time - and it mentions Doug and John Hargreave, who were dancers.
                    And he knew some other people. He knew George Burns and Gracie Allen. He was on
                    the same bill with them once. He was on the same bill with George M. Cohan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the era of Vaudeville.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes. Now that's the story of my mother, because when vaudeville died,
                    from one month to the next, he was out of work. My father used to call him a
                    “cellar door dancer”; he was a tap dancer, but he could do all kinds of dancing.
                    He was Irish reel champion of America in 1911 and Irish jig champion in 1910. He
                    had different certificates, and he was a champion dancer, and he really was a
                    great dancer. He had all kinds of pictures, you know, that show business people
                    had. So my mother said, “Okay, you're out of a job. You've got to do something.
                    Why don't you start a dancing school?” He said okay, and they rented a place,
                    which they kept for many, many years, on the second floor of a two-story
                    building on Ovington Avenue and Fifth Avenue in Brooklyn. And my mother was the
                    one - because, as I say, she was a great personality and knew many people - who
                    went around to friends of the family and said, “Doug Hargreave's starting a
                    dancing school. Could you send your daughter to learn?” And the dancing school
                    was an instantaneous success. From then on, right through the depression - that
                    would have been about 1932 so right through the depression, they made between
                    $75 and $300 a week, of which, of course, being Uncle Doug, he never saved a
                    penny. Later on, when he couldn't work any more, when the dancing school
                    business faded out - which was not until 1950, I guess, then he was actually on
                    welfare, and he died. I remember visiting him in the hospital as he was dying -
                    and he told me, “Don't worry, don't worry.” He was always an optimistic, upbeat
                    kind of a guy. As I say, low self-esteem does not run in my family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get stories about police work and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Oh, yes, yes. My grandfather did something, and it parallels the State
                    Department, and what happened to Foreign Service officers. When he was about to
                    retire, after he had about 35 years' service, he used to interview police
                    applicants, because to get onto the New York Police Department, you had to pass
                    a character and fitness exam. You had to be interviewed, and then he would go
                    around to the neighborhood and do what later on we'd call a “neighborhood check”
                    and then give the okay that the person was all right. Well, one of my last
                    assignments was on the Board of Examiners, and we had all these guys in what
                    they call “the elephants' graveyard,” but it was a job I loved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, it's a great job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: It was an absolutely great assignment, and even though I was over
                    complement - you say, “Over complement oh, isn't that too bad.” No. To be over
                    complement very often means you get to do what has to be done that they never
                    really planned for, and it was great, with traveling all around the US.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>My father's first post was in Downtown Brooklyn, and he had friends that he kept
                    his whole life that he met when he was a young cop, his fellow cops. Then he
                    became a plainclothesman, because he was very good-looking and also knew how to
                    handle himself. So he was in the Safe and [Burglary] Squad for a while and did
                    something in the Vice Squad, which my mother did not approve of. She didn't like
                    it at all that he would be even doing something, even though he said he never
                    did anything, and cops didn't. He did a little bit in the Vice Squad, but then
                    mostly he was on the Safe and [Burglary] Squad. So we'd hear stories about
                    safecrackers.</p>
                <p>Then he was assigned to the Pickpocket Squad, and he and my mother used to go
                    down when there were sailings of ships. Right at the foot of 58th Street in
                    Brooklyn was the German-America Line, the Rex and the Bremen, the two big
                    German-America liners. Whenever there was a sailing, my father would go down.
                    Talk about an interesting story of corruption in the New York City Police
                    Department - his first day in the pickpocket squad, some friend of his, was
                    going to help break him in. He took him to lunch at Lindy's Restaurant. My
                    father didn't know it at the time, but every pickpocket in New York City was
                    there, to get a look at the new guy in the pickpocket squad. My father heard
                    that the fellow who took him there had gotten $500 for that. The pickpockets
                    knew who my father was. And he looked like a cop anyway. He would get on the
                    Europa or Bremen, they were two German ships, and he and my mother would walk
                    around for an hour or so before sailing time, till they told everybody to get
                    off. The pickpockets would scramble away because my father would be watching.
                    He'd go up and say, “Get the hell out of here. You don't belong here. You're not
                    on this ship. Get out of here.” They would go, or they would just see him; they
                    wouldn't even let him come up to them; they would just leave. Then, I don't know
                    what happened, but he got into some kind of trouble, and in the movies, they
                    used to say, “I'll have you transferred to Canarsie.” Remember that? Old scenes
                    in the early movie days the guy says to the cop, “Who do you think you are? I'll
                    have you transferred to Canarsie.” Well, my father was transferred to
                    Canarsie.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Canarsie being -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Canarsie is two hours away from where we lived by the subway. It took him
                    two hours to get there and two hours to get back. He didn't like it, because he
                    didn't like his partner, who was not Irish. My father was there for about two
                    years. My mother talked to a friend of ours who worked in police headquarters,
                    and she went and talked to his wife and said, “You've got to get John out of
                    Canarsie. He's been there now . . . it's too much for him.” Anyway, he was
                    transferred to Claussen Avenue. Then my father was transferred to Brooklyn
                    Police Headquarters and then from there to the next precinct over, which was the
                    precinct where he grew up. The 72nd Squad was on 60th Street and Fifth Avenue in
                    Brooklyn. It's somewhere else now. That's where he spent his last about 12 years
                    or so in the police department before he retired.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about as a kid growing up there in the early '30's
                        and all. Obviously the Depression was on. Did kids run in what were then
                        considered gangs? Today gangs are quite a different matter. In those days, I
                        mean, a bunch of kids getting together.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Not really gangs. I wouldn't say they were gangs. We had friends, we
                    naturally had friends. No, I would not say that. In my earliest memories, I
                    remember, though, being out on the street in a baby carriage. I remember hearing
                    talk about “Lucky Lindy” Lindbergh. That's one of my earliest memories of
                    hearing about somebody; it was about Lindbergh and the Lindbergh kidnapping. And
                    I remember the night that Hauptmann was executed, everybody expected all the
                    lights to dim. Of course, they didn't. But anyway, that was sort of the
                    idea.</p>
                <p>But they weren't a gang. But I had friends, and we were different because my
                    mother insisted that we go away in the summertime, so at some sacrifice we went
                    to the Catskills. It was a place that had an outdoor [pool] and all that. We
                    used to go swimming in a quarry in a place called Morgan Hill, near a place
                    called West Hurley, which is not far from Woodstock, an artists' colony even
                    then, and a nice place. So we used to go there for two months in the summer, and
                    I learned to swim. And then also in the '30's, in Sunset Park, which is the
                    nearest big park, they put in a swimming pool. But most of my friends didn't
                    know how to swim. Those that did learned in Sunset Park. That was built by Mayor
                    LaGuardia.</p>
                <p>I went to parochial school, Our Lady of Perpetual Health School on 59th Street
                    and Sixth Avenue in Brooklyn, which was a very good school. A Cardinal by the
                    name of Ratzinger wrote a book and one of the chapters is “A Church without
                    Nuns.” He writes about the drop-off in the numbers of nuns, but in those days
                    there were thousands of nuns. There were, I think, 3,000 nuns in the Diocese of
                    Brooklyn, and every teacher in our school, every teacher, was a nun, right
                    through. They had two grades for each year for boys and two grades for each year
                    for girls, over 2,000 kids in the school and we had over 60 kids in my class.
                    But I'm telling you, we were ahead of the public schools. We did better. And the
                    New York City public schools in those days were good. Certain ones were better
                    than others, but in general those schools were all good, and our schools were
                    better, as shown by the Regents' exams, because we took the New York State
                    Regents' Exam -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is very strict.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: - at the end of the year, yes. And when you graduated, you got a Regents'
                    Diploma or you didn't. If you didn't, you would get a school diploma, like my
                    sisters got. If you couldn't pass all the Regents' Exams, they still graduated
                    you, and you could get out of high school, but you did not get a Regents'
                    Diploma.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Now in my neighborhood, they were Irish, I would guess by 60 per cent. And I
                    would guess 30 per cent were Norwegian, so it was very markedly Irish and
                    Norwegian, and there was a Norwegian church nearby, which now, I think, is
                    Korean. And then 10 per cent were mixed, a couple of Italians and mostly Poles,
                    Croats, and other Slavs. That was the ethnic composition of the neighborhood,
                    and the two groups were pretty much separate. The Irish oriented to the Catholic
                    Church and Catholic schools and the Norwegians went to public school and to the
                    Lutheran Church. They also had their national customs. I know about Sjutte Maj,
                    May 7th, a Norwegian holiday. There were also a few Swedes in the neighborhood,
                    and they were there because they worked on the docks and the boats. They were
                    seamen.</p>
                <p>In general, we were fairly separate. My father's closest friend in the police
                    department, I mentioned, was a Norwegian himself, and I know that one of the
                    crises in my family came when he asked - he had about seven children, and I
                    guess he was running out of godparents for his kids - and he asked my father to
                    be the godfather. Well, my father thought he was not supposed to do that, but he
                    just couldn't say no to a friend, so he did it. And that worried him for a
                    while, but he got it straightened out after a while.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the neighborhood has changed over the years, very slowly, to Puerto Rican
                    - a lot of Puerto Ricans, but still the Irish dominated - and then it was
                    changed more markedly in recent years. As the Norwegians and Swedes have moved
                    out, it has become Chinese. So down on the street where I lived, where I go back
                    all the time - my sister still lives in the house - my end of the street is
                    mostly Hispanic, and the Puerto Ricans have been replaced a lot by Dominican
                    Republic people. But as you go down the street towards Eighth Avenue from Sixth
                    Avenue, you get more and more Chinese, and Eighth Avenue - it's like Hong Kong.
                    It's absolutely, totally Chinese. It's the third largest Chinatown in New York
                    City. Chinatown, you know, has expanded in Manhattan so it has crowded out
                    Little Italy. Little Italy is now “Tiny Italy.” A couple of famous Italian
                    restaurants are still there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find it? Were the nuns rather strict?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes, when you think about it. Those nuns - again, it was a remarkable
                    age, as I look back and think about it, because I'm interested in history too; I
                    majored in history in college - anyway, those nuns were graduated from high
                    school, and a lot of them were smart. They graduated some of them at the age of
                    17. They would go for one year called a novitiate, and at the end of one year
                    they would be - not ordained, I forget what they call it - professed, I think
                    they call it, as nuns. And then they'd be thrown into a classroom with 60 kids.
                    How do you keep discipline in a class like that? Well, they used physical means,
                    but not only that. They had presence. You know, when that nun walked into the
                    room, everybody stopped. We would go to school in the morning, we'd go into a
                    schoolyard and play, running around, and then the nuns would come over from the
                    convent, and ring a bell. You know how kids make a big thing of whatever they
                    were doing. We had to stop right there. So a kid would be running, and he'd stop
                    like that, you know, and freeze. And then ring the bell again, you had to run to
                    your place. Everybody lined up. Then we saluted the flag. It was very patriotic,
                    I'll tell you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: There was nothing lacking in patriotism because it was a Catholic school.
                    That's why I could never understand when Dr. Conant said that Catholic schools
                    were divisive. I think I know what he was talking about, but anyway, they were
                    not divisive in that sense. They were very patriotic. We were the most patriotic
                    people. We had some right-wing ideas, but we were very patriotic, no doubt about
                    that. The US was the best, no matter what country you came from.</p>
                <p>Anyway, everybody would go to class then, and I remember you got into your seat
                    and knelt down, sort of facing the back, and there would be a holy picture or
                    something, and we'd say a very short prayer - Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory Be -
                    and then turn around, sit down, and the day's lesson would start. It was very
                    interesting, really, when you think about it.</p>
                <p>Now, as I say, the presence of the teachers was enough, but for example, if you
                    came late to school, you couldn't get into school. Sister Elise was the
                    principal, and she would come out with a ruler. You'd have to wait in this
                    vestibule of the school. A bunch of kids, maybe 10 kids, would be lined up. And
                    you had to put out your hand, and she had a ruler, and she'd go L-A-T-E, and
                    then you'd go ahead, L-A-T-E. So you got four raps on your hand stretched out
                    like that. It wasn't much, but people didn't like it. I mean, you didn't want
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>Then if somebody was really bad, they would slap the kids. And some of the older
                    nuns would slap a little more; some of the younger ones wouldn't, because these
                    nuns, as I say, were 18 or 19 years old, and they would come to that school and
                    then two days a week and Saturdays they would got to St. John's University and
                    study education. It would take them maybe 8 years - they'd still be pretty young
                    - and they'd be getting a bachelor's degree. The smarter ones might go on and
                    get a master's degree and teach in the Catholic high schools. So that they were
                    qualified teachers, they were on their way to being qualified. And you know
                    yourself, when you're a student, you're better sometimes than when you're fully
                    trained. Later on, you might forget.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, absolutely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Those teachers were very good, and they wanted us to do well in the
                    Regents. Now I think somebody criticizing the system might say, well, yes, and
                    this was true: we would get the old Regents' Exams and go over them and over
                    them and over them. Well, that's what kids do now getting ready for the SAT's
                    [Student Aptitude Tests].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I went through the old Regents. I was up in Connecticut,
                        and we used the old Regents' Exam, oh, absolutely. It was a good exam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Oh, it was a good exam, and if you knew the answer, you also knew a lot
                    already. But I think people might say you were learning by rote, you weren't
                    learning to think for yourself. That was a criticism, I think, that would come
                    out of, say, Columbia Teachers College, that you were learning by rote. But in a
                    way there's nothing wrong with that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were at elementary school, do you remember
                        anything about reading? Did you read much, or did you find yourself
                        constrained, or maybe not interested in reading?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Oh, no, we read all the time. We had a reading book, and we started in
                    just like in any other school I can't remember which textbooks we had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was thinking more about recreational reading.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>MARTIN: Oh, well, I was a reader. Once I learned to read, I was a voracious
                    reader. I had a friend named Billy O'Connell, and his family had an
                    encyclopedia. That's another thing about an Irish neighborhood like that. I
                    could walk down - there were four or five houses on that block - I did not have
                    to knock on the door; I'd just walk in. The O'Connells' house was right around
                    the corner. I'm still friends with Marie O'Connell, who lives in that house.
                    They had an encyclopedia. I used to go in that house and read that encyclopedia
                    from cover to cover.</p>
                <p>The greatest honor you could have in that school, as growing up, a real prestige
                    thing, was to become an altar boy. You had to be in the fourth grade, then they
                    took you in in the fifth grade. And in the fourth grade you had to learn Latin -
                    it took you about six months. You had to memorize the Latin responses to the
                    priest's prayers at mass. I did that. The altar boys had something called the
                    altar boys' library, which was just for their use. They wanted those guys to
                    become priests. My class was one of the worst classes ever. Very few people went
                    that way. We had about three guys go that way. But some classes had as many as
                    10 priests.</p>
                <p>That church, Our Lady of Perpetual Health Church in Brooklyn, was elevated to the
                    rank of basilica. First, it's a great big church. All the bishops in Brooklyn,
                    when they become bishops, are consecrated in that church, even though it's not
                    the cathedral. (The cathedral is St. James's.) And it's run by a group of
                    priests called the Redemptorist Fathers, founded by St. Alphonsus Liguori, an
                    Italian lawyer. They're famous as moral theologians. To become an altar boy in
                    that church was something, and they treated us like we were the elite of the
                    class. It was great because there were a lot of funerals. There might be two or
                    three funerals a week, so I would be serving at a funeral mass maybe every other
                    week. And that was great because you could get out in the middle of class, serve
                    mass, and come back to class. So that was prestige, to stand up in a class,
                    “Sister, I have to go. . . .” you know, serve a funeral. And you'd go up; she'd
                    say okay'; you got kind of a blessing and went and came back. So anyway, to be
                    an altar boy was something elite, and the altar boys' library had a complete set
                    of Tom Swift. Tom Swift and his Magic Motorcycle, Tom Swift and his Automobile,
                    Tom Swift and his First Aeroplane. So it went on and on and on. Dick Prescott's
                    First Year at West Point, Dick Prescott's Second . . . . third and fourth year,
                    Dick Prescott, Second Lieutenant, Dick Prescott, First Lieutenant - I read all
                    those books. And they had the same thing for Annapolis. They had other boys'
                    books, some Dickens books there; there was a complete set. These were not
                    religious books. I said altar boys' library - no, it was a boys' library that
                    kids would like. In addition to that in Brooklyn they had the public library at
                    51st Street and Fourth Avenue. Now I didn't join that until I went to high
                    school, but in high school on my way home, I went by the public library. I
                    always went into the public library, and as I say, I was a voracious reader. I
                    read everything in sight. I'm still a reader. I've got the book reviews right
                    here. I read the, New York Times and Washington Post and the Washington Times
                    Book Review all the time. So, did I read? I was a reader.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what about high school? Where did you go to high
                        school?</hi>

                <p>MARTIN: As I say, they wanted us to become priests. They were encouraging that,
                    but they couldn't say, “You should be a priest”; that's not allowed, by Canon
                    Law. You had to have the vocation, the calling. They would talk a lot about the
                    calling, and you knew they were talking about you, but none of us guys were. I
                    got interested in girls when I was in about the sixth grade. I knew I was not
                    going to be a priest. So anyway, people took exams. Those going away to be
                    priests would go away. They would go up to a place near Erie, Pennsylvania,
                    called Northeast College, and it was a junior seminary. Then there was an exam
                    that was given to everybody in the Diocese of Brooklyn. Every Catholic kid could
                    take it, public school or Catholic school. To take this exam, on a certain day
                    you went to the school, you took the exam, and then they'd pick, by quota, six
                    from our parish (because it was a very big parish), then two from some, three
                    from others, and so forth. It was St. Michael's Diocesan High School.</p>
                <p>And St. Michael's Diocesan High School, really a great school, although it had
                    probably the worst facilities that you could imagine, because it was founded in
                    1928, and the monsignor, I guess he went there. They wanted to do something
                    good. I mean, brothers agreed to teach there on the understanding that a real
                    high school would be built. And then came the Depression. There was no money
                    around and no possibility to do that. So we had awful facilities, but we had a
                    wonderful school. And we had these Xaverian Brothers and some lay teachers in
                    the school, and everybody had to have two years of Latin (I had three). I had
                    four years of science, four years of math, four years of English, and I think
                    two years of history, plus we had religion that was also a subject. And I'm
                    telling you, it was a wonderful school. I got there in 1940 and graduated in
                    1944.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume, on the social life, that one dated only Catholic
                        girls.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: No, nobody dated anybody at all at that age. In the first place, we were
                    aware of girls, and people say, well, you know, in seventh or eighth grade,
                    people say, “You like Mary” - “No, I don't. That's wrong!” You know, it starts
                    out that way. Then in the first year of high school, Friday nights they had
                    religious teaching for the public school kids. We used to go just to sit there,
                    but afterwards they had a dance, and we danced, and I'll tell you, we are the
                    greatest dancers, the people from Brooklyn. My father was a great dancer. My
                    uncle I mentioned. And I was a good dancer. And we went dancing. But you didn't
                    “date.” No, I didn't date at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was the era of the great bands, and dancing was, of
                        course, very much part of it -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: - both swing and jitterbugging -</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>MARTIN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: - but I mean the whole -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: The whole thing. There were six of us. Two are now dead, but there were
                    six of us, and two of us went to St. Michael's. The other school we used to go
                    to was called Brooklyn Tech. Brooklyn Tech was for somebody who wanted to be an
                    engineer or something scientific.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's well known.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: It's a wonderful school. So two of the guys went to Brooklyn Tech. One
                    guy went to a school called St. Francis. He didn't get into St. Michael's. And
                    the other guy eventually finished high school, but he didn't do very well. He
                    went to public high school, but he was the kind of guy who used to run away from
                    home every once in a while. But I liked him. He used to read a lot. He was a
                    smart guy. Anyway, he was in our group too. So there were six of us.</p>
                <p>And then there were girls. On 61st Street there was a gang of girls, and you
                    might say we “related” to them, but we didn't date. Nobody dated anyway. The
                    biggest thing, maybe the first date I ever had, was finding somebody to go to my
                    high school prom. Nowadays, they have a baby in the high school prom, you know.
                    But anyway, that was the biggest thing. I took a girl. I never took her out
                    before or after. We had a good time. I remember her name: Theresa Smith.</p>
                <p>That was another thing, the names that people had: Theresa. That was a big name
                    then. Bernadette. You know, you don't meet many Theresas or Bernadettes now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have a daughter-in-law named Theresa, but she's one of
                        the few.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: I mean there's a lot of them. But you know, naming is much different
                    today than it was before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, going back to reading and to interests, you say
                        you've always been interested in history. How did you pick history?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>MARTIN: Well, we had very good history teaching, I think. In grammar school you
                    learned about men, great men, and in each class we had a class president, not
                    like class presidents today, where the guy is the president of the class - none
                    of that - but we had a favorite president, you had to know something about
                    Abraham Lincoln or George Washington, and the final exam always had questions on
                    that. We had a class poem. You had to memorize eight lines of a poem. We had a
                    class poem and we had a class saint. You might learn about St. Patrick: what did
                    he do? You had to know a short biography of a saint. We had one in each class,
                    so by the time you finished, you knew a lot of different saints, you knew a lot
                    about presidents, a lot of stories. And then they also studied about war. You
                    studied mainly the war itself and this battle and that battle. I remember even
                    in grammar school, we learned that the Battle of New Orleans took place after
                    the war was over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The War of 1812, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes, people didn't get the word. So anyway, I would say history was about
                    heroes. And my mother had insurance, life insurance on my father. And I remember
                    the guy would come around and collect like a dollar twenty every month. And he
                    used to hand out blue pamphlets which had the life of some hero. I remember
                    reading about Fremont.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John Fremont.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: John Fremont - all about him and California, the Great Bear flag that
                    they had, and that kind of thing. So I would say that the history teaching we
                    got was American history - and as I say, we were very patriotic. I wrote an
                    essay - I guess I wrote it in eighth grade - called “The Importance of Cultural
                    and Commercial Relations between the Americas.” It was New York State-wide essay
                    contest, and I got a fourth prize.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, that's very good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: I was already in high school by then, the first year of high school. I
                    remember the principal of the school said I should go over to the awards
                    ceremony, which was in City Hall. It was very nice. Anyway, so I knew enough
                    from my general reading and also from my history teaching that I was able to
                    write an essay in a city-wide contest that got a prize.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, you were in high school from 1940 to '44.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously there was a certain event taking place at that
                        time. Can you talk about how World War II affected your interests and what
                        you all were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Okay. By the time I left grammar school, everybody was interested in what
                    was happening in Europe, and of course we always got everything from a Catholic
                    point of view. And I remember when I was a kid, we thought Franco was great.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. I was just going to ask about Franco.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Franco was one of our heroes. And part of it was because - and I remember
                    this caused a little bit of trouble in my mind - because the Loyalists were on
                    one side and Franco was on the other. Now the word loyal was a good word to me,
                    so how could the Loyalists be on the wrong side? I didn't quite understand that,
                    but I also knew Franco was a good guy and then we were hearing these horrible
                    stories about what was happening to the Catholic Church in Spain. You know, they
                    killed - I didn't know that then - but I think they killed something like 11,000
                    priests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: They killed over 20,000 nuns. They had to start orphanages for nuns who
                    were raped and had babies, and all that kind of stuff. That was true. They were
                    true. So we were for Franco, and not Roosevelt at that time. You see, my family,
                    politically, were Al Smith Democrats. They loved Al Smith. So they were what my
                    mother used to say - and the word comes up again now, they try to use it, but
                    somehow it never catches on - but the word progressive. My mother and my family
                    were progressives. They thought of themselves as progressive people, so they
                    welcomed new ideas and thought the government should be doing something for
                    people. And of course, everybody favored the government, because the thing to do
                    then was to get a civil service job. They had newspapers that were just about
                    the civil service that would tell you when the next exam was. I remember my
                    father and my mother talking about somebody in the neighborhood; he passed the
                    letter carriers' exam, or he passed the cops' exam, or he didn't pass the cops'
                    exam. And the promotion exams. People were studying to get promoted all the
                    time. It was one of my father's disappointments that he never really did get
                    promoted in the Police Department, and it was because he had an eighth grade
                    education. He never really was able to go beyond that. He could have become a
                    priest if he had wanted to. The pastor of his church in Brooklyn even told his
                    mother that, “if he wants to be a priest, we'll see to it that the money is
                    taken care of for the tuition and the seminary.” But anyway, he thought he
                    should work to support his mother.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about World War II? In the first place, your
                        family were Al Smith Democrats. Did this cause a problem with
                        Roosevelt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because there was at first, at one point, the relationship
                        was great, and then there was a real divergence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: The thing was, people believed - maybe it was true - that Al Smith had
                    been stabbed in the back by Roosevelt, and therefore we didn't like Roosevelt
                    for that, even though people really did favor his policies. Certainly Social
                    Security was something that later on became very important to my family. At that
                    time it was just being passed. I don't think my father was eligible at that
                    time, because he was a policeman. But I'm not sure of that. Anyway Roosevelt
                    tried to pack the Supreme Court; I remember that very well. I remember my father
                    being very upset about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1938 or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: It was earlier than that, I think. Maybe '37, '36 or so. And I heard
                    later the justification was “the nine old men.” I remember the picture in the
                    paper, and the nine old men were just too old to be on the Supreme Court. Five
                    or six of them were over 70. At that time, that was really ancient. I heard
                    later that the justification for replacing those guys was that they couldn't
                    handle their workload. It turned out when it was investigated, their workload
                    was current. Of course, the workload of the Supreme Court in those days was so
                    light. I heard in law school that people had been known to resign from the
                    Senate to become a Federal court judge because it was not quite a sinecure but
                    it was a lifetime job, good pay, and not a heavy workload.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Although my family was never rabidly anti-British, we were kind of. The English,
                    you know, “The English will fight to the last American,” or something like that,
                    I did hear that. But, I never heard a word against Queen Victoria, and a lot of
                    my reading was from British books, and I read a lot of war stories about British
                    regiments like the Prince's Patch, the Canadian, and The Black Watch. I remember
                    a book called Fifty Famous Stories with all the classical stories in about five
                    or six pages. It was given to me by my cousin Elizabeth, who was my father's
                    favorite cousin. She lived out in Greenport, Long Island. We used to go to see
                    her, and something happened in her family, and they got divorced. It was a big
                    shock, a big shock. Well, her husband was Protestant; somehow it could happen,
                    and she was, too, because earlier on somebody died and the children had to be
                    sent to their Protestant cousins. They raised them as Protestants, and so Cousin
                    Elizabeth was Episcopal. She came and stayed with us while she was looking for a
                    job, which she found quite quickly. But she was grateful, and my family
                    naturally wouldn't take anything from her, but she felt an obligation to us, and
                    she came with books. I got books from the National Geographic Society. I
                    remember I got The Book of Fishes, The Book of Animals of North America - I got
                    all those. We had books in the house, too - not many, but some, and good books,
                    which I could read. And Fifty Famous Stories, I read that book a hundred times:
                    Thermopylae, you know, how roast pig was discovered - I remember in one of the
                    books.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My wife and I were talking about that just yesterday,
                        about Dissertation on Roast Pig, by Charles Lamb.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes. I loved those stories. A lot of them were World War I stories, and
                    my Uncle George had fought in World War I. That was interesting because in New
                    York City he had tried to join the Marines. They wouldn't take him because he
                    was too light. When they started drafting people, he went down, and they took
                    him. He was in the 77th Division, which was the Statue of Liberty Division.
                    Later on he worked in the American Museum of Natural History on the West Side of
                    Manhattan. This got me kind of interested in the Foreign Service, though I
                    really didn't know anything about it, but it got me interested in exploring and
                    overseas and all. He was a painter. He had only an eighth grade education. He
                    got along as a painter, but then he got promoted. He was in charge of the
                    exhibits section that mounted exhibits for the explorers, when they would come
                    back. You've seen them, like a diorama. He'd be in charge of that. So he knew
                    Roy Chapman Andrews. You've seen this movie about Indiana Jones? Well I read
                    Indiana Jones is supposedly modeled after Roy Chapman Andrews -</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Right, and he also wrote a marvelous book, which I read, called Under a
                    Lucky Star, his autobiography. He tells some funny stories in there. He was in
                    Japan, where he studied whaling, whales. He was a mammalogist, or something, at
                    the beginning, and a general anthropologist. He's the guy that discovered
                    dinosaur eggs.</p>

                <p>MARTIN: Right, and he discovered the dinosaur eggs in the Gobi Desert. His book,
                    Under a Lucky Star, tells about living in Peking. One of our colleagues in DACOR
                    [Diplomatic and Consular Officers Retired] was Dick Butrick.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: He was in China and closed the embassy in Peking, and he knew Roy Chapman
                    Andrews. He said he was a spy. I'm sure that the OSS would call up a guy like
                    Roy Chapman Andrews and use his knowledge, because he was a brilliant guy and
                    had a wonderful life as an explorer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that was almost seminal for many people
                        of our generation and for the Foreign Service, really, was World War II and
                        the fact that we really learned about geography and the world beyond. How
                        about that? I mean, were you reading the papers and hearing about
                        Guadalcanal and Guam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: I remember I was reading the New York Times - we used to get the Sunday
                    Times - and we were reading the New York Times on Sunday, December 7, 1941, when
                    the word came over radio that Pearl Harbor had been attacked. Before the war we
                    were talking about events in Europe. I remember hearing the French army is so
                    great, and it turned out they weren't so great; the German army was greater. We
                    were interested in all those things, and then I was in the first year of high
                    school when Pearl Harbor happened. We said the war will be over in no time;
                    we'll beat these Japanese. We were mainly focused on the Japanese at that time,
                    at the very beginning; and then later on people realized it was going to be a
                    long time. But I was too young to join up, although as a kid I always had had an
                    interest in going to Annapolis. In high school, my eyes were such there'd be no
                    chance of my going to Annapolis, so I didn't think much about that after a
                    while. In high school everybody knew he was going to go in the military. I had
                    guys in my class who graduated with me and who went in immediately, and one of
                    them was wounded in the Battle of the Bulge, a guy in my high school class. He
                    was hit, and he didn't like to say where he was hit. I think he was shot in the
                    backside. He said, “I was hit outside Li�ge.”</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Everybody was thinking about going into the military. My uncle George was in
                    World War I. It was in my family. He was on the Draft Board in the neighborhood.
                    It was unthinkable that I would not go into the military, but I also was
                    thinking about my education, so the navy had a program my eyes weren't good
                    enough to get into. They had the best program. The V-12 and the V-5 programs
                    were to be an officer, and you got at least two years of college at a good
                    school before it could happen. That was the V-12 and the V-5 program. V-5 was to
                    be a naval aviator. But the army had something called the Army Specialized
                    Training Program [ASTP], and so I applied for that, and was accepted. I was
                    assigned to Rutgers. I was also taking other scholarship exams, and I won a
                    scholarship, a four-year full scholarship to St. John's University. Actually, I
                    came in third or something, so I won a half scholarship. But the brother in
                    charge of the school said, “If you'll go now, they'll give you a full four-year
                    scholarship.” Because they were desperate for students. They were down to about
                    112 students in the whole college, guys who were IV-f [exempted as physically
                    unfit] or had been discharged for one reason or another. The brother said, “You
                    can resign.” I said, “Resign? You can't resign from the army.” He said, “That's
                    right. You're not resigning from the army, but you can resign from the Army
                    Specialized Training Program.” Well, I really had my orders to go to Rutgers, so
                    you would have been talking to a Rutgers graduate if I had not taken the
                    brother's advice. I'm glad I did, because the big thing I did in high school was
                    to be on the track team, and then at St. John's I also ran on the track team. My
                    main interest in college, I would say, was track. I loved track. I was captain
                    of the cross-country team and then also on the track team. So I was looking
                    forward to it. I went immediately to college upon graduation in June.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1944.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: A couple of days later, 1944, I started at St. John's, and they have a
                    one-year course in the summer on chemistry. I had had chemistry in high school.
                    We had a great teacher of chemistry, so it was a walkover for me. I took one of
                    these general exams - like an SAT - and I came out in the 97th percentile in
                    chemistry at the end of this seven - week course. I was really good. I wanted to
                    be a doctor at that time. I was taking pre-med. Then in the fall I took analytic
                    chemistry, and I didn't do so well. It was a different professor. I also took
                    college algebra and a course in American history, I think up to the Civil War. I
                    forget what else I took; I took entry level courses. The first-year English
                    course you have to take. And then in December 1944, I turned 18. The New York
                    Times reported at that time - I remember reading it - that they were going to
                    draft one million men, the last big push. They anticipated victory and the
                    million men were going to do it. It was going to be over in Europe, and they
                    needed them for Japan. I went into the army on Valentine's day, 1945, and
                    reported to Fort Dix. On the same orders with me were these guys who had been at
                    Rutgers. I'm talking with them, and they said ASTP. So anyway, I had a year's
                    credit in college, and I went back there later. That's when I got my degree.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>We were at Fort Dix about 10 days. I remember I wrote something about it in my
                    memoir. I remember that basic training very well. We were there about 10 days,
                    and then we got on a train and went down to Camp Croft, South Carolina. They
                    said they were going to train us to be heavy weapons infantrymen, which meant 18
                    millimeter mortars and .50 caliber machine guns. About two weeks later, they
                    said, no, we're shifting you over to riflemen, and that was for cannon fodder.
                    That's what they needed. At that time, the ships were built, the planes were
                    there, the big battles had been established, and all the training had taken
                    place. The pilots, the infrastructure for the invasion of Japan, was there. All
                    they needed was more cannon fodder. I don't want to say that, but that's the way
                    it worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There really was a manpower shortage towards the end. We
                        had something like 88 divisions, large divisions, and they were all
                        hurting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes. I went through basic training at Camp Croft, South Carolina, which I
                    remember very well, and it was great. The people in our group were mostly
                    18-year-olds, but a couple of guys 19 somehow snuck in. Then we had some between
                    the ages of 39 and 42 who had been deferred for one reason or another. We had a
                    group that were illiterate and who had gotten literacy training that the army
                    gave. They gave five months of training and brought people up to the fourth
                    grade level. They considered that to be enough to be in the army. I remember
                    helping some of them because a lot of them lived nearby. They were from the
                    hills of North Carolina, and I helped some of them write letters home. Some of
                    those guys couldn't find their way home on a weekend. I was going all over the
                    place, and my first girlfriend I had when I was in the army was in a place
                    called Shelby, North Carolina. It is a wonderful little town, a real southern
                    town with the Confederate soldier in front of the courthouse in the main
                    square.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Facing south - facing north, I mean.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Is that right? Well, anyway, okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Usually Union soldiers face south, Confederate soldiers
                        face north.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>MARTIN: Aha. Okay. That's great. I remember that little town, and that girlfriend
                    I had. I used to meet her at an American Legion Hall dance. When I got a weekend
                    pass, I would go up there. At the end we went to Fort Meade because the Army had
                    tracks, and the track from Camp Croft ran to Europe. While I was in basic
                    training, President Roosevelt died, and V-E Day took place, and both times the
                    training stopped. Instead we trained for parade, and we had a memorial parade
                    for each event, in honor of Roosevelt and in honor of V-E Day. Then our training
                    was extended a little bit, and we did more problems and so forth. I remember
                    marching with a 60-pound pack, 22 miles. Because it was hot, we marched at
                    night. We knew we couldn't march in the daytime or people would have been
                    dropping like flies. We trained on every weapon the army infantrymen could
                    possibly have, and then we went to Fort Meade. That was my first visit to
                    Washington one weekend; my first visit to Baltimore another weekend.</p>
                <p>From there, I went on a train, and I remember being struck by the waste in the
                    army. At Fort Dix, they'd given me an overcoat that was just like the one my
                    Uncle George had in World War I. At the end of 10 days I had to leave that
                    overcoat. I didn't mind that so much, but I had a pair of shoes in basic
                    training, and as far as I was concerned, I could still wear those shoes. I
                    couldn't understand that they made me throw away these shoes and they gave me a
                    new pair of shoes, combat boots. We went by train across the United States to
                    Camp Stoneman, California. We stayed in Camp Stoneman, again, about 10 days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the shipping-off point for Japan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: For the Pacific. Not Japan, for the Pacific.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was there in 1952 being sent off to Korea, in '51. It's
                        still being used for that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes, so Camp Stoneman, and Stoneman was the name of a General in the
                    Civil War. I think he was a Union General.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, a cavalry general.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>MARTIN: Anyway, Camp Stoneman. I went to San Francisco, my first visit. That was
                    my first visit to the West Coast. Then we got on a boat. It was like an
                    excursion boat or a ferry boat, converted. It was called the Ernie Pyle, and we
                    sailed down the Sacramento River to San Francisco, and got off and walked
                    across. The day, when we got on the ship, first of all, I remember still
                    something very vividly, the way the army worked. In the first place, on the dock
                    they had these “gray ladies,” Red Cross ladies, giving us coffee and doughnuts.
                    Then when we went on the ship, they would call. You know the way the army does
                    it. They'd say “Martin” and I'd say, “Stephen D.” - and then go up, and they
                    would check me off that I was accounted for. They had a big sign that said THE
                    ARMY GROUND FORCES TRAINED YOU. THE ARMY TRANSPORTATION CORPS GOT YOU HERE. Then
                    they had a sign, NOW IT'S UP TO YOU. Effective. It made an impression. I can
                    still remember.</p>
                <p>You know, because you're going overseas as infantry, you don't know what the
                    hell's going to happen. We also had a seasickness pill, but I didn't get
                    seasick. We got on, and they grabbed us for guard duty. It was a merchant chip,
                    the Media, and it sailed, and the newspapers on the dock - there were daily
                    newspapers there, and it told about the atomic bomb, and the big discussion was,
                    is this just a bigger bomb, or is it some kind of a new-type bomb? We were
                    saying, “Well, you know, who knows?” The ship sailed, so it must have been
                    August 5 or something like that, and they said we were going to go north of
                    Hawaii. I couldn't understand why. But anyway, we went on a great circle route.
                    We went to Ulithi [Caroline Islands] and Eniwetok, or maybe Eniwetok then
                    Ulithi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are in the Marianas, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes, and this was the route, and they were very big Navy bases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>MARTIN: We used Eniwetok later for atomic bomb tests. At that time there were
                    ships there. We did not get off the ship, but the ship pulled in there. I guess
                    we got more provisions and then sailed on. We were headed for the Philippines.
                    We went to Leyte. At Leyte, we were almost immediately put in this replacement
                    camp and then were assigned to divisions. My best friend in the army, whom I was
                    friends with later, Ed Delaney, went to New Guinea. But I was assigned to the
                    81st Division. It's called the 81st Wildcat Division, and I went to a reunion
                    with them recently. The 77th Division was also in the 9th Corps, or in the same
                    corps, and I was thinking, maybe I should volunteer to get in the 77th Division
                    because that's where my Uncle George was in World War I. I was in the 81st
                    Division, Company L, 322nd Infantry, and they made me, the last guy in, you can
                    imagine, an 18-year-old private (at least the others were private first class),
                    an ammunition bearer in a mortar squad. That was my assignment as a private.
                    Anyway, we stayed there three weeks, and we had training every day, but it was
                    mostly just the kind of training you get in the army when you have nothing to
                    do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, by this time the war was over, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: The war was over. I landed in the Philippine Islands on V-J Day, and we
                    were getting ready to go to the Army of Occupation in Japan. I think it was the
                    Sixth Army and the Eighth Army that went, and then the Sixth Army was
                    deactivated, and the Eighth Army had headquarters in Yokohama, and they had a
                    corps headquarters later on in Sendai. I was in this infantry unit, and we did a
                    combat landing in Japan. They didn't want to use up the box that the ammunition
                    came in. I had to carry the shells in the box, even though I also had over my
                    pack this thing where you could put three shells in the front and six in the
                    back. In wartime you could throw away the box. But they didn't want to do that,
                    so my first day in Japan we made a combat landing. It was really thrilling to
                    see it, it was so well done. We got off the ship and climbed down the net. They
                    let down the box of shells, and actually the rope broke, and it crashed down. I
                    climbed down the net, got into the boat, and the boat pulled away, another one
                    came up, and they did a circle. Then somebody did a signal, and they go out in a
                    line, and they're lined up going into the shore. There was some poor guy - this
                    was Aomori, Japan, the northernmost city of Honshu - some poor Japanese guy
                    standing on the end of the dock with a little thing that said “Interpreter.” One
                    of the officers - we couldn't see what transpired, but anyway it must have been,
                    dismissed the guy. He decided he didn't speak English well enough, so they took
                    off the interpreter sign and sent him away. I suppose the guy went and committed
                    Hara Kiri or something. We did have Japanese interpreters with us, you know,
                    Japanese-Americans, Nisei.</p>
                <p>We got on a train and went to a place called Hirosaki, which was a town which had
                    not been bombed, beautiful with a wonderful castle up on the hill, from the 14th
                    century. It was apple country. I remember going to a dance with Japanese girls,
                    and they served apple wine, and some of us got a little tipsy on the apple wine.
                    That was apple country, cold, and the snow was this high in winter.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're showing about three and a half feet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes, it was in the snow country, the snow country of northern Japan. I
                    think it's a ski resort now. The mountain nearby that you could see we used to
                    call “Little Fuji.” That was our name for it, but it was named Iwakiyama. I used
                    to be on guard duty, just like I had been on guard duty on the ship. I really
                    loved to get up in the morning, four o'clock, from four o'clock until eight to
                    be on the ship. It's pitch dark when you go up on deck. You're sailing along.
                    You're seeing other ships lights sometimes. Gradually dawn comes. It's nice.</p>
                <p>In Japan, we used to get a daily newspaper, and I saw a notice one day. It was
                    just two pages, one sheet, two pages, with world news on one side. The other
                    side was division news; the 81st Infantry Wildcat was the paper. It said if you
                    would like to work on the Wildcat, send in your qualifications. I said, Yes,
                    I'll do it. That sounds good. I sent it in. People were surprised. The company
                    commander endorsed it, and then a couple of days later somebody said, “Battalion
                    headquarters, they sent your paper forward.” People couldn't quite believe it
                    when I got transferred to division headquarters. I was a big guy in the outfit,
                    and I went off in a truck. I worked on sports, and I would cover, I would go
                    around the division area, which is a very interesting place. Misawa was in our
                    division; the 321st was there, and later on the U-2 flew from there. This was
                    northern Honshu, very close to Siberia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually, Masao was later an air force base which was used
                        for monitoring with Soviet radio broadcasts out of Vladivostok. I know
                        because during the Korean War at one point I was up in Misawa, listening to
                        Vladivostok Soviet military.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: When I was in Misawa, it was nothing but mud. Maybe a Japanese army
                    battalion had been stationed there, but in our place in Hirosaki, when I first
                    got there, the biggest problem was the rats. I was assigned to the Rodent
                    Control Squad, and we got a lecture from the battalion surgeon on the life-cycle
                    of the rat, how you can spot them. If you are in a room and this far from the
                    floor on the wall there's a black line, that's a sign of rats. They run around a
                    room - they don't run across, generally - they run around the room, and the hair
                    from the rat comes off and marks a line. We used to have to search. We used to
                    have to put out rat poison.</p>
                <p>We did a poison count. I remember the battalion surgeon saying, “You have to put
                    out six little bits of poison at places where you think the rats might be” - and
                    we should know from the life-cycle of the rat - and then we should inspect them
                    the next day and see if any of them had been touched. He said, “About half of
                    them should have been touched.” He gave us a signal as to what should be in our
                    report. At least, that's how I understood him. I can't remember, but there were
                    no rats when we left. We did take care of the rats. This poison, whatever it
                    was, made the rat unbearably thirsty, and he would flee any building and go out
                    and look for water.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Anyway, I was accepted on the newspaper, and that is how I got promoted to
                    private first class. When I arrived, the lieutenant asked me how I would write a
                    story, and I explained, because I had been on my high school newspaper. We were
                    told how to write a lead, write a story, get people's names right, and at the
                    end, try to have a little wind-up, which is standard journalism even today. And
                    so I told that to him, and he said, “Okay, you're going to be writing sports.”
                    Later on, when some people were starting to leave (people were going home then),
                    they shifted me over to features, which I liked. And when the division broke up
                    - it broke up somewhere around December or January - half of the guys on the
                    outfit who could type (I couldn't type) went to Stars and Stripes. That was one
                    of my disappointments in life. The other half of us went to the Ninth Corps
                    Grenade. We were assigned to Ninth Corps headquarters. I was a feature writer on
                    the Ninth Corps Grenade, and I wrote - I still remember my story; it was a great
                    event for me - “The Anniversary of the Bombing of Sendai.” The B-29's were
                    bombing. They dropped leaflets on a whole lot of the cities in Japan, that said,
                    “We're going to bomb this city. Get out of town.” More or less. Everybody fled
                    the town, because they believed it. And then the Japanese Government announced
                    nobody could get his rice ration except at the rice station near his home. So
                    people came back.</p>
                <p>Then one night the bombers came, and of course they heard them coming, so they
                    had an air raid signal and everybody ran into the air raid shelters. The bombers
                    didn't bomb. They went over the city without bombing. People thought they were
                    headed someplace else, but then they turned around and they dropped their bombs
                    on the way out, not on the way in. You could see the shape of where the bombing
                    was. I could see it from a hill outside town where I went. A Japanese
                    newspaperman went over the whole thing with me. I wrote a story in our Ninth
                    Corps Grenade.</p>
                <p>I also got trips to Tokyo during that time. I remember going to see MacArthur.
                    You had to be six feet tall to be in MacArthur's honor guard. He used to come
                    out at a certain time every day, and people would stand to see him. At that
                    time, the Korean nationalists, who had been considered an enemy country, were
                    petitioning that they were friendly to the US that they had been occupied by. So
                    they were trying to give a petition to MacArthur. He knew, of course, they were
                    there, and they were yelling and all this, singing their national song, which is
                    similar to “Old Black Joe” or “My Old Kentucky Home” - whatever, it's an
                    American folk song. He came out and just as if they weren't there, got into his
                    car and drove off.</p>
                <p>I was there exactly a year. I arrived in Japan September 25th, and I left on
                    September 26th, '46.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about fraternization rules? Were there no
                        fraternization rules at that time? With the Japanese women, I was
                        wondering.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>MARTIN: No. On the typical day, we would go to the enlisted men's club at night,
                    and the Ninth Corps was only two divisions. It had the 1st Cavalry Division in
                    the south, and the 11th Airborne Division in the north. The jump school was
                    there in Sendai, and the people who flunked out of the jump school generally
                    came to corps headquarters. So we had a lot of guys who would tell stories about
                    jump school, and they'd made three or four jumps. I remember a friend named Four
                    Jumps Keepover as we called him, because he wouldn't make the last night's jump,
                    and he flunked out of jump school. But fraternization? Our social life was
                    mainly drinking beer in the enlisted men's club at night, but also people used
                    to go to the local whorehouse, and there was some black marketing going on,
                    selling cigarettes, but not much, really. People were pretty straight. But I
                    would say that the discipline was way down. People were sitting around
                    mostly.</p>
                <p>We did get one series of lectures by the corps commander, who was a famous
                    general in World War I. He had been relieved of command in the first big battle
                    in Kasserine Pass. His name was Charles W. Ryder, a great big lean guy. Somehow
                    he took the rap. I read something about him in a history book, that he was
                    considered to be the best tactician in the US army before World War II, but that
                    he tolerated poor subordinates. He was not strong enough to relieve a
                    subordinate, and he got relieved. I guess he spent most of the war then back in
                    the States, and then he went to the Philippines. He became a corps commander in
                    Japan in the occupation. He was a very impressive person. He ordered that we
                    have a series of lectures about what a corps command does. We had a lecture by
                    every member of the staff, G-1 to G-4, and then army signal corps, and engineer
                    corps. The heads came and gave a talk about what his job was, what he did. It
                    was very interesting for me to learn something about military science from these
                    lectures.</p>
                <p>For social life, because we were in a corps headquarters, and we did have a lot
                    of spare time, I remember going out on a Sunday afternoon. We had a jeep, and we
                    had a lot of food with us, sandwiches and such. We weren't going to eat it all,
                    so we left them by a Japanese house, and we knocked on the door for them to
                    come, and then we drove away. They came out and took the food. I also remember
                    when I first went to corps headquarters, we got our food in a mess kit. When we
                    came out, there were Japanese kids waiting for us. We always saved some of the
                    food. They would reach out and sweep their hands around and scoop out all the
                    food and eat it. They were hungry. Within a very short time, they would do the
                    same scoop out and take out the meat or whatever and throw it on the ground and
                    take just what they liked. It showed how people can adapt and change so
                    fast.</p>
                <p>I saw the suffering of the Japanese people there, and you couldn't help but like
                    them - or admire them. I'm not sure I would have said that at the time, but yes,
                    they were going through something. I like to read Japanese novels. They're
                    short, and they're very, very good, especially a writer named Endo. I really
                    like his stuff. He writes about that period as a heroic period, that the
                    Japanese today look back on that immediate postwar period with a great deal of
                    nostalgia. They feel that they were made to suffer, and they did.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>I stayed, and one year later I sailed for home. I arrived at Fort Lawton,
                    Washington, right in the city of Seattle. We stayed there for two nights, got on
                    the train, went across the northern United States, Milwaukee, St. Paul, south to
                    Chicago, across to Fort Dix, and into the chapel for a farewell ceremony. I
                    remember they asked me if I wanted to join the reserves. I didn't want to join
                    the reserves, at least not as a private first class infantry guy. Your army
                    experience was to train you for something outside. Since my MRS number was
                    rifleman, they gave me the job description that in civilian was comparable to a
                    rifleman, and it had this army jargon which said I could work on an assembly
                    line in a factory. That was what my army training had qualified me for.</p>
                <p>I intended to go back to college and did. I went back to St. John's. I was very
                    interested in the track team. We really got it started again, because there was
                    no coach. Our coach had died during the war, a guy named Jimmy Rosenberger. A
                    fellow named Bill Ward became the coach the next year. In between, we ran the
                    team ourselves. They gave us enough money so we could pay the entrance fee to
                    meets, and we still had the uniforms from before the war, and it was fun getting
                    the thing started again. I ran on the mile relay, and I also ran half mile. I
                    was captain of the cross-country team, so two letters, cross-country and
                    track.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your major?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: History. History and a minor in philosophy. I had started college as a
                    premed, but I had long since given up that idea, though I still didn't know what
                    I wanted to do. I was always a voracious reader. While I was in basic training
                    in the army, I got the idea for the Foreign Service, because there was a guy in
                    the next bunk from me, named McKinnock, and people said his father was a very
                    important person. His father was consul general in Toronto. He told me about
                    efficiency reports and working for a political appointee, and how his father was
                    upset. I guess he hadn't gotten a good efficiency report when he was down
                    somewhere in Latin America. But I was intrigued then, because I had read, My Ten
                    Years in Japan, by Joseph C. Grew. I saw what it was to be a diplomat, but what
                    I didn't know was that an ambassador is backed up by a lot of other people. I
                    had no idea of that. I'd never been overseas myself, and never visited an
                    embassy. But I could see from what McKinnock told me that you could join the
                    Foreign Service, and there's a lot to do, and you might become an ambassador or
                    you might not. His father didn't. They asked me how I came into the Foreign
                    Service when I took the Foreign Service Exam. I told that story, and the man on
                    the board - it was the Director General; his name was Jerry Drew - remembered
                    McKinnock. That was my first interest in the Foreign Servicit came from the

                <p>I first took the Foreign Service Exam in 1948 and missed it by two points. I
                    didn't take it the next year. I graduated, and decided to go to law school. I
                    was accepted at Columbia Law School. I had very good scores on the law school
                    aptitude test, and Columbia Law School is really a great school. They have some
                    marvelous professors. I didn't take the exam in '49 or '50, but I took it in '51
                    and again in '52. In '51, I took it at the last minute. I really wasn't trying
                    halfway, and I did worse. I missed it by two points the first time; I missed it
                    by 10 points the second time. Then the third time I scored, I passed it. My best
                    scores were in economics, even though I had not studied economics. I used to
                    read the financial pages. I was interested in that, and it was a lot of reading
                    of statistics and graphs and charts, which I was good at. Also general
                    knowledge. Remember the general knowledge tests?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. Well, this was a three-and-a-half-day exam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Right, international law, everything. It was a big writing exam. I was
                    just reading the other day in the paper about Varilla - you know Varilla, who
                    was connected with establishing the Panama Canal. That name was on the exam, I
                    remember. I don't think I knew who he was at that time. Yes, it was a
                    three-and-a-half-day exam, and I took it, and passed it. Then in '53, '54, I
                    took the oral exam. But before that you had to take the physical and pass the
                    security check. So they knew a lot about us when we went in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember any of the questions that were asked you
                        on the oral?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: They started off asking me why I wanted to come into the Foreign Service,
                    and the purpose of the exam was not really to find out how much you knew. They
                    assumed that they had a pretty good reading on that from the written exam. What
                    they tried to do was to get an impression of how you would be as a Foreign
                    Service officer, how you would handle yourself in a situation where you were
                    being opposed by somebody in an argument. They asked me about the voting age. At
                    that time, there was a lot of talk about reducing the voting age to 18, and the
                    arguments in favor. Then they wanted me to give the arguments against it. They
                    were trying to see whether you were flexible enough that you could see both
                    sides of a question. We talked about Abraham Lincoln. Some of the stuff I'm
                    giving now - they wanted to know my background, what schools I had gone to, why
                    I wanted to be a lawyer, why I wanted to come into the Foreign Service rather
                    than practice law, what experience I had had in practicing law at that time.
                    Then they ran over some words, and I bet you these were words that I had gotten
                    wrong on the exam. They asked me about some people. A name, I remember an
                    Italian name, a prominent figure, I guess, in Napoleon III's government,
                    Baretta?</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>Something like that. Then he asked me about the word condominium, which I should
                    have known about - the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, which was a condominium. And
                    nowadays everybody knows what a condominium is as far as housing is concerned,
                    but then it was not a word in wide use, and I really didn't know condominium. I
                    was trying to analyze it from my knowledge of Latin, con meaning 'with,'
                    dominium. That's what it is; it's sharing domain over something, which you do in
                    a condominium, or the public areas of it. Then they asked me to get up and go
                    over on a map the expansion of the United States, which apparently was a
                    standard question, but they started off by asking me what I thought about the
                    policy of massive retaliation and whether it was a new policy or not. It had
                    been on the pages of the New York Times that day. I should have known better
                    than I did. I said I didn't think it was really all that new. I think that we
                    would have relied on massive retaliation anyway because our military hadn't been
                    run down after World War II. They asked me if I was going with a girl. At that
                    time I had no plans to get married in the immediate future. I can't remember any
                    more questions. But I remember they tried to upset you. They tried to test you.
                    Rather than find out how much you knew, they tried to test you to try to put you
                    off, and then they wanted to know about working with people. They wanted to know
                    whether you thought you could work with people, to which I said, of course,
                    yes.</p>
                <p>I was different in that I heard later that normally there were three people on
                    the review. In my case there were five, including the Director General of the
                    Foreign Service. So I didn't score very high in that written exam. I'd passed,
                    but not with all that high a grade. I think I was really maybe a close case. I
                    met the other guy who was tested that day on the street later. He didn't pass,
                    and they told him they didn't take him because he was married and had a child
                    already. They thought that it was a little late for him. They couldn't say that
                    now, but they said that to him. I was a bachelor. They could send me anywhere.
                    They asked me if I was willing to go anywhere, and I said yes - go anywhere, do
                    what I'm told. I thought of it as like the army, where you go where you're sent
                    and you do what you're told. That still is a basic requirement, although some
                    people act like they don't believe it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you went into the Foreign Service when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>MARTIN: June 1st, 1954. I took the oath of office - they had called me up at home
                    two weekends before. They wanted me to come down immediately, and the reason
                    was, there was something called the Refugee Relief Act. It had been passed as a
                    successor to the Displaced Persons Act, which was over in about '49 or so. There
                    was much criticism that the refugee relief act was not being implemented fast
                    enough. President Eisenhower promised that he would implement it if he became
                    President, and he did. It took a while, and they still weren't implementing it
                    fast enough, and then apparently he said, “We're going to do it now, and I don't
                    want any more excuses.” So they took in a whole bunch of people at that time, in
                    early 1954, and they wanted us to go overseas immediately. I did not go into an
                    A-100 course. I had no introductory course to the Foreign Service, so I came in
                    in June. About the third week in June, I was on a ship, the America, on my way
                    to Bremerhaven and then to Bonn. At that time, the authority for personnel
                    assignments was delegated to the Personnel Office in Bonn. I read at one time
                    one-tenth of all the Foreign Service officers were assigned to Germany during
                    the occupation.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is February 11th, 1999. Doug, let's go back. You
                        said you wanted to pick up some points we didn't cover last time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes, I wanted to make three points, really. We talked about nuns, and you
                    said, “you know they use to hit us”. That's true. At the same time, there
                    couldn't have been a better relationship between the home and the school, and
                    the Catholic schools liked to say “home and school,” rather than
                    “parent-teachers.” Believe me, my family was supporting school. I had to do well
                    in school, because the family expected me to. The nuns were strict, but there
                    was a feeling that they were on our side and that they were trying to help us
                    get ahead. When you look back, that whole Catholic school and immigrant
                    population, up to and after World War II, up to about 1960, was really a
                    remarkable thing in American history because it doesn't exist in the same way
                    any more. It was almost a kind of aid program that the bishops carried out that
                    benefited the immigrant population.</p>
                <p>Then I wanted to say something about this idea of all politics being local. The
                    local Democratic captain came around to my mother once and asked her to become
                    the block leader. We were always Democrats. Everybody knew that. But she said,
                    “Richie, I'm voting for Eisenhower.” He said, “That's okay, Mrs. Martin, you've
                    just got to remember Rooney, Fiore, and Kalish.” John Rooney was our
                    congressman. And my mother said, “Just make sure people get out the vote and
                    remind them we can't forget John Rooney,” not that he was in trouble. But when I
                    hear all politics are local, this thing that the Speaker of the House, Tip
                    O'Neil, became famous for: that's what I think of.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>The third point. I mentioned Franco and how we were anticommunist, patriotic and
                    so forth. I didn't mention Joe McCarthy, because during that time, we were
                    almost violently anticommunist, and there was a feeling that President Roosevelt
                    had given away Eastern Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Yalta Agreement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Yalta, everything. This couldn't have been done unless there was some
                    skullduggery, unless there was something, and so people believed there was
                    Communist influence. When McCarthy came along and played on that note, believe
                    me, he got a responsive chord. In that Irish neighborhood where I grew up,
                    McCarthy could have been elected President if he'd wanted to be. Looking back, I
                    personally was right with him up until he attacked General Marshall. I was a
                    great fan of General Marshall, I had read the World War II report, and when
                    McCarthy attacked him, I said there's something the matter here. This guy is
                    crazy. It turned out he was a loner, so he really had no support in the Senate
                    from any other senators. He was a drunk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He died of cirrhosis of the liver.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes, and after he was censured, people wouldn't invite him to things at
                    all, they really ostracized him, and he just vanished and became an alcoholic.
                    What has only come out in the past year or two are these Verona Tapes that show
                    that the Rosenbergs were guilty. Alger Hiss, guilty. And he said there were a
                    hundred or something Communists in the US Government. Well, it turned out there
                    were more than that. The Verona Tapes show there were agents, not just in the US
                    Government, but around the country, people supporting them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the Verona Tapes - these were intercepts of
                        telegrams between Soviet officials showing that the American Communist Party
                        was fully supported and acting as an agent of the Soviet Union.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Right. People didn't believe that at the time. Anyway, I want to say that
                    McCarthy, as it turns out, that his assertions about the number of Communist
                    agents around were true, and people who supported Alger Hiss were wrong. There
                    are still guys in DACOR - not still, one died recently - but he worked with
                    Alger Hiss, and was a great admirer of Alger Hiss.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know. I remember, I really felt very early on that Alger
                        Hiss, one, was guilty and, two, he let the side down. You went to Bonn in
                        '54.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Right.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were a part of what, the Refugee Relief
                        Program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Bonn from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: I was only in Bonn for about a week. At that time, personnel authority
                    within Germany was controlled in Bonn. Later on it was taken to Washington, but
                    at that time, people were assigned to Germany, and then in Bonn they'd be
                    assigned wherever needed. I knew I was going to be an immigrant visa issuing
                    officer, and I knew I was going to be somewhere in one of the posts but not at
                    the embassy. So as soon as I got there, they told me that I'd be going to
                    Berlin. I had been told that I'd be assigned to one of four places, and I was
                    hoping to go to either Hamburg or Munich. I didn't want to go to Frankfurt. And
                    I didn't really want to go to Berlin, either. Well, going there was one of those
                    lucky things, and I've had some other lucky breaks like that. The best place for
                    me to be was Berlin. Somebody once asked me whether I got the posts I wanted in
                    the Foreign Service, and I said, “You know, I always got the post I wanted, but
                    I never realized it until I was there about eight months.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I just like to get at the beginning of each of these
                        sections, you were in Berlin from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: I was in Berlin from '54 to '56.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Although I was technically with the Refugee Relief Program, there was
                    another vice-consul, an older guy, a staff officer, Tom Burke. He was very happy
                    to take over that kind of work, and they wanted me to get more general
                    experience. It was really good that they did that. People were really good to
                    me. So they set me up as a visa issuing officer. We issued about a hundred
                    immigrant visas a month, and about 50 soldiers from the Sixth Infantry would get
                    married every month, and then we had about 150 non-immigrant visas. When I first
                    got there, the quota was filled, but it was soon beginning to show signs that
                    not everybody who had signed up to emigrate would go; when you asked them if
                    they still wanted to go, they changed their minds. Things were changing in
                    Germany. But pretty soon the quota opened, and from then on, when a person came
                    to me, if they wanted to immigrate into the US and they qualified, they could
                    go. It was a very easy consular assignment to have.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a bit about Berlin in the '54 to '56
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: This was the height of the Cold War, or almost the height, and you
                    couldn't just go over into East Berlin. People had to be told when you were
                    going over there. The whole post was set up, because of the importance of
                    Berlin. The chief of mission was the ambassador. The deputy chief of mission was
                    the military commander, a two-star general. And the State Department officer in
                    charge was the assistant chief of mission. And we also had a section that just
                    looked at what was going on in East Germany and East Berlin. And of course,
                    there were very close relations with the military, and there were, everybody
                    knew, a large number of intelligence agencies operating in Berlin at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>I did general consular work. I had some death cases I dealt with, very
                    interesting, and I had some interesting visa cases. I had one case of a fellow,
                    a soldier, black. He wanted to marry a woman. He had three children from three
                    different tours in Germany by that woman, and her name was on a list. We had
                    very good information there. It showed that this woman had signed up to be a
                    member of the Communist Party in Kassel, Germany. She told me that she didn't
                    realize she was joining the Communist Party, that she needed a house - she had
                    no place to live - and they said, if you want an apartment, you have to sign the
                    paper. She signed up, and her name was forever after on the list.</p>
                <p>She was barred, but at that time there were two exceptions. One was an
                    involuntary member of the Communist Party or of some cover organization or a
                    defector. We were looking for defectors of some sort, but I never was able to
                    find one. I sent in a request for an advisory opinion to the Department stating
                    the case, and I really thought this woman was an involuntary member of the
                    Communist Party, and she had three children. The father was an American sergeant
                    there, and he wanted to legitimize his children and marry the woman. They sat on
                    the case for a very long time, but eventually they came back and okayed it. I
                    think that's quite remarkable, and I wonder if anybody in Germany at that time
                    was ever able to get anybody through as an involuntary member of the Party
                    rather than a cover organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cover organizations, that wasn't too difficult, but no,
                        not the Party.</hi>

                <p>MARTIN: A large number of the people who came in to us were from the east. They
                    were refugees who had come through West Berlin from East Germany and East
                    Berlin. I knew all about how people came through. They had to give up their
                    papers. We had a congressional visit one time by a Congressman Eagan, from Ohio.
                    He was worried that people were streaming in from the East and coming to the
                    United States, and that the Communists were invading us, which was pretty much
                    nonsense. He took a little convincing. We had to show him exactly how the system
                    operated. When people came in, they had to go to a camp, and give up their East
                    papers. They were debriefed. There was a record of them. Then they got West
                    Berlin papers. If they eventually came to us, we saw them and treated them like
                    every other applicant. The general situation in Berlin then was rather peaceful.
                    One year before, there had been demonstrations right at the East Berlin line,
                    the June 17th [1953] uprising, and that came shortly after uprisings in Poland.
                    And it preceded what happened in Hungary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a serious time. I was a GI in Germany. I remember
                        we were confined to the barracks because they didn't know what would happen,
                        and you know, the troops were kept ready.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Right. One of the big events that occurred when I was there was the
                    tunnel, the famous tunnel in Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you explain what that was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: The CIA came up with the idea of constructing a tunnel. The guy's name
                    was Harvey, Bill Harvey. He had been an FBI man, and he was the head of the CIA
                    station in Berlin. He was pretty much of a daredevil. Later on Kennedy admired
                    greatly what happened. Harvey eventually got involved with the Cubans, and
                    because of his FBI connections and, like the mafia, I think he was the one who
                    tried to get the exploding cigar to Castro, which didn't work. I think a lot of
                    their ideas didn't work, but this one worked in a magnificent way. The tunnel
                    was built. It was obvious when I was there that this one intelligence group,
                    which turned out to be the CIA (they never said that) were very, very secret.
                    They were doing something. It was apparent that it was very important from what
                    people were saying, and it was very, very secret.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>After a while, there was something there called the Allied Travel Office and the
                    Interzonal Facilities Bureau. These were remnants of the Cold War, because in
                    1955, the occupation of Germany ended, and General McCord made a speech about it
                    at that time that they were going to change. But it didn't end in Berlin. Berlin
                    was still an occupied place, and the Allied Travel Office provided the
                    documentation for American officials in Berlin. It just happened that the guy
                    who was doing that work, an employee of the intelligence agency, went home, and
                    they asked me to replace him for a couple of months. I stamped all of the
                    passports of all of the officials - or had them stamped and signed them - the
                    official Americans in Berlin. There were several hundred of them, maybe a
                    thousand. And the Interzonal Facilities Bureau was set up to control the travel
                    of Soviet officials between West Berlin and West Germany - not West Berlin,
                    because the city was open. When they wanted to go to West Germany, they had to
                    go to the Interzonal Facilities Bureau and get an application. Then I had a
                    procedure to follow. I had to notify USAREU (United States Army Europe)
                    headquarters, and then they arranged for these guys to come. They had to tell us
                    exactly when they were coming, what crossing point they were going to go
                    through, and obviously people would be there to watch them. We had very close
                    relations with all the intelligence agencies there. They would tell us stuff,
                    and we would also provide them with our files if they wanted to look at it. At
                    the Interzonal Facilities Bureau, I used to go there half a day. On almost a
                    daily basis, I would be going over to East Berlin and applying for permits for
                    Americans to go into East Germany, and we would ask for a [Russian permit?].
                    Well, they didn't like that. They wanted us to go to the East German Government,
                    which we did not recognize. When a Russian wanted to come, he had to come to us.
                    One day, this intelligence guy came to see me and said, “This afternoon, you're
                    going to get five requests for permission to go into West Germany from
                    Russians.” And he said, “You're going to get them. It's very important that you
                    get the passports of these three guys.” I said okay. It was interesting because
                    just at that time our ambassador in Moscow said, if we wanted to go to East
                    Germany, we had to give our passports. They would give us their ID cards. A
                    practice had developed where we accepted that, and when Toon came in, he said,
                    “No, no more. If we have to give our passports, they have to give us theirs.”
                    Reciprocity, basic principle of diplomacy, I guess. Anyway, when I asked them
                    for that, they screamed. They didn't want to do it. They were very reluctant to
                    do it. They would have excuses. This guy said, “You're going to get these five
                    applications, make sure you get these passports”. I think the passports were
                    looked at by somebody, I reckon NATO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right, sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>MARTIN: They were running the passports next door and taking pictures and giving
                    them back. I worked in conjunction with my two colleagues, my French and British
                    opposite numbers. When somebody came in, I would hand it to the guy and say,
                    “It's being typed now. I'll be right back,” and make some kind of a crazy
                    excuse. One thing we did do, and which was playing on a weakness of the Russians
                    - they are a very sloppy people. They cannot fill out an application correctly.
                    There'll be spelling errors, there'll be dates wrong, there'll be blanks and so
                    forth. So this always was our excuse. We had to examine the application
                    carefully. In the meantime, we were getting pictures of the passports.</p>
                <p>Sure enough, a guy came in, and he said, “This is important. We have to get this
                    out by tomorrow.” I said, “Okay, let's see the passport.” He said, “These three
                    men are traveling in East Germany. I don't have their passports. I only have
                    their military ID's.” “Sorry.” It was interesting how they were fighting to
                    avoid giving their passports. I later found out that anybody could issue those
                    military ID cards, but the passports were issued in Moscow. The passports had a
                    higher validity or a higher level of authenticity, and that's why the CIA guy
                    wanted them. The guy eventually came through with the passports. I wondered at
                    that time, how did this guy that I dealt with in the intelligence office know
                    that these three guys were not likely to have the passport? Later, when the news
                    of the tunnel came out, I said, “Now I know”.</p>
                <p>I talked to somebody since then who told me they got so much information that
                    they're still processing some of it. He said, “I doubt if what you say (about
                    the three passports) is true. I doubt if they were that good.” But I think they
                    were that good. They were listening for certain calls, and they were looking for
                    any calls that came from that source.</p>
                <p>I did that for about three months, every day going over to East Berlin and seeing
                    the Soviet officer who was my opposite number and also another Soviet officer
                    who became somewhat famous later on, a guy named Khriboshei. Khriboshei is
                    mentioned in a number of books. Later, he apparently established a contact with
                    somebody in Berlin who was annoyed that he wasn't promoted and he went in and
                    offered to give information to the Soviets, and he dealt with Khriboshei, who
                    spoke English and was in the habit of showing up in West Berlin. Whenever there
                    was some kind of a function, Soviet nurses - pretty hot army nurses - Khriboshei
                    would turn up with them. He was obviously a very active character. He cultivated
                    his contact, an army sergeant who went to the United States. They followed him,
                    in the sense that they told him, “When you're coming up for assignment, let us
                    know.” They told him to apply to go to NATO, and he did. He got the combination
                    to the safe, because he worked right there. An officer had the combination, but
                    he was a little careless. One night, the Soviets came into our NATO headquarters
                    and took away a bundle of documents.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>That guy was later caught, convicted, and sentenced to jail. His son fought in
                    Vietnam. The son went to see him in jail and stabbed him and killed him. It's
                    all been told in a book called KGB, I think. He tells how the KGB would recruit
                    people. They never tried to get people on ideological grounds. You see,
                    Americans are not susceptible to that kind of a plea. They get them on blackmail
                    or some disgruntlement or money.</p>
                <p>I had some interesting death cases. We had a couple of women officers and they
                    asked me to do them. A guy was dead in a hotel. The hotel owner wanted me to get
                    the body out so they could fill the room. I said, “I'm sorry, we have to call
                    the police.” The police came, and I did the inventory of the guy's effects. It
                    was rather pathetic because he had a bunch of calling cards in his wallet, all
                    in Hoboken, all on one street, and they were from Charlie's Bar, Al and Phil's
                    Bar and Grill, Mike's Bar and Grill. He was going to send postcards back to his
                    buddies. He had turned 65, just got his first Social Security check, and went
                    straight over here. He said he was interested in genealogy, but he was born in
                    K�nigsberg, which was then Kaliningrad. You couldn't go there at all. I don't
                    know what he was going to do.</p>
                <p>When we sent the telegram back, the daughter answered, “He must have had” - I
                    think she said - “$6,500 on him.” It turned out the ticket had cost $1,500 and
                    he had a little less than $5,000. She still said, “Oh, that $1,500 must be
                    there. What happened? Who stole it?” She picked out the cheapest possible
                    outcome, which was burial locally. We arranged for him to be buried in the
                    Central Cemetery in Berlin, and there was a Lutheran pastor there, a very nice
                    guy, who was head of the German-American Association. We agreed this guy must
                    have been a Lutheran. We made him a Lutheran after he died, because 99 per cent
                    of the people who were born in K�nigsberg were.</p>
                <p>He got a Lutheran funeral with one Catholic present - that was me - and nobody
                    else, and it was very interesting anyway to go through that experience. I really
                    look upon that as a great time. People used to avoid consular work or complain
                    about consular work, but I enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel under any particular threat during this '54
                        to '56 period. Here you are in Berlin, surrounded by the Soviets? What was
                        the feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: People talked about world events, but there was no “feeling.” Somehow we
                    had a lot of confidence in the US military, that somehow nothing was going to
                    happen. Things were going on, so there might be a confrontation, and nobody
                    wanted to think what would happen in Berlin itself if war broke out. It's
                    obvious that there couldn't be resistance there. We just would have been
                    captured, that's all. But nobody was concerned. In fact, I wanted to stay
                    longer.</p>
                <p>I got married while I was there, and had my son while I was there, my first

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your wife German?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: My wife was Hungarian. I was there six or seven months before I got
                    married, because at that time, to marry an alien, you had to get permission. I
                    would not have gotten permission to marry a Hungarian, but she was already in
                    the United States when I met her and graduated from an American university,
                    graduated from Manhattanville College, which is where the Kennedy daughters
                    went. We agreed she would become a citizen, and then come over, so I didn't have
                    to ask anybody's permission to get married. I just had to notify the government
                    that I had gotten married. Since she was from Hungary and spoke German she was a
                    great advantage to me. She had gone for a year to the University of Munich and
                    had spoken German since she was a kid. Her ethnic background is really more
                    German than Hungarian. Her father was a three star general in the Hungarian
                    army, the highest-ranking general, when he got pushed out in 1936. He told me
                    when he and Admiral Horthy had conversations, they spoke German to each other,
                    even though it was Hungary. It was a carry-over from the Austro-Hungarian
                    Empire. He had gone to Austro-Hungarian military schools all the way
                    through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In West Berlin, did you ever travel into East Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Oh, yes, I used to go there all the time. When I had this job for three
                    months, I went there every day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of East Germany and the

                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: It was like going from life into death. The West was booming. Right down
                    by the East Berlin border it was still all smashed down. You could see evidence
                    of the bombing of Berlin everywhere, but at the same time there was also a
                    tremendous reconstruction. Germany was pretty much back by that time, and East
                    Berlin was not. There was a stream of people coming across every week, and later
                    on, when I worked on the German Desk, just before the Wall went up, there were
                    about 5,000 a week coming across. All the way through the Cold War, there were
                    between 3,000 and 5,000 refugees coming to the West, almost all of them through
                    West Berlin, because you could get on a subway and go to West Berlin from East
                    Berlin. The controls were very limited. Later on, they started to put more and
                    more controls on, and then they put the Wall up that made it impossible.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>You would not make an effort to get into conversation with people, because you
                    might get them in trouble, and they would be very nervous about that. But you
                    could go over, and you could go to bookstores, and into the caf�s. The East
                    German currency was worth much less than the West German. The exchange rate was
                    very favorable, and you could walk over there any time, just get on the subway
                    and go over. Going to East Germany was a different story. There you had to get
                    permission, but I did make a couple of trips. One time it would open up would be
                    for the Leipzig Fair every year, and I went to the Leipzig Fair three times when
                    I was there. There used to be a spring and a fall fair. I remember a
                    conversation I had with a family. In Leipzig, of course, you would go to a
                    housing office, and they would assign you to a place, a private house. The
                    family would make money during the fair by having guests. You could talk to
                    them. And it was interesting to go to church there; that was mainly a Protestant
                    area, Leipzig.</p>
                <p>And I remember one conversation with a young woman. She, and a kid, 16 years old,
                    and her father and mother and I were having a talk. We were talking about how
                    World War II got started, and I explained to them that Germany had declared war
                    on the United States. She couldn't believe it. And then her father told her,
                    yes, the Japanese attacked the United States, and the next day, Hitler declared
                    war on the United States, because they had this agreement with the Japanese. She
                    was shocked by it, and then she said, “Oh, that was a terrible mistake.” The
                    truth wasn't getting through all the time to people in the East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the Leipzig Fair used? What was our feeling about
                        the Leipzig Fair as a trade fair?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: The Leipzig Fair had its roots back in the middle ages, a crossroads
                    area. This was a place where any company went that wanted to do business with
                    East Germany. They used to claim also that doing business in the whole Soviet
                    Bloc could be done by going to the Leipzig Fair and participating or at least
                    attending it. All the countries would come and have exhibits - all the countries
                    from the East, the Soviets and Hungarians and Poles would have big exhibits -
                    and then American companies would go if they had an interest in doing business
                    there. I don't think it really was all that good because there was something in
                    those days called the Interzonal Trade System. Later it was incorporated into
                    the Treaty of Rome. As far as trade was concerned, East Germany and West Germany
                    were considered one, and there were no customs. The trade would take place, and
                    all West German firms could trade in the East very easily. So the way for an
                    American firm to participate in trade with East Germany was not to go directly,
                    but to find a German company that was doing business. Still, from the political
                    point of view, everybody wanted to go for a chance to get into the East, a
                    chance to get into the Soviet Zone. I was happy to make those trips.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>I also got a chance once to go by car from Berlin to Hamburg by the road that was
                    not the regular Autobahn to the West, not the Helmstedt thing. But to go
                    directly, the direct route and to go through East Germany and to see how poor
                    those farmers were - I think that must be a poor area any time, but it was
                    really poor. The war had gone right through there, but I don't think the war had
                    done that much. It just was poor from the start.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The war had pretty well ended by the time that fell. That
                        was just the tail end of the war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes, but that was still very interesting, to go through that area.
                    Anyway, I loved it in Berlin, and actually I went back on a private trip, my
                    wife and I, and we went to all the places I had gone to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much contact with the West Berliners while
                        you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Oh, yes. You could have a lot of contact with them, and while I was a
                    bachelor, I went out with quite a few German girls. I also made contact with a
                    couple of people. One guy was studying to be a doctor. He had a friend who was a
                    visa applicant who was a priest, or studying to be a priest. He was going to
                    California. This guy wanted to make contact with an American. His father was a
                    doctor, and I learned something about the German medical system, which of course
                    went back to the time of Bismarck and was socialized medicine. Because he lived
                    down near the East Berlin border, he still had a lot of patients from East
                    Berlin who could come over to him. He had a problem with money, getting money
                    from them, because their money was worth nothing. So he used to collect this
                    East Berlin money.</p>
                <p>I used to go out to West Germany at that time. I went skiing. That was a lot of
                    fun. Being a bachelor gives you a lot of freedom that you don't have otherwise,
                    so that was very enjoyable. But after I was married, we had a baby just 10
                    months later and so that ties you down a little bit.</p>
                <p>I was very lucky with one case there. And life happens this way. Maids would come
                    in very often when they had a relationship with an American soldier, and they
                    could only get permission if they could get a visa to go to the States. And so I
                    was the one that decided that. This case had been looked at before by somebody
                    else who had turned it down. Anyway, when she came to me I looked at it and
                    said, “There's no reason to turn this woman down.” I said, “We should issue the
                    visa.” I wrote up a little summary as I saw the case. But then my boss, Virginia
                    Ellis, a very nice lady, said, “Oh, these people, oh, these . . .” She used to
                    have a funny viewpoint about Germans; she didn't like the Germans getting visas,
                    basically.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was one of the problems we had often, particularly in
                        those days, I think, with our visa officers. Often they came with really
                        rather limited outlooks.. I had the same thing down in Frankfurt, and so
                        they would allow their personal feelings to be very much a problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: I was very much influenced by my legal training, because the requirements
                    were there. It was very simple. If you had any legal training you would see
                    because these women were being turned down as prostitutes, and they were not
                    prostitutes. That's ridiculous. No more than say, Monica Lewinsky's a
                    prostitute. Loose living and accepting gifts. That's not prostitution. But some
                    of these people had that attitude. Anyway, there was something else with her
                    too. She didn't want to change a decision that was made.</p>
                <p>The first time I met Betty Toon, the wife of the new consul, the first thing she
                    did was hit me with this case that her maid had been treated badly at the
                    consulate and she shouldn't have been turned down. I said, “I don't know
                    anything about it.” I couldn't remember the specific case at that point, but
                    when he came in, the first case he looked at, he saw that I had said she should
                    be issued a visa. He told his wife that too. From then on, he was on my side. I
                    got along extremely well with him. And he also liked that I was going down, when
                    I had this job in the Interzonal Facilities Bureau. There I was responsible for
                    an entire building, all the army property. I was assigned it because the 1954
                    Foreign Ministers' Conference had taken place in that building. It's where the
                    Air Traffic Control Center was. But I was the one who was signed out for 1,000
                    cups, 1,000 saucers, 1,000 sets of silverware, and all kinds of stuff that was
                    all there. It was the largest building in Berlin, downtown. Of course, I
                    occupied just a little office with a huge number of files, because it had been
                    the control system for all travel within Germany.</p>
                <p>Crazy things would happen. For example, one day we got an emergency call from
                    Tempelhof Airport. There was some German guy at the airport, and they were
                    looking at his papers and they had some kind of a lookout card on him. The
                    lookout, when I looked at the guys file, for some reason it said “This man not
                    to be allowed to travel into Berlin.” And here he was in Berlin; should they let
                    him out? I said - well, I mean, you don't have to be a brilliant logician to
                    figure that if he shouldn't be in here, let him out - So I said, “Let him out.”
                    They let him go, and they didn't hear any more from it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this part of the Berlin Document Center?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>MARTIN: No. That was located somewhere else. The Berlin Document Center was where
                    all the Party records were, and when I was in German affairs, I got involved
                    with some of those cases, too. Some of them were extremely interesting. The
                    Germans saved all their papers, and then we captured them all, which was very
                    good. We almost had more information than we wanted to have. But some of the
                    more interesting stuff in there were these cases of the Nazi court trials,
                    because besides the whole German legal system, the Party had its own system, and
                    the Nazi Party could try people and impose sentences on them, and execute them.
                    And somebody was writing a book later on when I was in German affairs, and we
                    had these various cases. To read them was really kind of pathetic. There was a
                    fellow, a priest who was executed for telling a joke about Hitler - just a
                    simple, ordinary joke. Somebody turned him in, and he confessed that he had told
                    that joke, and said he didn't mean any harm by it. Then they accused him of
                    having a defeatist attitude towards the war (he probably thought they were going
                    to lose the war - a lot of people had as it wore on) and the guy was executed.
                    There were maybe a couple of dozen cases where people were executed that we had
                    records on from the Berlin Document Center.</p>
                <p>But I was down there and I visited the Center. We knew all the people, the
                    Americans, there. I think eventually, didn't we turn the Center over to the
                    Germans?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we microfilmed everything and turned it back to
                        the Germans at the end, only quite recently, as a matter of fact.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes, I know it was not too long ago. A lot of these things are still
                    happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me see, then in '56 - when did you leave Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: I left Berlin in September, but let me just mention a couple of other
                    cases I had, or one in particular. There was a woman who applied for a visitor's
                    visa, and there was in her record that she was a drug addict and she was on a
                    list that doctors got because people who were drug addicts would tell a story to
                    a doctor in order to get certain drugs. Anyway, she also had a positive
                    Wassermann - which meant she had syphilis, at least in her body. But it had been
                    stopped because penicillin stopped it dead in its tracks. In her case the
                    medical requirements were that they had to do a spinal tap to determine if the
                    brain had been involved. I remember the doctor came to me, and said, “You know,
                    I really don't want to do this if I don't have to. Would you please reverse the
                    usual procedure, and interview her first? If you're going to turn her down, then
                    I won't do that. She'll just be turned down.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was not a very comfortable procedure, a spinal
                        tap.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>MARTIN: Dangerous and painful, and something could go wrong, too. So I remember
                    that case. And then there was another case where somebody I issued a visa to
                    went to Italy and took the Andrea Doria to the United States. She was on the
                    ship when it went down. She was saved, but the headlines in all the Berlin
                    papers were “Berliner Goes Down with the Andrea Doria but Rescued.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any Americans who would get to Berlin and run
                        out of money, and you had to get them out of there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes, and it was a funny case, because one of the guys that was with me, a
                    staff officer who was one of the other vice-consuls, whenever he had a difficult
                    case like that, very often, he'd get them to Bremen. We used to send them to
                    Bremen, and then they would eventually maybe go to Bremerhaven and then to the
                    States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Get them on a troop ship.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Get them on a ship. In other words, get them to the next consular
                    district, which is an old consular trick, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Anyway, he was always doing that, and darned if he wasn't transferred to
                    Bremen - because, you know, they could transfer us within the country. Then he
                    was complaining that we were sending cases to him that we should have handled
                    ourselves!</p>
                <p>There had been an annual ball in Berlin before the war, and there was a slush
                    fund, not very large but large enough; and the consular officer dealing with
                    passports and citizenship could disburse it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The money for this was generated by the ball.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: The ball, yes. The custodial fund - it's all against the rules now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>MARTIN: They don't allow that at all. Even then it was probably against the
                    rules. But it was there, and it was approved, and everybody knew about it. There
                    was no dishonesty involved. And then we had Lutheran nuns who ran some sort of a
                    guest house, and we used to put people up there for a couple of days until
                    arrangements could be made for them to leave. They would come in to complain
                    about the place as you couldn't read because they said there was only a 25-watt
                    bulb in the middle of the room. The quarters were not particularly comfortable.
                    And we would say, you know, “You don't have any money to stay anywhere; this is
                    all we can afford. We can't put you up in a hotel. You've got to stay there.” It
                    was practically free.</p>
                <p>Because of the special status of Berlin, the commanding general had the authority
                    to expel people, Americans, from the American sector. We had a case of a
                    character, an American tourist who came, and he met some guy on the street, an
                    American who conned him into buying some Hitler souvenirs and a camera from East
                    Germany - Zeiss, from East Germany. He was going to get him a Zeiss camera if he
                    would give him 600 marks. He would meet him the next day on the corner there and
                    have the camera and the souvenirs. Well, of course, the next day the guy was not
                    there, so the American tourist went to the police. The police said, “What did he
                    look like?” and they said, “Wait a second, is this the guy?” They had his
                    picture. They knew who it was right away. He was wanted for burglary in several
                    different states. He was a combination burglar and con man, and he had been
                    living with a German woman and he had a child. She had tuberculosis, and was
                    about to be put into the sanitarium, so I was going to break up the
                    relationship. He was pretty much ready to go back to the States anyway, but they
                    tossed him in jail, and I went to see him. I used to bring him cigarettes and
                    chocolate bars to keep him going. He complained it. A German jail can be pretty
                    tough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: German jails were not pleasant. I mean, if you've got to
                        do it, go somewhere else.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Denmark, yes, someplace like that. German jails are cold in the winter,
                    and I don't think the food is all that good. So he wanted some help. While his
                    case was being processed, the general signed the expulsion order. We had a
                    liaison officer with the police, and it would be an American policeman doing
                    that work. One of them came to me and said, “Well, this is a bad guy”. I was
                    going to escort him out of the country, to Bremerhaven. We were going to put him
                    on a troop ship. And this fellow said, “Oh, you've got to watch him. . . .
                    dangerous and so forth.” I said, “Well, he seemed okay when I talked to him in
                    jail.”</p>
                <p>We got on the troop train to Bremerhaven and then to Bremen from Bremerhaven. We
                    stopped in the morning in Bremen. You remember the train used to take a couple
                    of hours to get there. I was asleep. Later on, when we all got up and were on
                    our way, he said, “You know, Mister, I could have escaped. I could have escaped,
                    but I didn't want to get you in trouble.” He was a con man.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>When we got to the ship, he wanted to know where he was going to be on the ship.
                    He thought he'd be up maybe in a stateroom or something. Well, on the troop
                    ship, I remember he said, “Well, where is that?” And the military guy who was
                    arranging said, “That's all the way down.” I mean, this guy was below decks. He
                    was in the bottom of that ship, but he had some cigarettes and chocolate bars I
                    gave him, and he had meal tickets for meals on the ship.</p>
                <p>Before we left Berlin, I was told, if he wants to escape, let him escape. The
                    general's jurisdiction extends only to the American Sector. Once the train pulls
                    out of the station, a half hour later, when we leave West Berlin, whatever he
                    does, don't put up any resistance; just let him go. But he didn't go, he wanted
                    to go home to the States, and then I never heard from him again. But that was
                    kind of a fun trip.</p>
                <p>Well, that pretty much completes my Berlin experience. I did get to know some
                    newspapermen there, a guy who wrote for Tagesspiegel who later became a TV
                    announcer. I don't know what happened to him. But anyway, my friend Erhard
                    Sundermann, whose father was a doctor, he is still around. I looked him up when
                    I was visiting Berlin. I knew I would be able to get in touch with him. I called
                    him. He's still there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In September of '56, where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: I came back to the United States. I was assigned there. During this whole
                    time I was in Berlin, something called “Wristonization” was going on, so the
                    trend was for people in Washington to become Foreign Service officers and go
                    overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were civil servants who were amalgamated into the
                        Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Right. For Foreign Service people, there were lots of openings in the
                    States. I was transferred to one. They wanted to put me into cultural affairs,
                    which I didn't want and didn't happen. But before I left, Mack Toon had talked
                    to me about what I was going to do in the future. I felt I was interested in
                    Eastern Europe, particularly after talking to my wife and her father. I felt I
                    knew a lot about the area. He recommended me for Russian language training and
                    sent in a very nice airgram. Anyway, I was not accepted for that. But they did
                    accept me for Eastern European language and area training, and they offered
                    Bulgarian, because by the time I got to the States, the Hungarian uprising had
                    taken place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: October of '56.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>MARTIN: October of '56, right. I was just arriving in Washington. They needed
                    people to help out on the Hungarian Desk. I helped out Jim Sutherland at that
                    time, an extremely interesting period for me. At the same time, I was being
                    processed for this Eastern European language and they said, kind of
                    apologetically, “Would I be willing to study Bulgarian?” I said, “Gee, Bulgarian
                    - I hadn't thought of that, but yes, sure, go ahead. I'll study Bulgarian.” A
                    few weeks later, they came to me, and said, “Look, because of what's happening
                    in Hungary” and because at that time we didn't recognize Bulgaria - we didn't
                    have diplomatic relations, but they were planning and they were going to have
                    people learning the language - they said, “We've decided to cancel that and
                    we've had another cancellation. Would you be willing to study Serbo-Croatian?” I
                    said, “Fine, I'll do it.” So I was waiting to go into Serbo-Croatian language
                    area. In the meantime, I worked on the Hungarian Desk, another fascinating
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about that because timing's rather important.
                        When did you start working on the Hungarian Desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: It would have been right after Maleta got shot. It was right after,
                    because I went home with my wife's family on home leave. In fact, I left earlier
                    than that. I didn't leave in September. I left earlier. Maybe I even left in the
                    end of July, beginning of August.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would make more sense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes. But I did complete home leave, and then reported to Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your father-in-law's reaction to this? Did he see
                        the Soviets coming in? What was the feeling that you got from him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: He was a very interesting character. At the age of 10 he was an orphan.
                    He was from the German gentry or lower nobility. He went to Austro-Hungarian
                    military schools. He was a captain and then a major at the end of World War I,
                    and on the Austro-Hungarian general staff. He had been in 10 battles on the
                    Italian front, where Hemingway went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure, this was the Italian campaign.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>MARTIN: Yea. He was in the Italian campaign and met Rommel at that time, because
                    Rommel led the war at the Battle of Caparetto. They brought in a special German
                    unit and made the attack. Later he was in the Hungarian General Staff and he was
                    the chief of the military chancery for Admiral Horthy. He was his military
                    advisor. Then he was chief of the General Staff. The prime minister got kidney
                    cancer and was sent off to Germany. He had been the prime minister and minister
                    of war. He didn't give up the prime minister job, but he gave up being minister
                    of war when he went to Germany. My wife's father became the minister of defense
                    for about six months. After World War II, he remained in Germany. His idea was
                    that the war might break out again. The Americans had the atomic bomb and would
                    win and the family could go back to Hungary. They were hoping to go back until
                    1948, when the Russians developed their atomic bomb, and he said it's a
                    stalemate, it won't happen. He was convinced that we would not go to war to
                    liberate Hungary. He was a very shrewd and also an objective thinker, not
                    emotional. He never joined any Hungarian refugee organizations and never tried
                    to play a role in any national council. He wrote a letter at the end of the war
                    to Admiral Horthy, when he first was planning to come to the US, to say that
                    “I'm going, and I'm going to become an American citizen, I hope, so I have to
                    break off any official contact with you.” Admiral Horthy was still in Portugal
                    writing letters to various people. My father-in-law encouraged his daughters to
                    be American. The other part of my wife's family encouraged them to stay
                    Hungarian, which I think has had a limiting effect on them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. In our culture, absolutely. Well, when you were
                        on the Desk, what was the attitude towards developments there, and what was
                        the focus.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: By then, it was very clear that we were not going to intervene. We tried
                    to calm the situation down. It was interesting that the Hungarian Desk officer,
                    Bob McKissin, went on leave just when the thing broke out. And there was another
                    funny thing. Hungary was in the Office of Balkan Affairs or the Balkan Affairs
                    Section. Every single Hungarian who came to talk with us, without exception,
                    would say, “Balkan Affairs? Hungary? No. Hasn't anybody told you, Hungary is not
                    in the Balkans?” Well, we say that is just as a designation. It doesn't really
                    mean anything. We know it's not in the Balkans. But they would always say
                    something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the Balkans - the Greeks never liked being included
                        in the Balkans either. The Balkans has a bad name. It continues today to be
                        the Balkans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: We were trying to calm things down. That was quite clear. The work was
                    overwhelming, because there were letters coming in all the time. I was there
                    right when things were happening in Budapest, right when the Cardinal Mindszenty
                    went into our Embassy.</p>
                <p>That happened a few days before I came on board. It got me into the European
                    Bureau. One of the first things I did was write a letter to George Meany.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the head of the..?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: He was a good letter writer. George Meany was the head of the AFL-CIO,
                    the most important labor leader in the United States. Originally a plumber from
                    the Bronx who worked his way up in the labor movement, he was fiercely
                    anticommunist. He wanted us to help the cardinal and wanted to know what he and
                    the labor movement could do. So I wrote a letter which I remember he said was a
                    good letter; he liked it, it went out, and he complimented me on it. That was
                    one of the first things I did in the Department that I would say was significant
                    or important.</p>
                <p>There were loads of other letters and telegrams to be sent out for people looking
                    up their relatives. What happened to so-and-so? There was a flood of people. I
                    think something like two per cent of the entire population left at that time.
                    The people wondered, where is my cousin? Did he come out? There was a lot of
                    liaison with the consular people, and people going over to work in Vienna. There
                    was more work than you could do, and so it was fascinating. I remember also
                    getting letters from various people who wanted to get money to the cardinal. The
                    cardinal from Montreal wanted to know if we could get some gold over to him. Of
                    course, we couldn't do any of those things, but it was extremely exciting to be
                    doing that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then did you go to Serbian?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes. I went to Serbo-Croatian. I started in January, and in September -
                    well, you know what language training is: every day. I was with Nick Andrews,
                    who later became the head of the office of Eastern European affairs, now retired
                    (I just saw him a few months ago), and also Oren Wilson, who later was in NATO
                    at our embassy. There's lots of embassies in NATO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you took Serbian from when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: From January until July.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of '57.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Of '57, yes. And it's intensive language training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have Janko Jankovic or Dragan Popovic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: I had Jankovic.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're lucky.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: I love him, wonderful guy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Popovic was a problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Later on, Popovic examined me when I came back. I qualified, barely. I
                    used to speak German with my father-in-law. My best language was German, and in
                    Zagreb, German was a very useful language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very much so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Also Hungarian was useful to my wife. But anyway, yes, Janko Jankovic. I
                    guess both of them are dead long since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, they were brothers-in-law.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Then I went to Berkeley, to the University of California at Berkeley.
                    Nick and Oren went to Columbia University. We had our choice: Columbia or
                    Berkeley. I had never lived on the West Coast, and I'm a New Yorker. I said
                    here's an opportunity. I'll take. And Oren and Nick were very happy because they
                    wanted to go to New York.</p>
                <p>When I got there we lived in Oakland, near Berkeley. Sometimes I drove, but most
                    of the time I took the bus. There was something called the Center for Slavic
                    Studies. It had a couple of professors there who were experts and they had a
                    well-known Russian. I had to take two courses for credit, but they would not let
                    us enroll in a degree program. Later on it changed. I had great freedom to study
                    whatever I wanted. I took a course in cultural history, “Western European
                    Cultural Thought,” by a famous professor. I wish I could think of his name, a
                    wonderful guy. He wrote one of the standard American history texts. And I took
                    my credit course in the history of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy.</p>
                <p>You had to write a paper. I wrote mine on Cardinal Stepinac, the cardinal in
                    Croatia. He was still in Zagreb at that time and still alive. I wrote a critique
                    of his trial, a typical Communist trial. I studied the language. I had a prof,
                    another guy I liked a lot, I kept in touch with him later on. He was named
                    Jelovic. He died not too many years later, even though he was young. He was of
                    Dalmatian background. He was American born, but in California. You know, along
                    the coast, there are lots of Croatians.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>There are fishermen from Dalmatia. Same thing in Chile; they have the same kind
                    of group. Ante Kadic was the name of my language teacher. He was a brilliant
                    guy. I enjoyed very much my studies there. I studied pretty hard and enjoyed it
                    a lot and learned a lot. I got some wrong ideas too, some of which got
                    straightened out when I got to Zagreb.</p>
                <p>Now at that time, the three of us were going to Yugoslavia. There were three
                    slots - two slots in the Political Section in Belgrade and one for deputy chief
                    of the consulate general in Zagreb. All three of us wanted to go to the embassy,
                    maybe because we thought that was better career-wise. It turned out they said,
                    “You're going to Zagreb.” I said okay.</p>
                <p>My father-in-law was very familiar with Zagreb. When he was in the General Staff,
                    he had spent two years in what he called Laibach, which was Ljubljana, the
                    capital of Slovenia, because he was the Austro-Hungarian General Staff officer
                    responsible for a division near Italy. Later on he was in the Italian section,
                    and he also did the micro scientific work. The Austro-Hungarian General Staff
                    had a railway section, a signaling section, a medical section - all that. All
                    this was scientific stuff in its own separate section. He handled all that, all
                    their technological things. He was the officer responsible for the Austrian
                    fliers. They didn't have an air force, but he was the first Austro-Hungarian
                    General Staff officer to fly across the Danube River, and his name was in the
                    paper because they made a big thing about it. But he said the problem then was
                    to get the pilots to do something, and most of them were killed in World War I,
                    not in plane crashes. They were killed in automobile crashes on their way down
                    to the front to fly, because they would transport the planes right close to the
                    lines and then they'd use them.</p>
                <p>He had been in the General Staff railway car when the news came in that Franz
                    Ferdinand had been shot. He said they knew right away that this was war because
                    the Austro-Hungarian General Staff was champing at the bit to have a preemptive
                    war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the assassination in Sarajevo in 1914.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Right. So they gave an ultimatum, which was something that the Serbians
                    could not possibly accept, and they forced the war to start. Anyway, he was
                    familiar with Zagreb. We got to Zagreb. There was no housing there. This was in
                    the early days, you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's see, you were in Zagreb from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>MARTIN: From 1956 to '57-58 - no, '58 to '60. At that time I was an FSO-5, which
                    is now the equivalent of FS-3. I was the deputy principal officer. The main
                    duties were East-West trade, end-use checks of export items, a lot of
                    specialized petroleum products. There was one fascinating case, which I'll
                    mention. My boss was a marvelous guy, the best boss I ever had in the Foreign
                    Service. I loved the guy, Ted Montgomery. He was a graduate of the Naval
                    Academy, 1924. I think he was supposed to be in the class of '23 but he got sick
                    and lost a year. So he went into the navy at a time when we were sinking our own
                    ships. So he left in the minimum time and settled in England, and he was a
                    wonderful writer. He wanted to be a playwright, and he wrote a couple of plays
                    that were produced. In fact, he used to get (and he really was so happy when he
                    did) a check every three months or so, and sometimes it would only be like $10
                    or $15. He would get a royalty on one play he had written which was in some kind
                    of a book of plays which could be done by local amateur theater groups. He was
                    married to a British woman. While he was in England, he was married to an
                    American, got divorced, and married this British woman during the war. She was a
                    little bit difficult, but nice. Ted Montgomery, as I say, was a writer, and he
                    wrote for the London News-Chronicle, and then during the war they didn't need
                    him. He loved cars and was the auto editor. But then during the war there was no
                    need for an auto editor, so he started doing political stuff.</p>
                <p>When I first arrived in Yugoslavia, I got a shock, because I had been studying
                    for nine months, and I had tried to keep it up by paying for tutoring in
                    California. When I arrived, I couldn't understand a word the guy was saying.
                    Well, it turned out he was speaking Slovenian, which is related but different,
                    and then when I got to Zagreb, it was still a shock because Croatian is
                    different from Serbian, and Janko Jankovic was definitely a Serb.</p>
                <p>I remember the first day my wife said to me - we were living in a hotel, but she
                    wanted to go and get some bread. She said, “What's the word for bread?” and I
                    said, “The word for bread is hleb,” which I had learned - hleb. Well, my wife
                    went to the store and said, “Hleb.” And they wouldn't pay attention to her. They
                    would ignore her. They could see she was a foreigner and an American, but that's
                    the way the Croats were. Finally, they said, “Kruh! Kruh! The word is Kruh!”
                    Well, the word is hleb, but I learned later, the word hleb is from a Gothic word
                    hl�ifs, which is an ancestor word of our word for loaf, and it has become the
                    word for bread in all the Slavic countries, but not Croatia. They have still
                    kept the pure, original word for bread - I guess - which is kruh.</p>
                <p>That was one example, but many, many common words, like the word for doctor are
                    different. The word for doctor in Serbian is lekar, and the word in Croatian is
                    le�nik - same root. But if you say lekar, they'll look at you, you know, and
                    they'll correct you. Since they always had good will toward us, it didn't cause
                    much of a problem. But my best language is German. I used to speak German at
                    home with my father-in-law, and he and I read The Decline of the West in German.
                    I did the whole thing and a couple of other books while I was in California,
                    because many of the books about Yugoslavia are written in German. And I wrote a
                    summary of a couple of books.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>When I first arrived in Zagreb, Elwood Rabinold was the consul, and he was about
                    to leave. He was not very helpful. He's retired and living on the Eastern Shore.
                    He's a very unsympatisch character, in the sense that he didn't give me any help
                    in finding a place. I was in a hotel. He said, “You have to talk turkey with
                    these people. You have to talk turkey with them.” Yes, you had to talk turkey
                    with them. Do you have any ideas? He didn't have any ideas. My predecessor was
                    living in a place, but somebody else took that place. So I was the odd man out
                    looking for a place.</p>
                <p>I finally found a place, and of course we wound up paying top dollar, and we let
                    the guy keep some stuff in the house locked up, which was okay, but my rent was
                    enough. We had a favorable exchange rate. We had a good rent allowance. The rent
                    I was paying was enough for him to go down to the Dalmatian coast, to Split,
                    where he was from originally, and to live there in a hotel. Can you imagine
                    that? Later on, Senator Stennis came to Zagreb for the Zagreb Fair, and he was a
                    nice guy. He said to me, “Mr. Martin, is there anything we can do, are there any
                    ideas you have, any thoughts you have, how we can improve conditions here?” He
                    may have mentioned the rent allowance. I said, “Don't increase the rent
                    allowance.” I told him, “The rent allowance would be good if we could buy places
                    and have them.” They did that later, but at the time, that was a no-no. I said,
                    “Don't increase the rent allowance because somehow the word gets out. When you
                    start negotiating, you go right up to your limit. No matter what happens, you
                    always wind up there in negotiations.” It used to happen here in Washington, if
                    you remember. You stayed at Alban Towers, the bill was always whatever limit the
                    government was paying - that's what you wound up paying. I think he was taken
                    aback that someone would tell him, don't increase a particular allowance.</p>
                <p>Rabinold was on his way out, and he was an ARA type for his whole career. He
                    spent his whole career there, a lot in Argentina. He used to sell the grass on
                    his house to a local peasant, and he had a little slush fund that he turned over
                    to me, which, again, was okay then, and I'm not suggesting anything wrong. He
                    was scrupulously honest about it. He had every penny accounted for, using it for
                    certain purposes that were reasonable. I was a little shocked. Zagreb was a
                    place where you could go down to the flower market (a beautiful thing; any town
                    that has a flower market is nice), and buy flowers — but they might be the
                    flowers from your garden that some peasant had clipped on his way down to the
                    flower market. Again, that didn't bother me much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the political situation? What were you doing
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>MARTIN: We were following Croatian nationalism and Serbian nationalism. Various
                    Balkan nationalisms are really very strong, unbelievably strong. As I reflected
                    already when I told you about he language, they were fiercely loyal to their own
                    language and didn't want to use any Serbian words. Everywhere you went, people
                    at a party or something, somebody would come up, “Hey, that guy over there -
                    he's a Serb . . . he's a Croat.”</p>
                <p>We were worried naturally about Communism in Yugoslavia and the relationship that
                    the Yugoslavs had with the Soviet Union. The breakaway had taken place in 1948.
                    We were pouring aid into Yugoslavia in order to support them in their
                    independence from the Soviet Union. Later on, people estimated that we put a
                    billion dollars in there. People now think we could have gotten away with half a
                    billion. We had all kinds of programs. There was a big AID program in Belgrade,
                    but I was not in the AID mission and really didn't have anything to do with the
                    AID mission. The head of the AID mission was also head of the economic section;
                    Len Weiss, a brilliant, young guy, and actually very nice.</p>
                <p>Within Zagreb, again, there was this nationalism and separatism. When I first
                    arrived, after Rabinold left, almost the same weekend, Ted Montgomery, the new
                    consul, arrived. We had three local employees, all in USIA. Over that weekend
                    one had committed suicide. Her husband had been carrying on an affair with
                    another USIA local employee, and so the first thing I told the new boss, we've
                    had a suicide. One of our employees committed suicide. He said, “Okay, tell the
                    man not to come to the office.” We got in touch with Belgrade, and they said,
                    “Fire him,” which we then did. He may have been half expecting it. That was
                    quite a way to get started.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Among my other duties was being security officer. Shortly thereafter,
                    this guy we had fired married the woman he had been having the affair with. One
                    of the librarians, an American librarian, asked me if she could go to the
                    wedding. She was invited; she had been good friends with them; she wanted to go.
                    I said, “Sure, go ahead, but keep in mind” - her boss didn't want her to go, and
                    so they came to me as security officer and said can she go. He was sort of
                    saying should she go to the wedding or not? I said, “Go ahead, she knows what
                    happened. Just use your own common sense and act accordingly. We're not going to
                    show any approval, and we're not going to change any decisions or anything. It's
                    okay.” She was happy with that.</p>
                <p>Our consular district included all of Croatia and Slovenia, and they had set up
                    recently a consulate in Sarajevo. If you haven't done it, you should interview
                    the guy who was our first consul down there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>MARTIN: I'll think of his name in a minute. He was a wonderful character, and I
                    refer to him when I talk to him today as my old sparring partner, because almost
                    the first thing that I heard about him was that “he's trying to steal part of
                    our consular district.” We were reporting, and his was the most prolific
                    reporting I've ever seen. He was good in language, and he was sending in tons of
                    stuff, far more than we were. I like to think that we sent in some better
                    quality stuff, but maybe I was wrong.</p>
                <p>He used to go to Dubrovnik, and he went to Split one time on a trip. Both were in
                    our consular district. He wrote a very funny and a very good airgram entitled
                    “Two Split Personalities,” about two journalists he talked to. Yugoslavia was a
                    wonderful place in that you could go to see anybody, and they would talk. They
                    would talk and talk and talk. You could say, “What do you think about the
                    situation in India?” You could get a half-hour discussion from the guy, and you
                    could write it all up and send it in. After a while I was doing that. If we'd
                    get any reaction from the Department, we'd do it. But our political reporting at
                    the beginning was very weak.</p>
                <p>People were very interested in Cardinal Stepinac, who was confined to his native
                    village. People would say under house arrest. He was not under house arrest, but
                    it was such a small village - only about 50 people - where he had been born and
                    raised, and he was living in the pastor's house in that place and couldn't
                    leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain who he was and why he was under
                        arrest.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Cardinal Aloysius Stepinac [Step-EE-natz] in this country is known as
                    STEP-in-ak. There were three cardinals at the end of World War II that the
                    Communists cracked down on - Mindszenty in Hungary, who was maybe more famous,
                    Stepinac (as people in the United States call him) in Zagreb, and Cardinal
                    Wyszynski in Poland. In Zagreb people say that Tito had tried to appeal to
                    Cardinal Stepinac in 1946. He had supported Croatian nationalism during the war.
                    He was not a Lustase supporter, but he was definitely a supporter of Croatian
                    independence.</p>

                <p>MARTIN: The Fascists. The Croats took a huge beating at the end of the war
                    because the Croatian army was under German command, and when the Germans were
                    finished, the German commander got instructions from Berlin to release the
                    Croatians from his command. He suggested that they might want to retreat to
                    Germany, which of course they did want to do - not Germany but Austria. They
                    fought their last battle against one little Bulgarian battery that blocked them
                    for an hour or so, and then they surrendered in Austria to the British. The
                    British had them lay down their arms, and the next day turned them back. Every
                    single Ustasi, whether he was officer or enlisted man, was executed right there.
                    And every single domobran - that was the Croatian regular army - every officer
                    was executed. The enlisted people were not executed. They were marched back to
                    Belgrade to work in labor camps. By the time I got there, they were all released
                    and back home.</p>
                <p>At the end of the war, Tito for political reasons, offered to support Cardinal
                    Stepinac if he separated from Rome and led an independent Croatian Catholic
                    Church; he refused. About a year later, he was put on trial. I wrote a paper
                    about the trial. It didn't meet our standards of justice. But he was sentenced
                    to jail. I think he was in jail. He may have been in a monastery for a while. He
                    contracted a disease called polycythemia vera, which is - he used to joke about
                    it - the opposite of leukemia. It's too many red corpuscles. It's the only
                    disease in medical science today where bleeding has some benefit - but only up
                    to a certain point. It causes clotting and all kinds of trouble. It's a fatal
                    disease.</p>
                <p>He was going to die eventually. They released him and let him go to his native
                    village, but he wasn't able to do anything. Legally, he had an interesting
                    status from the canonical point of view. Normally when a bishop can't function
                    any more, they appoint a coadjutor. In his case he could function. They wouldn't
                    appoint a coadjutor for him, but they appointed a coadjutor for the archdiocese,
                    a guy named éeper, who was the most impressive person I ever met in my life,
                    really a brilliant guy.</p>
                <p>We were supposed to be on the alert for anything relating to Stepinac and his
                    illness, because there were two doctors in Chicago who were treating him. The
                    treatment was an injection of a radioactive material. When they gave him his
                    first injection, there was an immediate dramatic improvement. He was completely
                    okay. Then he would be treated by bleeding and various drugs and blood thinners.
                    But it would get worse, and then he would get another radioactive shot. Each
                    shot had to be given at shorter intervals, and each was less effective than the
                    previous one. We were supposed to be on the lookout for that, and we were in
                    close touch with éeper, the coadjutor archbishop of Zagreb.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>When Rabinold was there, Rabinold said, “Don't go to see him.” My predecessor was
                    also a Catholic, and he would try to find out what was going on through a couple
                    of priests that he knew, but they really didn't know. Finally, there was a
                    report in Libre Belgique, a left wing Belgian newspaper which said that there
                    were negotiations going on between the Catholic Church and Tito's government in
                    Yugoslavia. They sent a copy to us and said, can you find out something about
                    this? And Montgomery, who was Episcopal, Church of England, a very nice person,
                    said, “Doug, how can you find out about this?” I said, “There's only one way.
                    I'm not going to talk to some nun and find out what's happening with
                    negotiations on a church-state matter. We should go to see the bishop.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Fine, let's go.” I wrote out a little note. The driver took it over.
                    The archbishop told him to wait. He wrote on his card, “Come right over. Happy
                    to see you.” I guess he wrote it in Croatian. The two of us went over to see
                    him, and he laid out the whole story, and when we said there'd been a report in
                    a Western newspaper that there were negotiations going on, he said, Libre
                    Belgique. They'd been in touch with him and told him that this item had
                    appeared. He said there's nothing to it, and there was, I guess, nothing to it
                    at that time.</p>
                <p>Still the climate was changing, and this was a big change, because in Yugoslavia,
                    in Slovenia, the Bishop of Laibach, Ljubljana, had been knocked down on a
                    railway platform by a bunch of teenage thugs; they poured gasoline on him and
                    set him on fire. Fortunately, he was burned around the neck and the ears, but
                    survived by rolling on the ground and somebody helped him a little bit. But the
                    situation in Croatia was much different, because the Communists tried to get all
                    the priests to join this Peace Association, a Communist mass association. They
                    had only 10 per cent success in Croatia. In Ljubljana, in Slovenia, they had 90
                    per cent success. And so the battle was really going on. We went to éeper. He
                    laid the whole thing out for us, and that started a relationship with him which
                    continues on, I'm sure, to this day, because I talk to Jack Scanlan, who went to
                    see the next cardinal. éeper had relatives in Connecticut. His successor is a
                    guy named Kuharic. Remember Joe Kuharic, the quarterback at Notre Dame?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: That was his nephew. A lot of Croats have relatives in the States. There
                    was a big emigration just before World War I. Everywhere you went, you ran into
                    them.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>Cardinal Stepinac died suddenly, and the funeral was to take place, we thought,
                    at the place where he died, Krausic. It's about 15 miles away from Zagreb, a
                    little village. We said we wanted to go. Ted Montgomery told me that we wanted
                    to go to the funeral. Of course, he was a little hesitant. He wasn't sure. “But
                    go over and tell the government that we want to know what's happening.” They
                    didn't give me an answer. We used to deal with a guy who dealt with church-state
                    affairs, and he didn't give me an answer. Then all of a sudden we heard that the
                    funeral was going to take place in the cathedral in Zagreb. This was a big
                    change. The Vatican assigned the cardinal of Vienna to come down and represent
                    the Pope. While he was coming down to the funeral, we were all at the funeral.
                    The cathedral was full, people outside, and all that. And it was delayed. We
                    were wondering why the delay? They said they're waiting for the cardinal from
                    Vienna. He was in an automobile accident. He had his jaw broken in four places
                    and a broken leg. The driver was killed. His secretary was all beat up. So all
                    of a sudden there came a lot of excitement in the church, and then the funeral
                    went ahead, and éeper, who later became a cardinal himself, became the
                    archbishop then, and the cardinal.</p>
                <p>He was called to Rome because of the Vatican Council. While he was in Rome,
                    getting ready for the council, he was in a preparatory commission. He had two
                    nieces, one living in Budapest, and he spoke Hungarian. I know because he spoke
                    Hungarian with my wife. Some people who didn't like him said he was really
                    Hungarian. And he had a niece in Belgrade. Both of them were married to Jews.
                    They both wrote to him and said “Dear Uncle Frank, Please, if you're doing
                    something, think about the Catholic attitude toward Jews. Maybe something can be
                    done.” He said these two nieces were not in touch with each other. They knew of
                    each other, but they really didn't know each other. So, he said, he took that as
                    a sign, and then during the Vatican Council, sure enough, Archbishop - then
                    Cardinal - éeper made a statement about anti-Semitism.</p>
                <p>The story was, the cardinal thought about it, and he said, this is a sign. The
                    statement he made was, “There's no biblical justification for anti-Semitism.”
                    People are anti-Semitic for whatever reason, but they can't say that it's
                    because the Jews killed Christ. It doesn't make sense, when you think about it.
                    No justification for that. The pope we have now has recognized Israel. That
                    started with Cardinal éeper. I'm not saying it wouldn't have happened anyway,
                    but that incident at the Vatican Council was éeper.</p>
                <p>Another thing that happened was very good. We did a lot of end-use checks because
                    we had a lot of specialty petroleum products. At that time, one item that was
                    very sensitive was boron. Remember the boron additive in oil?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>MARTIN: The Yugoslavs ordered 50 tons of boron, which was shipped to them. I got
                    the instruction to do an end-use check. It had happened actually that my
                    predecessor had started it, and he had gotten a nonsense answer. They had told
                    him it was being used for glass, as an additive in glass production. But we knew
                    it could be used as part of dry fuel in rockets. So they told us that 25 tons
                    was used up already in various factories. And I said, “I want to see the other
                    25 tons.” They said it was in a warehouse. Len Weiss, whom I mentioned before,
                    called me up and said, “You know, don't worry if they don't give you permission.
                    You know, nobody expects you to be able to go to that warehouse.” So I said,
                    well, okay, but my boss and I had a great relationship with the guy, and he
                    said, well, give it a try, what have we got to lose? So I said, okay. “I want to
                    see the warehouse.” He said okay. So we went down, and sure enough, there were
                    25 tons, in these like cement bags, of boron. And I counted the bags and I even
                    got up on top of the pile to look at it. They were letting me do this. And
                    people thought I must have had some kind of marvelous relationship with people
                    that they would let me do this. Nobody expected it to happen. One of the bags
                    had broken open, and I took out a scoop. I said, “Can I take some of this
                    stuff.” Sure. So I took a scoop of it and put it in a bag, brought it home, and
                    I had it in a drawer somewhere. And I wrote the report, and I said, “To test
                    their bona fides I asked if I could take a scoop of the stuff, and they said,
                    'Sure, take it.'" Down in Belgrade they couldn't believe what happened.</p>
                <p>I even saw Jules Katz a couple of years later. He looked at me and laughed. He
                    said, “How did you get into that warehouse?” Well, as it turned out, this became
                    the biggest end-use check story of that year, the biggest end-use problem: what
                    about the boron? They finally figured out - maybe they got CIA information -
                    that this was a secret police operation. They believed 25 tons was shipped to
                    the Soviet Union. This generated a lot of dollars, which could be used by the
                    secret police for their operations in the United States. Maybe because we asked
                    about the other stuff, they didn't send it anywhere. I even said to the guy, “Is
                    this used in glass production?” “Yeah, yeah, that's what it's used for - glass
                    production.” Boron is used that way apparently, and we have almost an exclusive
                    supply of boron. Death Valley is full of boron.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's sort of like borax.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Borax is made from boron. Boron is one of the elements, and you have all
                    kinds of things made from it. But at that time it was used for solid fuel for
                    rocket fuel or as stabilizer for rocket fuel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, the Yugoslavs had no rocket program.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>MARTIN: No, and at the same time. So that made me a big hero of end-use checks,
                    but they were conning me, or they thought they were. They really didn't, and we
                    finally got them to admit what really happened - but it took about three years,
                    and Jules Katz was the one - they finally admitted and said they wouldn't do it
                    again. So we let them get away with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In talking to the officials and other people there, did
                        you feel that the Tito government was sitting very heavily on them as far as
                        nationalism and all. I mean, everything was brotherhood and unity. Every
                        bridge was “Boulevards of . . . “ What was it - bractvo i jedinstvo - it
                        means 'brotherhood and unity' and all that. Were you able to look at this
                        and see that this was all just a surface thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Oh, no, that was very important. It was very important because there was
                    a balance which Tito was able to maintain. The Serbs said that he was really a
                    Croat, but he wasn't. But many of those Croats, and I would include him in that
                    category, were really Austro-Hungarian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he served in the Austro-Hungarian army.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: He served in the Austro-Hungarian army, and he got a medal. He was
                    captured and went to Russia; where he became a Communist. Then he came back. I
                    think people said his father was Croatian and his mother was Slovenian. He was
                    raised in Croatia, but he was not a Croatian nationalist. He was a person who
                    had become a Communist and presumably a believing Communist at one time.
                    However, a guy named Franz Borkenau wrote a book called European Communism, and
                    he said that the Russians figured that Tito was a person who had excellent
                    leadership qualities, but couldn't be trusted ideologically. They figured that
                    out early. So they said, we're going to have to send somebody with him to guide
                    him. In the war, the excitement and everything, that didn't happen, and he
                    started to get his own ideas on Communism, which the Soviet Union couldn't
                    accept.</p>
                <p>The Yugoslav ambassador to London at the time of the break was the guy who was my
                    landlord in Croatia, and he was known to British intelligence who told him that
                    if Tito went to the Cominform meeting, he was going to be arrested and tried and
                    executed. The Yugoslav ambassador had it communicated right away to Tito, and
                    Tito didn't go. There had been a lot of trouble up to then, and Stalin was
                    quoted as saying, “I move my little finger, and there'll be no more Tito.” But
                    it didn't happen. But he was sitting on his nationalism with a man named
                    Bakaric, who was an ideologue, and he was the head of the Croatian party. And
                    they used to have articles in these publications all the time that reflected
                    what was going on.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>When I mentioned the Cardinal's funeral, Western analysts said this is a big
                    departure point in attitude towards the Catholic Church, and I think it was, but
                    there had been signs of it earlier. For example, there were articles in
                    publications. They explored the question, if a Communist Party member's mother
                    dies, and she is having a religious funeral, may he attend the funeral? Up until
                    that time he couldn't. Then the article went on, reaching the conclusion, that
                    he can go to the funeral providing the priest was not a fascist. If the priest
                    is an old fascist, he can't go. But if the priest is not so bad, then he can go.
                    They had all kinds of articles like that.</p>
                <p>We also say there was a lot of tension because, if you remember, there was a guy
                    who had written this famous book, and then he got in trouble with Tito. He was a
                    Serb, but he said the whole system was corrupt. The New Class.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Milovan Djilas, right. Well, Milovan Djilas -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Montenegrin, actually.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes, but Serb from Montenegro. They were all Serbs in there as far as I
                    know. That's what we used to say in Zagreb, anyhow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, if you're from Belgrade, you knew he was
                        Montenegrin.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>MARTIN: Anyway, Milovan Djilas had two close friends, colleagues, who were
                    brothers, and one of them wrote a biography of Tito [Tito. (World Affairs:
                    National and International Viewpoints)]. Vladimir Dedijer wrote the biography, a
                    very interesting book to read. His brother was Steve Dedijer, and all these
                    three people were on the outs when we were there. Steve Dedijer had been an
                    American during the war. He was the bodyguard to General Maxwell Taylor and had
                    carried Taylor off the battlefield at one time when he was shot. He was a
                    wonderful guy. He became an atomic or nuclear physicist, the head of the nuclear
                    physics program, such as they had, in Yugoslavia. We used to have end-use checks
                    there too. But by the time we got there, he was on the outs. It was so bad his
                    own wife, who was a Party member, left him and divorced him just because he was
                    in trouble with the Party. Dedijer was a handsome guy. He was interested in
                    Esperanto. There was a communicator in Zagreb who was an Esperanto nut. I
                    remember he said he would not go to a post if they didn't have an Esperanto
                    program or if there wasn't some active Esperantist there. He made contact with
                    Steve Dedijer, and by the time I got there the contact had been passed up to the
                    political officer and the consul general, and Ted Montgomery. We would see him
                    around at parties, and he was a very nice person. He spoke perfect English.</p>
                <p>One time the consul general and I were going down to Belgrade. We went about once
                    a month, on the Brotherhood and Unity highway, a straight-line dangerous road,
                    and he met Steve Dedijer at a party. He said, “We're going,” and Dedijer said,
                    “I want to go.” So we invited Dedijer to come with us. He was in the car with
                    us, and we stopped for coffee somewhere, and there were some Communist Party
                    guys in the place, on the road.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably at Sarmsto Mitovica. I mean, that's about
                        half-way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes. We were there, and these guys said hello to him. He said, “You know,
                    things are changing. Six months ago they wouldn't speak to me. Now at least they
                    acknowledge my presence.” Things were changing then. There was a little bit of a
                    warming up, a little lessening - not a little bit, a lot lessening - of the
                    fanaticism, certainly towards religion and also in general. Ideologically, they
                    were loosening up.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>We used to go once a month to Slovenia. Slovenia was also a very interesting
                    place. The Bishop there had been thrown on the ground and set on fire. He was an
                    interesting character. This guy was definitely a peasant type, and had gone
                    through a lot, but was still around. We knew a lot of newspapermen there.
                    Somebody from Washington used to give us instructions. We used to have a lunch
                    appointment to see someone. We'd know what questions to ask him; they'd be sent
                    to us. Slovenia was quite different from Croatia, less independent-minded but
                    nevertheless very independent at the same time. They were somehow able to appear
                    to be very loyal to Tito; at the same time, they were doing their own thing.
                    Economically they were progressing. And the Croats were more likely to get into
                    trouble politically than the Slovenes. As somebody said, the difference between
                    a Serb, a Croat, and a Slovene - there are a lot of jokes like that - when you
                    tell a Serb to do something, he says “All right,” and the Croat says “Okay” but
                    he complains about it, and the Slovene just does it. That's what they used to
                    say. I don't know whether you remember jokes like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I remember those. I remember those.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: We talked about the Leipzig Fair. There was the Zagreb Fair every year.
                    Our biggest effort economically was to put something on there. Then we had a
                    wonderful way of covering our district. We used to go on a semiannual trip in
                    the spring and the fall. We would go off in the car to Rijeka. We went to Rijeka
                    quite a lot, and then we'd get on a boat, and go down the coast all the way to
                    Dubrovnik. The car would be waiting for us there. We would stop at various
                    places, and talk to Yugoslavs. You'd get enough for a dispatch. I remember we
                    had a report, some guy, Rabb I think it was. There was a file on him that said
                    he looked like Tito. We said, “You know, you look like Tito.” The guy thought
                    that was great, what a compliment it was. He said, “A lot of people say that. Do
                    you really think so?” Then he really opened up on a lot of things. These people
                    were very ready to talk, especially on general international subjects.</p>
                <p>At that time, the political situation coming from Belgrade was beginning to
                    change. It didn't happen until a couple of years later, but at that time they
                    were getting the idea of an independent bloc, of Belgrade, Cairo, and New Delhi.
                    Later on you had the non-aligned movement. That was beginning to shape up then.
                    The Yugoslavs were telling us they had such good relations, a good idea would be
                    for us to give our foreign affairs funds to the Yugoslavs to distribute or to
                    run programs in the non-aligned world. People trusted them, and they could do a
                    good job for us.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>It was a hard life there in Zagreb in the sense that when you went to the market
                    there wasn't much there. A truck came down every month from Germany delivering
                    stuff. They would stop off, but they gave primary consideration to Belgrade. I
                    remember we were looking for a shipment of turkeys on Thanksgiving. They didn't
                    have any turkeys for us. We didn't get anything, but some chicken. We all agreed
                    we liked chicken better than turkey anyway. That was making do. But we used to
                    go out to Rijeka on a weekend, and then go up to Aviano, which has been in the
                    paper lately, a lot. We would go to the PX there and get all kinds of goodies.
                    We would make maybe three or four trips a year there. It's a little tough in the
                    winter, but the winter was also tough in Zagreb, so you'd want to make a trip
                    before and after.</p>
                <p>I don't know whether you were in Belgrade when it happened, but when we were in
                    Zagreb, we stayed in Trieste quite often. Ted Montgomery called it “an escape
                    hatch.” That was our escape hatch. We always stayed in a certain hotel. The Cica
                    di Parenzo. The Belgrade people would never stay there, for some reason.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the case of Artukovic come up quite a bit while you
                        were in Zagreb?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes. People talked about Artukovic a lot because the Pavelic government.
                    They operated concentration camps just like Dachau. It was not a death camp. A
                    lot of people got killed there - Jesirovac. That case is still alive. The wife
                    of the commander just got released by the Croatians. And Artukovic eventually
                    was arrested, and after many, many years, Artukovic was brought to Zagreb. He
                    was over 80 years old and ailing, and the Croats stretched the case out till he
                    died in jail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: The Croatian nationalists didn't think of them so much as fascists.
                    Certainly the present government, this guy Tudjman, ideologically he's not very
                    different from Pavelic. So we were not going to do much to Artukovic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: But Artukovic was marked by the Department of Justice. It took them about
                    20 years before they finally nailed him and brought him to Zagreb, and he beat
                    the hangman by dying. Oh yes, people remembered Artukovic.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>People talked about that time, but I would say that the typical upper-class - and
                    that's the kind you meet in the Foreign Service, at the parties and elsewhere -
                    was very into going way back. In fact, one of them was a Hapsburg. I remember a
                    woman who was a member of the Hapsburg family. And then there was Countess. I
                    forget her name. And then there was a guy somebody had called “The Red Count.”
                    My father-in-law had known him or had met him, because the way they took over,
                    the Yugoslavs didn't really do it right. They jumped in too early, they
                    nationalized things, and later they had to reverse some of it.</p>
                <p>One of the things they did, if you had a nice house, they would take it over, but
                    you could avoid the takeover sometimes through some kind of a legal loophole.
                    The Red Count had turned his house into a museum. He had these upper-class
                    widows and people came. He had an open house because if you run a museum, it's
                    got to be open a certain number of hours. His house was open, like, two until
                    five every Thursday. I and other people from the consulate were invited. You
                    could drop in and sometimes play bridge. The way he made it into a museum, some
                    of these women were given the medals of their deceased husbands, and they were
                    mounted and you could walk around and see the medals from General So-and-so or
                    Lieutenant So-and-so. They did similar things.</p>
                <p>One guy told us that he got an order he was supposed to paint his house. Houses
                    were painted so-called “Hapsburg yellow.” Some of these were wonderful, because
                    Zagreb was not touched during the war. The places were all run down, and one of
                    the Party officials would say you should paint the place. He said, “I'm not
                    going to do it because I don't know if the house is mine. Any day they could
                    come in and say, 'This house is not your house.' They'll show me some kind of a
                    piece of paper and some kind of a paragraph, and it won't be my house anymore,
                    so I won't do it.”</p>
                <p>That explained a lot of what happened in all of Eastern Europe. There was no
                    point maintaining anything. The system itself was concentrated on building
                    things, not maintaining or finishing things. That's why people would move into a
                    half finished apartment; they were supposed to finish it themselves. All the
                    time. Communism was such a failure as a system that it's a wonder it lasted as
                    long as it did. I always thought that one of the things they were doing that
                    made it last was they were using up their capital. I'll give you an example of
                    it. You take over a house that's already there, and then, “Oh, yes, we have
                    housing for so many people.” They were there before. Now it's run down. Some day
                    it won't be there any more if nobody ever paints it.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>The Rockefeller Institute was there from before the war, a medical institute. We
                    had a visit there by a medical team headed by Dr. Paul Dudley White, the heart
                    specialist, because that was one of the first places, and he was one of the ones
                    that noticed the diet in different countries is different, and had different
                    results. Some places they have high blood pressure, and other places they eat
                    rice, and they don't have high blood pressure. They did a lot of studies like
                    that. They were doing a study of fat, because in Croatia, along the Dalmatian
                    coast, the diet is heavy in olive oil, and in Zagreb itself it's heavy in bacon
                    fat and pig fat. So it's animal fat versus vegetable fat. It was a public
                    relations thing by Dr. Paul Dudley White to encourage people to come in and have
                    their blood taken and measure the amount and answer a lot of questions about
                    their diet, because it did appear that there were more heart attacks in Zagreb
                    than in Split. So they were doing studies, and could it be explained by the
                    olive oil versus pig fat or not? I think it was a useful contribution to
                    medicine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice a difference between the outlook. . .
                        .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: On the question of a different attitude between the posts in Zagreb and
                    in Belgrade? Well, it was different. We were very closely associated with
                    Croats. Everywhere we went, we had associations with Croats. We had a Croatian
                    maid, and we had a lot of contact with the people there. We felt that the people
                    in Belgrade, where it was a very large diplomatic corps, that they were more
                    involved with the other diplomats there and with the Ministry of Foreign
                    Affairs. They reflected a Belgrade point of view, which was not exclusively
                    Serbian, but it was mainly Serbian.</p>
                <p>It got stronger later on. You know, Jack Scanlan, later on our ambassador, and
                    also in the breakup of Yugoslavia, when you had Secretary of State Eagleburger -
                    we were the last ones to go along with the breakup of Yugoslavia. That all came
                    from Eagleburger, Scanlan, and those guys with a fixed point of view. They never
                    really got out much. Some did, of course. A guy like Nick Andrews and a guy like
                    Steve Palmer. Get Steve Palmer, he'll tell you. We reflected a Croatian point of
                    view, and to some extent Slovenian, a local point of view, local nationalism,
                    and local events - we were local. And Belgrade was more international
                    affairs.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>Another example of how times were changing when I was there was that the United
                    States army started to buy meat. My predecessor had inspected and proposed four
                    meat plants as places that could produce meat that could be sold to the US army
                    in Germany. It was a way of our helping the Yugoslavs. Two of the plants broke
                    down right away; there were two left in Croatia. When I took over from him, I
                    went to visit those two plants. I went to the Gabrilovic plant, walked in, and
                    they didn't qualify for about three different reasons. We had a guy from the
                    Department of Agriculture who came with us to do the inspection, and as the guy
                    told me the plant is old, but the meat is good. I pointed out to him that there
                    were flies all over the place and this could not meet any kind of a standard.
                    But the Croats at the Sljeme plant made all kinds of changes. The first time we
                    went through we said you don't make it for this reason and this reason and this
                    reason. You've got to bring it up to snuff before we'll look at it again. Later
                    they said, “We've done it.” We went to see it, and they hadn't. They started
                    buying and didn't assign somebody from the army permanently, but they had
                    someone from the army veterinary corps, which is responsible for meat purchase,
                    He would come down and spend three months with us at a time.</p>
                <p>In one interesting consular problem, they were happy down in Belgrade with what
                    we did. This army family was in a hotel with their children, and an Indian
                    assistant commercial attach� made an attack on this little child. He invited him
                    into his room, and the kid ran away, but the family told us about it. I tried to
                    find out about it, and then I sent the report to Belgrade. I said, “We didn't
                    raise it with the government.” I did go to the hotel and ask about it. They said
                    the guy had left for Belgrade. They raised it with the Indians, the Indians
                    denied that it happened, and it died out. But that was a kind of shocking thing.
                    The family thought it had no permanent effect on the kid. It happened very fast.
                    He had made a grab at the kid, and I think tried to get his clothes off</p>
                <p>Another important visit we had showed how times were changing and how Tito was
                    changing also towards the Croats. There was a very famous Croatian-American
                    sculptor Mestrovic. Mestrovic came, and his son worked for the National
                    Geographic. The son made a visit because the National Geographic was doing a
                    story at that time. Then Ivan Mestrovic and his wife came to Zagreb, and he
                    spent a month or so. He got sick, and his wife came in and told us he was not
                    feeling well. He needed orange juice, so my wife gave him some, and we became
                    friendly with him. He was very nice. He was very old at that time. Tito invited
                    him to Mali Losinj on the island of Brioni.</p>
                <p>So he went to Brioni. There was Veliki Brioni and Mali Brioni. Mali Brioni was
                    where Tito's place actually was. People went to a guest house in Big Brioni and
                    when the master was ready to see you, you were invited, got into a boat, and
                    went across. He spent time with Tito. We sent in a report on that. And he said,
                    “We talked like two peasants,” which of course was the way it was.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in Split about a year and a half ago, and they have
                        a Mestrovic museum. Unfortunately, it was closed. It looked like it had been
                        closed for some time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Too bad, because I've been in that museum. His stuff is so real, you
                    could almost reach out and touch it. It's so good. He was just a peasant, and he
                    applied to the Vienna art school, and they said, “Here's a piece of stone. Do
                    something with this and come back.” That was his entry exam. He came back a very
                    short time later with something that was just about perfect. They said come on
                    in. Later on, he went to Syracuse University as the artist in residence. He had
                    been a Croatian nationalist during the war, and they were going to execute him
                    in Zagreb. He could hear the guards talking about the plans and arrangements for
                    the execution, which were changed at the last minute, and he was allowed to
                    leave, or escape. He went to Switzerland. He hated the Swiss because let's say
                    he was tight with money. They tried to extract a lot of money. It was very
                    expensive living in Switzerland. You can buy your way in to Swiss society, but
                    it costs you a lot of money to settle down in Switzerland. He wasn't ready to do
                    that. He came to the United States and went to Syracuse as Artist in Residence
                    and later on to Notre Dame. They built a special building for him. He used to do
                    these big sculptures. His wife made a funny remark, because she was talking
                    about being liked at Notre Dame better than in Syracuse as they had built this
                    big building for him as a museum, and she said, “And now he can do a thing as
                    big as he wants.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They're monumental.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Another person that he knew quite well and who was memorable when I was
                    in Zagreb was the nuncio who later became the archbishop of St. Petersburg. I
                    forget his name, Irish name, of course - but he used to wear his robes - red
                    hat, red everything - very ostentatiously during the time when it was really
                    tough, and they still had a nuncio there. He used to go around in his outfit,
                    and he told an American there that he was being followed. And the American said,
                    “Really, no. They don't follow people around like that any more.” He said, “Yes,
                    they're following me, I'm sure.” The American said, “Well, maybe it's your
                    imagination, because the way you're dressed, people are naturally going to be
                    looking at you.” He said the next day the nuncio came by in front of the
                    consulate, and wore that look and said, “I'm being followed, see. That's the car
                    right there.” Then they believed he was being followed. They were watching him
                    closely. They were very nervous about it, but they were much more relaxed, and
                    the reason they were was because of this guy éeper and the Vatican was following
                    a softer line, and Stepinac was being muzzled as a nationalist.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 22nd of February, 1999. Happy birthday,
                        George Washington. Okay, Doug, you wanted to go back a bit.</hi>

                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>MARTIN: I wanted to make one point about my army service again. I went though my
                    whole basic training, and I was on the way to the Philippine Islands the day the
                    war ended. It ended while we were on the high seas, but V-J Day was September 1.
                    And I mentioned that being an infantry rifleman, the chances of coming through
                    were low at that time because of the invasion of Japan that was planned. My
                    outfit was going to make a feint towards the Island of Shokoku in corps
                    strength. I was in Ninth Corps, I would have been with the one's to go in. They
                    weren't going to land; they were going to turn back and become strategic
                    reserves. What I wanted to say was, thank you, President Truman, for dropping
                    the Atomic bomb. People can say all kinds of things about what he might have
                    done, but what he did, I think, saved my life and maybe 100,000 other lives.</p>
                <p>I want to finish up on Zagreb. One of the most important things I did in Zagreb I
                    forgot to mention. There was a student demonstration while I was there, and it
                    just happened that we were coming back from lunch, and the driver said there's a
                    demonstration going on at the university. I said, “Let's go over there.” We
                    actually saw a demonstration, and we reported the whole thing, and we were the
                    only ones to report it. The other consulates apparently missed it, and it was
                    maybe the most important political event of the early 1960's. That's another
                    example of my reporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the demonstration about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Apparently the demonstration came about because at the university they
                    combined various eating facilities into one great big dining room. Everybody
                    used to complain about the food there, but in three different dining rooms, it
                    was dispersed. When they all got into one dining room, people started to
                    complain, and they demonstrated. These students were marching down the street
                    complaining, and the way the Communists handled it was to bring workers in from
                    the factories to beat up these students and break up the demonstration. And of
                    course, that was a smart move, in a way, if you want to break up a
                    demonstration, because the workers resented the fact that the students seemed to
                    have a good deal. They all were on scholarships. They were going to be somebody,
                    and the poor guy in the factory had a pretty miserable, low-level job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's sort of a typical Communist way of dividing and
                        conquering and using the workers. Well, then, you went to INR in 1960. You
                        were there for about a year.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>MARTIN: I was there for one year, and during that year, all the Eastern European
                    countries were in one office, including Yugoslavia. They would have two people
                    doing political; in our section, my boss did the political stuff, I did the
                    economic. As soon as I arrived, they told me I would have to write a paper as
                    part of the national intelligence survey on trade and finance in Yugoslavia. I
                    spent the first six months reading everything, the radio transcripts, the
                    newspapers, the reports from the field, and then I would write it, because I
                    knew the outline. This was a very strict outline you had to follow, not like
                    writing a book and being creative. It's collecting information in an organized
                    way and then writing it down. I did it successfully.</p>
                <p>They had a tough editorial system. You had to go through some tough editors.
                    Actually I went through it pretty easily. The thing I enjoyed about that job was
                    being an expert on Yugoslavia. I knew all the people on the Desk. They used to
                    call us frequently to get information on what was going on in Yugoslavia but not
                    what's going on so much as who was who, facts. They wanted facts, factoids, and
                    information, and we had it on file. I was the one on economics. I'd become close
                    already with Jules Katz, who was the economic man for Eastern Europe, and I'm
                    still friends with him. I see him once in a while.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the economic situation during
                        1960-61 in Yugoslavia? Was it noticeably different from that of, say,
                        Hungary or Czechoslovakia or Rumania and Bulgaria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes, the Yugoslavs were doing better. There were differences within the
                    republics of Yugoslavia. Slovenia was doing the best, Croatia next, and then
                    Serbia, then the rest of Yugoslavia, which really was underdeveloped. There was
                    a big difference between the republics and the level of economic development.
                    The more advanced were getting better and pulling away from the less-developed
                    republics like Macedonia, Montenegro, and parts of Serbia. This caused problems.
                    The US Government, for example, would buy meat in Yugoslavia. They inspected
                    four plants and only passed. The army was buying a million and a half dollars
                    worth of meat from Croatia, and they were very advanced. They wanted to
                    cooperate with the army. They wanted to know how the army wanted sausage made,
                    and they were going to make the sausage for the army the army way, whereas the
                    other plants in Serbia were not flexible or responsive enough to do that.</p>
                <p>The Zagreb Fair was successful in generating contracts. I found the Croats, and
                    even more, the Slovenes, to be go-ahead kind of people, and they thought of
                    themselves as Westerners. So there were differences, but in general the whole
                    country was getting a little bit better.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>In some respects it wasn't. For example, they had a tourist industry that they
                    were pushing, and it was going very well, but they had a system in Yugoslavia
                    called Workers' Self-Government or Workers' Self-Management. It had some good
                    aspects, but it didn't work very well when it came to a hotel because if you
                    have the waiters and the people who work behind the desk setting policy, they're
                    not going to give the same kind of service as they would when you have a manager
                    making people give good service. They had a case study made, and it was
                    criticized in the press. They identified what was wrong with this worker
                    self-management in that particular case. That was an example, but tourism was
                    gaining, and all the benefit went to Croatia, very little to Slovenia, and just
                    about none to Serbia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the reason is that it's really the coast that we're
                        talking about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes, the Dalmatian coast, which is beautiful, but even there you could
                    see faults. One of the nice things about going to the coast, you would expect,
                    would be to eat fish. But the fish that they were getting out of the Adriatic
                    were mostly being exported to Italy, so you had trouble getting fish even on the
                    Dalmatian coast, which was really strange. But it was a beautiful place, the
                    whole coast. We used to go there every year. We went to the island of Ra. We
                    knew somebody there. Everybody knew somebody on the coast that they could rent
                    something from. It was very historic. Later some people went to Greece, and
                    later on, I said, maybe we should have gone to Greece, at least to look at the
                    place, because Greece is just as nice, and maybe even nicer. But it's hard to
                    beat the Dalmatian coast as a beautiful place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in '61, you left INR. What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Well, one more point about INR, and that was, this “Trade and Finance in
                    Yugoslavia,” this report, I had to write. The Yugoslavs belonged to various
                    international organizations, the OECD and so forth, I think -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The OECD wasn't in existence then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Well, they belonged to some other organization. They promised to give us
                    full data just as all members of international organizations would. But we
                    couldn't get the gold figures out of them. I had everything all set to go; I
                    just needed the gold reserve figure. I was pushing Jules Katz, and he finally
                    told me to forget it, we're not going to get it. They just don't want to give us
                    their gold reserves. I think the Serbs in particular had a thing about gold
                    because during the war they complained and ridiculed General Mihailovich for
                    carrying around his gold reserves on the back of these donkeys. That was the
                    most important thing to him, and they were ridiculing that in the biography of
                    Tito.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>They probably also didn't want to tell us because they had more than we thought
                    they had. They were very good at getting the maximum aid out of us. Some
                    historians say we gave them a billion dollars when we could have gotten away for
                    $500 million. They managed, and they were very clever.</p>
                <p>They could be critical of our system. I remember one said to somebody from the
                    Export-Import Bank, “Why do you have all these different organizations? You have
                    an aid program, and then there's the World Bank, and then there's the UN
                    organizations, and then you have the Export-Import Bank. Why do you have all
                    these different organizations?” The fellow from the Export-Import Bank said,
                    “It's because by having more organizations we get more money. If we concentrated
                    everything in one US Government agency for aid, we'd never get nearly that
                    much.” I think that also applies to the US marines? That is why the marines are
                    very valuable; because those three marine divisions are added onto whatever the
                    army has. They give us more than we would have otherwise.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this in INR or in the European Bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: This was in the Bureau of European Affairs, and I worked on the Berlin
                    Desk and East German economic and financial stuff. Even though we did not
                    recognize the East German government, they still wanted somebody to cover
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is obviously a very interesting time on Berlin.
                        Before we do that, let's talk a bit about East German finances. How did we
                        see East Germany in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>MARTIN: Well, there wasn't much information on East Germany. East Berlin was a
                    mess. They hadn't been able to rebuild. The traditional German industry was
                    concentrated in the Ruhr, but more so in Silesia. It had the optical industry,
                    the publishing industry, the printing, and the chemical industry, which was one
                    of the most important industries there. Those were all concentrated in the East.
                    And they were functioning, but in general, West Germany was pulling way ahead of
                    East Germany, and people always saw the contrast. It was hard to say whether
                    East Germany was getting better, but I think it was. East Germany was estimated
                    to be the 10th largest industrial power in the world at that time. A lot of the
                    advanced equipment that the Russians had, they got from East Germany, so East
                    Germany was a very important place to Russia. As far as the economics of the
                    country were concerned though, it wasn't doing well. Now we know something we
                    didn't realize then: that environmentally it was a disaster, because they were
                    doing nothing at all about protecting the environment. The chemical industry
                    smoke from the stacks generally went to the east. They didn't seem to care. The
                    pollution of the rivers was bad, but somehow they didn't do a thing about
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it complete Soviet control, or were the East Germans
                        able to do more with their industry than others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: East Germany was totally state controlled by the East German leaders,
                    Ulbricht mainly, who were old hard-line Communists from way back and very tight
                    with the Soviet Union. The East Germans were running East Germany for the Soviet
                    Union, very tightly. They were not inclined to be independent in any way. They
                    followed the Party line very, very faithfully. Still, I didn't spend a lot of my
                    time on the East German economy or economic matters. Whenever there was a speech
                    by an East German leader, we always analyzed it, and very often the significance
                    of it was economic. We would write something up and feed it up to the Assistant
                    secretary, but not very often. Once I wrote something that was sent up to the
                    Secretary's office, about some East German economic thing. But in general, I
                    would say we followed the East German economy mainly in the speeches of the
                    leaders.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>A more important part of my job was West Berlin and East Berlin. In West Berlin
                    we had something called the Berlin Stockpile. As a result of the blockade back
                    in '48, there was an Airlift, and a lot of it was coal because the people were
                    freezing. Afterwards there was an analysis of what had been done and how to
                    prevent that in future, or at least to be prepared. So what we stockpiled coal.
                    Coal dealers were authorized to buy huge amounts of coal, borrowing the money
                    from banks and the West German Government would pay the interest. West Berlin
                    was underwritten by the West German Government. They had all kinds of subsidies
                    to encourage people to move to Berlin. People in Berlin having a baby got a
                    bonus. To encourage people to go to Berlin, they would give them a bonus to
                    marry, and for each child they had they would get a certain amount of money.
                    There was public housing. There was all sorts money, including American, but
                    mostly West German money, going to build things in Berlin. We were encouraging
                    that. The Berlin Government had a lot of imagination. They would subsidize
                    people to visit so they could tell the story of Berlin. One thing was to get
                    people over into East Berlin to see this amazing contrast with West Berlin. If
                    there ever was an advertisement against Communism, it was just to visit Berlin
                    and see the two parts of the city, one that was doing well and one that
                    wasn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Doug, I wonder if you could talk about when you arrived at
                        the Desk and the Kennedy Administration had just come in. I've talked to
                        people who were serving in Berlin when Kennedy came in, and I can recall one
                        or two of them expressing a certain disquiet because they were concerned
                        that not just Kennedy but the people around him weren't being tough enough.
                        They felt that we might be a little bit soft on the Berlin situation and
                        give away some of our rights. Did you get that feeling at all when you were
                        on the Desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Oh, yes. I used to attend all the staff meetings in the office, and
                    Martin Hillenbrand, who later became our ambassador to Germany, was the office
                    director. He would report to us what happened in these various meetings, and the
                    1961 meeting in Vienna was a disaster for the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where Kennedy and Khrushchev met.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Kennedy and Khrushchev met, and Khrushchev, apparently, bullied Kennedy,
                    and Kennedy was shaken by it. Khrushchev came away with a very low opinion of
                    Kennedy and a belief, because he was a true believer in Communism, that
                    Communism was on the way. His impression of Kennedy was that he could bulldoze
                    him into any kind of concession he wanted. That meeting may have led eventually
                    to the Cuban Missile Crisis which was really the last phase, according to Floyd
                    Cola, of the Berlin Crisis. The Soviets were getting tougher and tougher, and we
                    were not making concessions, really, but were ready to make them. And in fact, I
                    heard Ambassador Thompson, who was our ambassador in Moscow at the time -</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's Henry Thompson?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Tommy Thompson, they called him. He said that we should negotiate away
                    East Berlin before they take it, and of course, they did take it, and we let
                    them take it, but what could we have done? I mean, we were not going to start a
                    war. So, it was true that the climate was one where, on their side they thought
                    they were up on us, and on our side, we were wondering whether there was
                    something we could do that could somehow mollify them. I don't say we. I don't
                    say me. But in the White House, they had that feeling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you arrived, it's almost like a rather
                        esoteric religion as far as Berlin is concerned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean everything...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: ... was very formalized, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was like a very formalized Kabuki dance almost because of
                        the fear that if you did this, the other side might ask for more. And so you
                        had to be very careful. Were you indoctrinated into this new religion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: I had served in Berlin as a vice-consul, and I used to attend staff
                    meetings so I was very familiar with the Berlin situation. That was why I got
                    over into the Office of German affairs. Martin Hillenbrand knew me very well,
                    and he liked me, so he even said when I came in that they admired what I did as
                    a consular officer, so they took me in. I did know the legal situation, the
                    factual situation, and I knew the people too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you nervous about the new Kennedy
                        Administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: I wasn't nervous, but I saw that they were ready to make concessions, and
                    a lot of people thought that maybe it was time to make concessions. Nobody
                    thought that his point of view was necessarily unreasonable or that he was
                    caving in just because he was afraid. But Kennedy was very nervous because right
                    at the beginning of his administration there had been the invasion of Cuba, a
                    disaster. Then he went to the meeting in Vienna with Khrushchev that also was a
                    disaster. So the atmosphere was very bad at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I recall it, didn't Kennedy come back from Vienna and
                        call up a part of the reserves and talk about putting more troops into
                        Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: No, there were no more troops put in. The 6th Infantry was already in
                    Berlin. But when Kennedy came back, he was very nervous politically. His whole
                    campaign, in 1960, was based on the idea of a missile gap and that we were
                    somehow behind the Russians. The Russians picked up on that and were using it.
                    They tried to give the impression that there was a missile gap. There was none.
                    That was a fake. That was somehow a ploy Kennedy's people had come up with.
                    Maybe they really believed it, but once elected, they saw right away there was
                    no missile gap, because we had extraordinarily good intelligence. Even though
                    later on, the East Germans had agents operating all over West Germany and were
                    doing extremely well against us, I think we were doing well against them
                    too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A certain amount of transparency on both sides, unplanned,
                        inadvertent transparency.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Right. There was a woman named Eleanor Dulles, who was the sister of John
                    Foster Dulles, and I really took over all of what she had been doing. Of course,
                    I didn't do what she was doing. Because of her connections and her name, she had
                    been able to set up something called the Benjamin Franklin Foundation, which
                    built a congress hall in Berlin, and then she was building a medical center. The
                    foundation was headed by an architect who was the head of the American Institute
                    of Architects at one time, a guy named Leon Chatelain. He didn't want Eleanor
                    Dulles pushing him around.</p>
                <p>The first thing that happened was Mrs. Dulles was transferred to something else
                    and resigned very shortly thereafter. But she was still interested. She used to
                    call up, and she could threaten. She would call up and ask a question. If we
                    didn't give her the answer right away, she'd say, well, what if I call my
                    congressman? Then you'd have to write a congressional letter. I mean, she was a
                    little bit indirect, but not very. We would get the point, and anyway, people
                    liked her, taking into account her personality and way of doing things. We liked
                    her, and we liked what she had been doing. But the State Department auditors
                    criticized the foundation. One recommendation which redounded very much to my
                    benefit was they said that whenever the Benjamin Franklin Foundation has a
                    meeting in Germany, somebody from the Desk should go. So that was me and I got
                    four trips to Germany between '61 and '64.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the foundation doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>MARTIN: Encouraging aid to Berlin to build up Berlin as a center, to keep it as
                    the future capital of Germany, which it turned out it is. Somebody told me the
                    Congress Hall has been torn down, and they've built another one that's bigger
                    and better, but still, that was a very advanced architecture, and we were
                    encouraging. The Germans did the same thing. They built a symphony hall which
                    was unbelievably modern. It looked like it was built from the outside in, rather
                    than with the idea of the traditional symphony hall. All kinds of things like
                    that were going on. The Benjamin Franklin Foundation was doing it. But later on,
                    they concentrated on the Berlin Medical Center. They hoped it would be the most
                    advanced medical center in Germany and would take the best of the German
                    tradition in medicine and advance it even further, because the Germans were
                    outstanding in the medical field before the war, up until the time of Hitler,
                    and maybe even after that. It continued to be, I think, the leader in Europe in
                    medicine. We were encouraging that and the Berlin Medical Center was going to be
                    part of that.</p>
                <p>On my trips to Berlin to attend those meetings, I would also go to the mission,
                    and see what was going on. I would go over to East Berlin because I had gone
                    over there in my previous job. I would always go to buy books or do something,
                    just to go over and see it. The people from the Foundation always wanted to go
                    over and see East Berlin, and I would go with them. So those trips to Berlin
                    were really great.</p>
                <p>I can't remember exactly when, but by the fall of '62, they started to close in
                    on Berlin. They started to limit access; there'd be more and more incidents; and
                    finally, they were threatening to take over East Berlin. They came up with this
                    concept that Berlin was resting on East German soil, that West Berlin, and
                    Berlin in General, was in the Soviet Zone, and that this gave them some kind of
                    rights. It was a very technical thing. It took people like Martin Hillenbrand
                    and the legal people to explain over and over again. There was a whole crowd of
                    people who had served in Berlin over the years who were working in the Office of
                    German Affairs, in the CIA, and others who were, I think, trying to enlighten
                    Kennedy as to our rights. He was very nervous.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>I forget exactly what triggered it, but we started something called the Berlin
                    Task Force to deal with the day-to-day threat that Khrushchev would cut Berlin
                    off. We had daily meetings, and Floyd Cola and Martin Hillenbrand would go to
                    the White House, probably two or three times a week and sometimes every day when
                    it really got hot. One thing I got involved in was aviation to Berlin because
                    Pan American Airways got nervous that one of their planes might be shot down. So
                    we started negotiating with them, and part of the plan was to have air force
                    officers fly Pan Am flights into Berlin, because we were determined to keep the
                    access routes open. Then they said, “Well, this causes insurance problems for
                    us.” So they began to negotiate, and they wanted us to agree to accept the
                    liability for whatever might happen to Pan Am. We spent a whole weekend once
                    negotiating with Pan Am and negotiating with a man named Gray. He was a famous
                    pilot and later on the president, under the chairman, of Pan Am, and he was an
                    operations man. I saw in the Pan Am building at the JFK airport at that time,
                    which was at that time Idlewild Airport, they had a museum of the history of Pan
                    Am, and Gray was the captain and pilot of various Pan Am flights across the
                    Atlantic in those flying boats that they had in the very early days. He was an
                    impressive guy. He was also very tough, and he could really put on an act during
                    a negotiation, saying that we accused their pilots of being yellow, being afraid
                    to fly, when we told them we'd have air force pilots fly the Pan Am flights if
                    it came down to that.</p>
                <p>As a member of the Berlin Task Force, we used to have meetings every day up on
                    the Seventh Floor, and they'd be chaired by Floyd Cola, assistant secretary for
                    European Affairs, who later became our ambassador in Moscow. Martin Hillenbrand
                    remained as director of the Office of German Affairs, and he was assistant
                    director of the Berlin Task Force under Floyd Cola. We would discuss every day,
                    and one thing that impressed me very much about Mr. Cola was that he was very
                    attuned to what we call public diplomacy. He was very interested in how things
                    were playing out in the press, and I remember he was getting very upset with
                    Drew Pearson. He'd become almost apoplectic at some of those columns. We were
                    also following that, because you might say a subset of the Berlin Task Force was
                    something called the Berlin Viability Programs. Kennedy was looking for
                    political cover everywhere. So he would be asking people what they thought,
                    important American people, and in particular he brought in General Clay, who was
                    a hero in Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lucius Clay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: General Lucius D. Clay was a relative of Henry Clay and had been a
                    four-star general in World War II and then the head of the whole occupation at
                    the beginning, right after the war. When Eisenhower left, it was General Clay
                    who took over, and the street that the American consulate and the US mission
                    were located on in West Berlin was called Clay-Allee. He was a great hero in
                    West Berlin. They really loved him. He agreed to go to Berlin and stay there
                    during the crisis.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>He was totally different from Kennedy, in the sense that he was, if anything, a
                    hawk. People were worried that he was upping our commitment, because people were
                    thinking that if we had a showdown we would have to make some concessions.
                    General Clay was not likely to do that, and so under him we were exercising all
                    our rights, especially our right to travel in East Berlin, which they were
                    restricting at Checkpoint Charlie. There were a number of incidents at
                    Checkpoint Charlie where they tried to prevent us from exercising our right to
                    go into East Berlin. General Clay, with the assistant chief of mission, Alan
                    Leitner, went down and there were tanks right down there at the East Berlin
                    line, and they went into East Berlin just to show that we had a right to go into
                    East Berlin. We were giving up nothing at that time, once General Clay got
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this crisis - this is in '62 - that Khrushchev was
                        boosting the pressure, it was also scaring the hell out of the East Germans,
                        wasn't it? I mean, they were beginning to really come into West Berlin,
                        weren't they, at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: The number of people going from East Germany into West Berlin or directly
                    into West Germany was between 3,000 and 5,000 a week. When something would
                    happen, that number would go up, closer to 5,000. Then it would come down,
                    closer to 3,000. This had been going on since 1945.</p>
                <p>I mentioned public diplomacy and how Ambassador Cola used to follow what was
                    going on in the press all the time. CBS news had by far the best news coverage
                    on radio and television. They had Dan Schorr, and he was doing a great job. NBC
                    was looking bad, and was desperate to be in the game. It started a theme that we
                    were going to win in Berlin politically and militarily, and we're going to lose
                    because everybody would move out of Berlin to West Germany. That was wrong. But
                    there was a flow, and a lot of people in Berlin were from East Germany. But
                    because of these economic incentives, there also were people moving into West
                    Berlin. Under this Berlin Viability Program that I spoke of, General Clay who
                    was in charge of it wrote a letter to 25 leading companies in the United States
                    asking them to consider establishing an office in West Berlin. They all
                    responded very politely, but there wasn't too much interest in doing that. In
                    fact, it was somewhat the opposite. One of the biggest American companies in
                    West Berlin at that time was Gillette. They were making one billion razor blades
                    a year in Berlin and distributing them throughout Germany. When they heard about
                    the Berlin Viability Program, they came in and said, “We're already there. We
                    would like you to give us tax benefits to stay.” They were threatening that
                    maybe they would leave, because everybody else was leaving, but everybody else
                    wasn't leaving. It was a veiled threat that they might have to reconsider their
                    operation in Berlin. But if they got a tax break, we could help them, and they
                    would stay. We referred them to the Treasury Department. Tax questions are
                    Treasury questions, and they went away. It was kind of shocking to me that an
                    American company would take advantage of the situation. Pan Am was the same way
                    in asking us to subsidize the insurance that they had. They wanted us to cover
                    the liability so that there would be no increased insurance costs on Pan Am.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Business is business.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Business is business, and that's what lobbying is all about. But it still
                    was disillusioning to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel with the Berlin Task Force that Khrushchev
                        really was trying to squeeze us out of West Berlin at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Nobody really believed it would happen, somehow, no. We thought if we did
                    the right thing, we'd get through it, just like they got through the Airlift. As
                    time went on, it became clear that we were going to get through. Then, on August
                    13, 1961, they put up the Berlin Wall. Since I was the Berlin guy at that time,
                    the action copy of all of these telegrams would come to my desk. Somebody told
                    me later that in the National War College they used to use as an example what
                    happened after the Berlin Wall went up, and that the telegrams from the State
                    Department were all marked “No Action Necessary.” Well, that was wrong. It was
                    crazy, because lots of action was taking place. I mean Cola and Hillenbrand were
                    in the White House every day. We were doing things.</p>
                <p>We were preserving the status of Berlin. I remember the telegrams were piling up,
                    all the yellows, and I remember talking to Henry Cox, who was our public affairs
                    guy, and I said, “What are we going to do with all these telegrams?” He said,
                    “NAN them.” Not “No Action” - everybody knew plenty of action was taking place.
                    NAN was “No Action Needed,” or something like that. Then they would get into the
                    archive system. But that was told as a story in the National War College as if,
                    really, the State Department was taking no action at that time. Complete
                    nonsense.</p>
                <p>Funny things were happening as the Wall went up. I was on duty the weekend after
                    the Wall went up. All of a sudden, they closed off a sector, and were moving in
                    huge amounts of materials. We weren't sure what they were going to do at the
                    beginning, but then they started building a wall, and then they built it and
                    built it. It took them months to get it completely built. They started shooting
                    people who tried to go through, because there was a big rush. The first couple
                    of days, when the East Germans realized there's a wall going up, you had the
                    option of leaving before it was finished. So there were a lot going across. Then
                    they started shooting people, and there were some incidents of people being shot
                    right at the sector line. There was one guy who was shot and we couldn't get to
                    help him, and he just lay there and bled to death. So it was very bad, and it
                    was hairy for a while.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>On our side, I never had a feeling that we were going to give up Berlin. Some of
                    the Berliners were nervous, but in general there was no such feeling on the part
                    of us or the British or the French. Our position was clear. We were very
                    legalistic. We knew what our rights were. Everybody associated with that desk
                    and the British, everybody had experience in Berlin. We were exercising our
                    rights, and we weren't going to let them cut back on them, even though in effect
                    there was reduction. There was less going over to East Berlin.</p>
                <p>There was an incident when an American sergeant and one of his friends went over
                    to East Berlin. They had these political comedians doing satires in night clubs.
                    The guy was saying insulting things about the United States, and the sergeant
                    got up and decked him. He got arrested, and that was a big incident. We got the
                    guy out, but then people were arguing that they should be proud of that sergeant
                    for standing up for the US. They did a study at that time because they were
                    afraid to have people going over into East Berlin. They found that the average
                    American soldier in Berlin never went further than one mile from the barracks.
                    In fact, a lot of them would come out of the barracks and go straight across
                    from Andrews Barracks. There was a place called the Golden Sun, a bar, and over
                    it there were rooms. These guys would go over, pick up the girls, go up in the
                    rooms with them. Some of these guys would take 30 days leave and never get more
                    than 100 yards away from the Andrews Barracks. It turned out that we didn't have
                    to worry about the GI's going over into East Berlin much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was an enlisted man in occupied Japan at one point, and
                        believe me, the GI's there didn't go very far. They went to the nearest bar
                        and the nearest brothel. That took care of all their needs, and it was very
                        unusual to get out and around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes. The Korean War was still on, or the aftermath of it. We had a lot of
                    draftees in Berlin. And a lot of these guys who were in college or law school,
                    would get drafted. A lot of them would be sent to Berlin to work in intelligence
                    agencies putting the names of people on cards to be filed somewhere. They would
                    say there were 17 - some said there were nine - different intelligence agencies
                    located in Berlin. These guys were college guys. When they got their annual
                    leave, they would go down to Italy, Switzerland, or France. They did try to
                    travel around. It was a chance to have kind of a junior year abroad in a month.
                    So there was some of that, but the typical soldier did not go very far from the
                    barracks.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>Another incident took place there that was very interesting. CBS' Dan Schorr was
                    running away from this NBC guy, I think he's still with NBC out in Los Angeles.
                    NBC wanted to do something. After the Wall went up, there were some tunnels that
                    were dug, and some refugees escaped through tunnels from East Berlin into West
                    Berlin. NBC did something I thought was really bad. They financed a group in
                    West Berlin to dig a tunnel into East Berlin so that people could come through.
                    They made a TV program called “The Tunnel,” and got an award for it. The guy
                    from NBC stood up on TV and said, “The State Department didn't want us to build
                    this tunnel.” He didn't say not to build. “The State Department didn't want us
                    to do this program. They didn't want the truth to come out, about refugees
                    risking their lives.” The guy went on and on, and I was thinking, what a
                    contemptible thing for a newspaper man to make news. They were making the news
                    so that they could get a big story out of it, and then, of course, they got some
                    kind of a big award. It shows how bad the media can be at times. That stood out
                    in my mind, and I've been anti-NBC ever since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time, prior to the Wall going up, was there
                        any divergence among the three basic powers - France, Britain, and the
                        United States - on Berlin, or from your perspective, were we pretty much in
                        harness?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: From this time, we started very serious planning, and I was working on
                    the Berlin contingency plans. We had a tripartite group and a quadripartite
                    group. The quadripartite group included the West Germans. Everybody was on
                    board; everybody was planning; everybody wanted to do something; but there was a
                    divergence of opinion. The British were very clear that they were a traditional
                    trading power. I don't know how much of their economy is tied up, but a lot of
                    it is. They were very concerned with any kind of counter-measures that would
                    affect trade. They were willing to plan for all kinds of trade counter-measures,
                    but would agree to impose them only at the very brink of war. We called these
                    the “non-military counter-measures.”</p>
                <p>There also were naval counter-measures that we heard about, not non-military, but
                    non-warlike. The British didn't want to do anything that would affect trade. The
                    Germans were in favor of doing some things with the navy. They didn't want
                    things happening right in Germany. They were willing to go along with all kinds
                    of planning, but they did not want plans that would start bombs dropping in
                    Germany. They wanted to plan things through the navy and other non-military
                    counter-measures. One thing they could do, they could shut off all the lights on
                    a ship, sneak up on, say, a Soviet ship, which probably would see it on the
                    radar, but maybe not. They would sneak right up and all of a sudden they would
                    shine very powerful lights to disturb anybody on that ship and shake them up,
                    and let them know that Uncle Sam or John Bull or somebody was there. That was
                    one of the things the navy was going to do.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>If somebody came into this country, we could impose border measures. We had the
                    Immigration and Naturalization people come in to explain that when you enter the
                    United States, they can hold you for 30 minutes, just make you stand there for
                    30 minutes, and they can hold people for so long, and they can question their
                    documentation. They can do all kinds of things that would make it very
                    inconvenient, say, for the Russians, if the Russians caused any trouble and they
                    were trying to come in. We could do a lot of things that were inconveniencing.
                    The planning went on for years because it was very difficult to get people to
                    agree, but there was no disagreement on the idea of doing something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the French?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: The French were always willing to do things, but they didn't much like
                    planning. But they would participate in the plan, and they'd say, okay, we'll do
                    this or we'll do that, and if it comes to it, we'll do this or we'll do that.
                    The planning exercise took a long time, and it was very interesting to see what
                    could be done, if it came down to a showdown, short of war. I thought the naval
                    counter-measures were very interesting, and we could do things at airports. We
                    could do things also with trade, such as export controls. When you start looking
                    at what the United States and the other countries can do, it's a little
                    difficult sometimes to get agreement as to which contingency would trigger which
                    operation - as I say, the British were very reluctant on any kind of trade
                    counter-measures. The French weren't so tough on that. The Germans didn't want
                    things that involved any kind of land action, affecting German territory itself.
                    They wanted things to be done outside and by the other allies.</p>

                <p>MARTIN: The 13th, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this put into effect a lot of the counter-measures, or
                        how did we do this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>MARTIN: No, the counter-measures were all planning. We didn't do anything, but
                    the planning was going on all the time. A lot more people were involved. A White
                    House guy, a prominent lawyer in town, apparently close to Bobby Kennedy came
                    over, and was managing the non-military counter-measures. I remember spending a
                    couple of afternoons changing “will” to “may”, going down everywhere he said
                    “will” do this, we said “may” do that. I know it seems kind of silly, but the
                    idea with the planning was, not just planning, because nothing we planned for
                    ever happened. Nobody planned for the Cuban Missile Crisis. We planned for a lot
                    of other things, but it was planning, and also readiness. Going through the plan
                    for what we could do if this happened, we were then ready, because all these
                    other agencies - the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the army, the
                    navwere all in on the planning; it enabled them to be ready. If something had
                    happened, I would say we were quite ready.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we see the Berlin Wall as a defensive measure because
                        too many East Germans were leaving Germany, or was it considered part of a
                        strategy to take over West Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: No, we didn't think of it as a strategy to take over West Berlin. We saw
                    it as a strategy to stop these three to five thousand people a week that they
                    were losing. Right after the end of the war, they had 17 million people in East
                    Germany. By 1961, 15 years later, they still had 17 million people. And they had
                    picked up a lot of refugees along the way. They had a real problem with their
                    economy and with people, and this hemorrhaging of people that was getting worse.
                    No, it was to keep people in. It was not to keep us out, either, because they
                    didn't keep us out. That's why we had these incidents. They would have liked us
                    to give up exercising our rights, but we wouldn't. We kept on exercising our
                    rights to go into East Berlin. I would say this was really a great period in the
                    United States, where we stood up and did something and it worked out well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In dealing with the Berlin crisis, did we feel that the
                        Soviets were very much both concerned and in charge or was this Ulbricht and
                        his leadership calling the shots?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Oh, this was simply Russia. You hear me say Russians. A lot of people say
                    “the Soviets, the Soviets.” It became the thing to say, but Cola used to use the
                    term the Russians. And of course most in the Soviet Union are ethnically
                    Russians. I would say it was a Russian thing, and part of the historical Russian
                    expansion and the idea of their being a great power. They still want to be a
                    great power. Our policy is to try to tell them, “Forget about your reputation.
                    Start doing something about your country recovering from the disaster that was
                    the breakup.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the Wall went up, did that calm things down?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>MARTIN: It did, yes. And the Wall stayed up for a long time. The flow out of East
                    Germany dropped precipitously. They didn't have 3,000 or 5,000 coming; they were
                    trickling across. They were escaping, jumping off ships, going in boats across
                    to Denmark from East Germany. There were some escape routes that the
                    intelligence people knew about, that they could recommend people to go from East
                    Germany directly into West Germany because these 3,000 to 5,000 people I spoke
                    of, half of them were going directly from East Germany into West Germany. The
                    other half were coming through Berlin, from East Berlin into West Berlin. They'd
                    be processed at refugee centers, and most of them would then be transported into
                    West Germany, but some would stay in West Berlin. There were always these
                    contacts between East Berlin and West Berlin.</p>
                <p>I mentioned this German friend of mine whose father was a doctor who had a lot of
                    patients who lived in East Berlin. He continued to treat them and would write
                    down in his book or whatever that he had treated them and taken care of them;
                    then he would have East German money. He used to buy cloth from his West German
                    money. Then he would go into East Berlin and use his East German money to have
                    suits made from the cloth that he bought in West Berlin. There were still these
                    contacts. They always had contacts between some of the utility people and the
                    fire departments. There was never a complete separation between East and West
                    Berlin. We didn't want that. But the Russians were running the show. The
                    showdown was between the United States and Russia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Cuban Missile Crisis? You were still on the
                        Berlin Desk. Were we watching moves in Berlin, expecting something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Oh, yes. Our intelligence was excellent. I have great respect for the
                    CIA. They knew everything that was going on. The thing is, just because you know
                    somebody is going to take a punch at you, can you stop him? You might not be
                    able to. But we did know a lot. They continued to have very good information
                    coming out of East Germany during that time. I remember at a meeting one time,
                    we had a meeting with the French and British, and Floyd Cola said, “We have
                    information from one of our sources in East Berlin.” It wasn't; but he was
                    putting them off. He was very clever, a very smart guy. And Martin Hillenbrand -
                    those two guys, really outstanding. They were regular Foreign Service officers
                    who came up through the ranks, top-level thinkers and doers, influencing
                    President Kennedy every day. He listened to Cola.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about during the Cuban Missile Crisis? It must have
                        been October of 1962. Were we watching for other moves in Berlin? Was Berlin
                        relatively quiet at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>MARTIN: Berlin was quiet then, yes. There was not a lot going on in Berlin. All
                    of a sudden, according to Floyd Cola, the Cuban Missile Crisis was the last gasp
                    of the crisis in Berlin. Khrushchev saw he wasn't getting anywhere, and putting
                    up the Wall, from a propaganda point of view, was a big defeat for them, because
                    it showed that they had to keep their people as prisoners. People were still
                    escaping right and left. There were still these incidents - some people would
                    try to escape, and there'd be a shooting - but in general, it was very quiet at
                    that time in Berlin.</p>
                <p>Everybody was focused on the speech that Kennedy made where he said that we know
                    that there are missile sites and missiles there. They agreed to take out the
                    missiles they had there, and we agreed to take out the missiles that were in
                    Turkey, which we apparently planned to take out anyway. That was the concession
                    we made. I just heard an analysis of it. Somebody said that Khrushchev and
                    Kennedy were two people caught up in a world crisis and neither one of them was
                    really up to doing it right, but they somehow got through it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Kennedy's trip to Berlin? Were you on the Desk
                        at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Ich bin ein Berliner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Before that we had another famous trip. We were nervous when all of a
                    sudden Vice-President Lyndon B. Johnson said that he was going to go. I'm sure
                    he had the okay from Kennedy. But we went to George C. McGee at that time, who
                    was - and I was his assistant helping him. I was his aide-de-camp helping him
                    get ready to go to Germany. We didn't like the idea of Lyndon B. Johnson going
                    to Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was considered pretty much a loose cannon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: We didn't know what he was going to do. So we went to George C. McGee,
                    who was a Texan, and said, “Maybe you can help us get Lyndon B. Johnson not to
                    go.” He said, “No, I can't do that. That's something I can't do.” He wouldn't do
                    anything. Johnson went, and he saw Adenauer. I didn't go to Berlin on that trip,
                    but Herbie Cox did, and some other people. He said, “We pledge our lives, our
                    fortunes, and our sacred honor for Berlin.” And people were saying he had
                    actually upped our commitment to Berlin, he was so forceful about it. So people
                    were nervous.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>Then later, when Kennedy went to Berlin he said, “Ich bin ein Berliner,” and that
                    was really a triumphant thing for him. But basically, things were calming down
                    at that time, and I think we basically had won, and General Clay was a big
                    influence on it, because Alan Leitner was a very nice person and very capable
                    and all that, but he didn't have the stature. General Clay going over there, and
                    also President Kennedy relied a lot on General Maxwell Taylor, who got an office
                    on the Seventh Floor, just about the same time. Kennedy didn't like just being a
                    leader. He always wanted to have cover, and he was always trying to find it
                    through other people. For example, bringing General Taylor in and General Clay
                    and some other people who came into the government at that time, and of course,
                    his brother, Bobby Kennedy. It was all Kennedy's way of covering himself, and
                    maybe to get advice from a lot of people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feel for the influence of Bobby Kennedy
                        while you were doing this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: No. Once, I remember there was a fellow named Elwood Williams. I don't
                    know if you ever knew Elwood Williams.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he had multiple sclerosis. He was Mr. Germany for
                        years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Right, and actually, I used to take him to the bathroom for a while. I
                    was taking care of him. And we used to have lunch every day together. One day,
                    we had a draft speech because I guess it was Bobby Kennedy would be traveling
                    around the world and making speeches in various places, and he was going to be
                    in Indonesia and make a big speech. We had a draft, I don't know where it came
                    from exactly, but I guess it might have come from PER, but it might have come
                    from the Indonesia Desk. It had to be cleared on the Seventh Floor. So I took
                    Elwood with the speech up to the Seventh Floor, and we got in to see George
                    Ball. There we were, sitting in George Ball's office (he was the undersecretary
                    for political affairs at that time), and he was working on the speech. It was
                    obvious that everybody wanted to get in on the act, and he wanted to get in on
                    things too. He looked at the speech and said, “What's all this crap about
                    Communism?” He didn't like that. He completely rewrote the speech, and we sent
                    it out the way he wanted it. We came down the next day; he redid the speech.</p>
                <p>We were there until midnight, and Elwood's wife used to come to pick him up. She
                    had arrived at about 6 o'clock, and it must have been - well, it wasn't
                    midnight, but it was like 10:30 before we got back to the office. She was so
                    mad. They're both dead now.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>The Pentagon was also writing a speech. The speeches were coming from different
                    places, and eventually the speech that Bobby Kennedy gave in Indonesia was
                    completely different from the speech that George Ball had drafted, and I'm sure
                    it was different from what the Pentagon had written too. They probably got a lot
                    of Bobby Kennedy and whoever worked with him right at that time, in the speech.
                    But that was the only remote contact I had with Bobby Kennedy, although he went
                    to Europe at some point and he and his wife came for a debriefing and we talked
                    to them.</p>
                <p>There were all kinds of people getting into the act then. One big thing we did on
                    the German Desk was handle people coming from Germany to the United States. We
                    set up the program for them, and I learned something there, and Elwood taught me
                    that, the main thing was to get somebody important right away to agree to see
                    whoever it was. I remember the economics minister came over. He saw a lot of
                    important people. And somebody from Berlin, the mayor of Berlin or under-mayor
                    came over, and if we could get somebody important to see him we would use that
                    as kind of an anchor, and we'd call up and say, “Mr. Schmidt is coming over next
                    week, and we're setting up a program for him. He's seeing General Clay on
                    Wednesday at four o'clock. Could you see him on Wednesday morning?”</p>
                <p>That always was a good ploy. That always worked - except with George Ball. He had
                    a woman that was his secretary named Mrs. Hanady. I don't know if you ever heard
                    of her. She was a very strong type. You'd call up, you wouldn't get to George
                    Ball right away, and you'd talk to Mrs. Hanady. We would use this on her: he's
                    seeing so-and-so and so-and-so and so-and-so, and we thought maybe Mr. Ball
                    would like to see him. She would say, “Oh, he's seeing all those other people,
                    Mr. Ball doesn't have to see him.” I thought that was pretty good. She was
                    tough. If Ball wanted to see him, of course, that would be fitted in. She'd
                    probably tell him, but we always left the option open. We had a very strong
                    ambassador to Germany before McGee. He was a Foreign Service officer, a career
                    ambassador, I think. He was very tough and always wanted to be involved in
                    everything. Anyway, he was somebody you couldn't get to see a visitor very
                    easily. People would go to Berlin or to Bonn and never get to see him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about George McGee? How did he operate? What was your
                        impression of George McGee?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>MARTIN: When I became his staff aide, they sent me up to the Seventh Floor, where
                    he had an office. He had been bumped. If you remember, shortly after Kennedy
                    came in, like a year later, there was a reshuffling of the people at the top. He
                    said, “I had all the best people, but I didn't have them in the best places for
                    them.” McGee got pushed out in the shuffle, and Averell Harriman, who was a
                    favorite of Kennedy's, got his job. He had a cubby-hole of an office on the
                    Seventh Floor. They do have one little office up there for somebody extra. McGee
                    was in there, and the administrative officers for that area were trying to get
                    him out, and I was in between. This guy would tell me that all his phone calls
                    and everything are going to have to be billed to GER, and all this kind of stuff
                    that you can go through with an administrative officer sometimes.</p>
                <p>Eventually McGee came down to EUR. No, maybe he didn't. I was the staff aide, and
                    I set up the program for him to see people in the US government, and he wanted
                    to see everybody. So we went to the CIA. I think it was when McCone was the head
                    of the CIA. I went over to the CIA with him. Most of the time, he didn't want me
                    to come in with him.</p>
                <p>He knew a tremendous number of people, and he made phone calls. You know, he was
                    a multimillionaire in the oil business, and he was a figure of importance in
                    Texas, and he owned an estate, I think 5,000 acres out in Northern Virginia. He
                    had gotten to know everybody. When he got into foreign affairs, he had somebody
                    get him a collection of books on foreign affairs. He had 25,000 books on foreign
                    affairs, which now have been given to the Georgetown Foreign Service School.
                    That was his private collection of books when he wanted to have a library of
                    books.</p>
                <p>You could see he really enjoyed it. We went to see everybody. We went to the
                    Pentagon, the CIA, the Department of Commerce. Somebody told me he at one time
                    had ambitions to be Secretary of Commerce. We went to see Paul Volcker, too. He
                    saw anybody who had any connection with Germany. He wanted to see that person
                    before he went to Germany.</p>
                <p>During this time, the budget was coming up. The whole argument about the budget
                    was underway. Congressman Rooney was looking for ways to save money, and he
                    heard about the train. The ambassador in Germany had his own private train, and
                    there was a master sergeant in the army who was the trainmaster. The ambassador
                    used to go to Berlin every month, very often by train, or he could fly, or he
                    could go by car. He liked to go by train because to was exercising our rights.
                    Rooney criticized the train, and we gave the train up as an economy measure that
                    would save one master sergeant's pay and the train. McGee said, “Well, it would
                    have been nice, you know, to go to Berlin by train every month,” as the previous
                    ambassador always did. There was an ambassador's residence in Berlin. He'd stay
                    there weekends, then come back. So the last trip on the train was George C.
                    McGee arriving as ambassador in Germany.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the death of Kennedy in November of '63 and the coming
                        to power of Lyndon Johnson make any change in how we dealt with Berlin? You
                        were there till '64.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: I would say it did not make a great deal of difference. Actually, at the
                    very beginning, the same people stayed in the White House around Johnson, and he
                    was occupied with a lot of other things. He was concerned with the domestic
                    agenda. Things had calmed down. The Berlin Missile Crisis was over, so things
                    were quiet at that time.</p>
                <p>One thing I want to mention concerns Eastern Europe. On the German Desk we had
                    East Germany. All the other Eastern European countries were under the Office of
                    Eastern European Affairs. Inevitably, we used to deal with the Eastern European
                    people a lot, so I got to know them. I knew them from having worked on
                    Yugoslavia as well. Our policy of non-recognition of East Germany came up once
                    because the Soviets were always trying to get around it. They were always trying
                    somehow to trick us into doing something that could be interpreted as
                    recognizing East Germany. Eventually we recognized the government but that was
                    much later. I was on kind of a non-committee. All the countries in the world
                    that we didn't recognize were constantly trying to do things to get
                    international recognition. For example, North Korea, Cuba, North Vietnam -
                    whatever country we didn't recognize - there were a bunch of them.</p>
                <p>They would always try to do things. There was an international organization of
                    people interested in light aviation. That's parachute jumping, blimps, gliders.
                    There is an American Glider Association, an American Parachute Association; and
                    an American Balloon Association. These guys were always trying to promote
                    themselves. The East Germans would find them somehow and would offer to fund
                    some kind of big contest or competition, but of course the East Germans would
                    have to be invited. We would get wind of it and shoot it down. We were shooting
                    down their participation in the Olympics, any kind of thing.</p>
                <p>Chuck Johnson, who was my boss on the Berlin Desk and I used to go to those
                    meetings and try to shoot down East German efforts. Once they sent a note about
                    a plane that had crashed and they tried to inform us in Prague. They sent a
                    note. The ambassador was Outerbridge Horsey, and he opened and read it, and then
                    handed it back to the East Germans. We didn't want him to do that.</p>
                <p>So I had to write a letter, or the Czech desk was going to write. We were going
                    to - not reprimand - but remind Outerbridge Horsey that we didn't recognize East
                    Germany, which of course he knew very well. He thought he had done the right
                    thing by opening the thing and handing it back. He wasn't supposed to open it.
                    He wasn't supposed to accept it at all. I remember writing the letter and taking
                    it around to get cleared. Somebody said, “It's almost like you're praising him.”
                    I said, “We have to be very careful. You know, Outerbridge Horsey is a feisty
                    guy. He'll get upset and he'll come back at us, so we have to be careful. On the
                    other hand, we're going to tell him.”</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>Harold Veda, who was the head of Eastern European affairs, liked the letter. I
                    was coming up for reassignment at that time, and he saw me in the hallway with
                    Elwood Williams coming back from lunch. I had gone to see him and told him I
                    wanted to go over to Eastern Europe. He said, “Would you be willing to do
                    economic work?” I said, “Sure, and I'd like to go to Eastern Europe, any of the
                    countries. I've been to Yugoslavia, so I'd rather go to one of the other Eastern
                    European countries. About two weeks later he saw me, and he said, “Doug, I put
                    you in to go as chief of the economic section in Poland.”</p>
                <p>I later met Outerbridge Horsey, a very impressive guy. Later on he taught at St.
                    Anselm's Abbey. His brother was Benedictine monk in England, I think, and
                    Outerbridge Horsey, when he retired, taught a course in international relations.
                    My son took it, and I used to see what he did. He gave a very, very good course,
                    at a very high intellectual level, and it was during the time McGovern was
                    running for election. Horsey came to the office one day, and he had a McGovern
                    for President button and the kid was shocked. He couldn't believe that Horsey -
                    just the way he conducted himself, the way he talked - would be for
                    McGovern.</p>
                <p>It was because of that letter that I got to go to Warsaw, and I was very happy to
                    do so. I was supposed to study Polish, but there was some kind of an incident
                    where somebody had to be pulled out early, and so they asked me to go early. I
                    went in April, I think, of '64, and I had been scheduled to go in August. Now
                    this was too bad, because I didn't know any Polish at all. I started taking
                    Polish lessons when I got there, and I had studied Serbo-Croatian, so I guess
                    you can be retreaded, but I never really learned Polish very well. I did most
                    everything there in English.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Poland from '64 until when?</hi>
                </p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: The ambassador when I first got there was John Moors Cabot, and about
                    halfway through it was John Gronouski. Two more different people could not exist
                    in the world. One was a domestic politician and I don't think he was ever
                    interested in international affairs at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John A. Gronouski, from Chicago.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: No, Wisconsin. On the other hand, there was John Moors Cabot, who had
                    been in the Foreign Service from the first Foreign Service class in 1924. He had
                    a lot of experience in the Far East. He was a very interesting person in that
                    wherever he had been he had tried to learn the language. He tried to get out and
                    give speeches, and he had been very successful in Northern Europe. I think he
                    had been in Sweden. I know he had been in Finland. He used to go around and give
                    speeches and talk to people in university groups. Since our relations with
                    Poland were pretty good, and we were encouraging the independence of the Eastern
                    European countries, he wanted to do something like that. They really shut him
                    down very early. It's not fair to say he was bitter, but they shut him down, and
                    he didn't retaliate</p>
                <p>The Poles needed wheat at one time. We gave them $500 million in wheat exports
                    under the Title I of PL-480. Title I of PL-480 has to be repaid in dollars. They
                    didn't want to repay it. Title IV didn't have to be repaid in dollars. I forget
                    whether it was Title I or Title IV, but anyway, the provision was they would get
                    $500 million worth of wheat, and we would use the money they would generate in
                    zlotys on agreed projects within, I guess it was 10 years, or they had to repay
                    in dollars. That date was hanging over the Poles, and they were nervous about
                    it. They came up with something that Cabot considered very carefully, but he
                    knew right away he didn't want it. They wanted us to redo the entire Vistula
                    River in a US Army Corps of Engineers project to make the Vistula navigable and
                    potable and environmentally acceptable, all kinds of things that would be done
                    to the Vistula River. It would have used up the whole $500 million in a project
                    of seven or eight years and we'd have nothing to show for it politically.</p>
                <p>At that time the war was going on in Vietnam, and the Polish press was very
                    anti-our position in Vietnam. So this really put a cloud over everything that
                    Cabot was trying to do, - and I really admire Cabot for this - during one of the
                    bombing campaigns... July 4th was coming up - I guess it was July 4th, 1965. We
                    were going to have a July 4th party, and then we got an intelligence report,
                    that the foreign ministry said that nobody was to come to the party. Rather than
                    let them insult us by having a big party and nobody would show up, Cabot said,
                    “For July 4th this year, we're not going to have a traditional big bash. We're
                    going to have a vin d'honneur, where only certain Polish officials - and half of
                    them didn't show - and the chiefs of mission of the diplomatic corps would be
                    invited. They just served little canap�s and champagne and toasted the United
                    States and that was it.</p>
                <p>I really admired Cabot for not letting them insult us. He knew how to do things.
                    He was a diplomat. He had been ambassador to about four different countries. One
                    time, way back in Shanghai there was some kind of a riot, and he went out in the
                    middle of the riot. He was a brave person, courageous, smart, but also stubborn.
                    One thing you had to be very careful about was if he ever made up his mind, it
                    was very difficult to get him to unmake his mind.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>One time he had to, and it upset him a lot. That was when Churchill died. He
                    wanted the embassy to go into mourning, because he reminded us all, Churchill
                    was an honorary American citizen. Because he was an honorary American citizen,
                    we had to honor him just as if he were an ex-President or something. Naturally
                    everybody went along with this at the staff meeting when he said what we were
                    going to do, but then some people talked to our British colleagues, and the
                    British said, “You know, Winnie had a very long and happy active life. He's a
                    figure of history now. There's no need to feel all that sorry, to mourn, to
                    regret his death. We don't see any reason to go into 30-day mourning for him.”
                    It was some guy who was invited to a black-tie function, and Cabot had more or
                    less said you can't go because we're mourning the death of this honorary
                    American citizen. They told him, “Well, the British say they're going, and they
                    don't understand why we're taking this so hard. He said, “You know, I don't
                    know. I don't know what things are coming to. What is this world coming to?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was when he was Vice-President?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Right, when he was Vice-President. Bobby Kennedy wanted to capitalize on
                    the enthusiasm which he knew existed in Eastern Europe, when he was about to run
                    for the United States Senate or maybe President. He made a trip to Warsaw, and
                    Cabot was nervous about this, but he said, I'm a great admirer of the Kennedy
                    family, because we're both from Massachusetts.</p>
                <p>On the first anniversary of Kennedy's death I was in Warsaw. Some people wanted
                    to have a mass, a one year anniversary service, and Cabot said no. He thought
                    that was a bit much. I think his judgment was right. So we didn't have it. But
                    when Bobby Kennedy came over, he really got the Poles very upset, because it was
                    obvious he didn't care about the Polish Government. He was just out to get
                    crowds, and in fact, he was haranguing a crowd outside. Hundreds of Poles would
                    show up from nowhere and cheer Bobby Kennedy while he was talking to them. The
                    Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs got very upset. We had arranged things
                    Kennedy and his wife liked to do. We were going to bring dolls and toys to an
                    orphanage, and invite all the newspaper people for a good photo opportunity. I
                    went on that one. They didn't produce any kids. They didn't produce a photo
                    opportunity for Kennedy to give toys away. They were dying to shut him down a
                    little bit.</p>
                <p>At a dinner, the minister of foreign affairs was very upset. Kennedy arrived
                    about a half hour late. When he came in the deputy minister of foreign affairs
                    took a chair, and said, “Here's a chair, Mr. Kennedy. Why don't you stand on it
                    and make a speech to us?” Kennedy was a little taken aback by that. Then he went
                    with Ambassador Cabot, and stood up on top of the car, and actually crushed the
                    car in. It was one of these Lincolns, with pretty thin roofs. He was standing on
                    it making a speech, and the roof crunched in, and Cabot was inside, hunched
                    up.</p>

                        one, known as Prince Radziwill.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Whatever post I went to, if they needed an ecclesiastical attach�, as the
                    joke goes, I was always it. I had to arrange that we should get a priest ready
                    in case they wanted to go to confession. I talked to this Jesuit priest who was
                    a friend of mine. He was all excited, I think, all ready to do whatever honors
                    were to be done, but of course, they were not interested in that.</p>
                <p>They stayed at the Europejski hotel, which had a guest book. It was the oldest
                    big great hotel in Warsaw, and they had a guest book, which they brought up for
                    the Kennedys to sign. This guest book went back, like, 100 years or 200 years, a
                    very important leather-bound book. All kinds of important people had been guests
                    at the hotel and signed the guest book, like Pilsudski. The Kennedys packed it
                    up and took it with them when they left. We had to get it back, of course, and
                    we did. But it just showed you it was a chaotic experience with them.</p>
                <p>The biggest event while I was in Warsaw was when Gomulka had been in power for
                    quite a long time, and the economy wasn't doing very well. They were coming up
                    on this time when they were going to have to pay us back dollars. It was the
                    thousandth anniversary, the millennium, of Poland. In the meantime, Gronouski
                    had arrived as ambassador. They were planning for this millennium because the
                    date of the founding of the Polish state was also the date of the conversion of
                    Poland to Catholicism. It's through the marriage of a Polish king to a Silesian
                    princess. The state was going to have a huge celebration, and the Church was
                    going to have a huge celebration — competing celebrations.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>When Gronouski arrived, Cabot was hoping for another ambassadorship. He was
                    hoping to go to Chile, but he didn't get it. He went back to be the Department
                    of State representative at the National War College, and then a year or so later
                    he retired. He wanted to have 40 years in the Foreign Service, and I think he
                    just about made it. When we came back, we had dinner at the National War College
                    quarters over in Fort Myer with the Cabots. They were always very nice to
                    us.</p>
                <p>When Gronouski arrived, his wife was afraid of flying, so they came over by ship.
                    And there was a lot of stuff about him, because he had been a member of the
                    cabinet, the postmaster general. He was pushed aside to make room for
                    O'Brien.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Larry O'Brien?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Larry O'Brien, who was a political operator, and Johnson wanted him when
                    he was going to run for President and to make sure he had a postmaster general
                    who could help him politically. He didn't have that much confidence in
                    Gronouski.</p>
                <p>Gronouski had become ambassador almost by a fluke. There was another better
                    candidate who was more Polish, but who didn't have a Polish name, so Gronouski,
                    who was really not conscious of being a Polish-American so much but had a very
                    Polish name, he got the job. Kennedy picked him because it was good politically.
                    Johnson sent Gronouski to be ambassador to Poland but also he wrote a letter. He
                    tried to elevate the job by saying that he wanted to have Gronouski's opinion on
                    a regional policy toward Eastern Europe. So he was making him kind of an
                    ambassador for Eastern Europe, not just Poland. All the other ambassadors,
                    Outerbridge Horsey, but also Elam O'Shaughnessy in Hungary, all took a dim view
                    of this.</p>
                <p>Gronouski had to come by surface. So he went by ship to Paris and by train to
                    Vienna, and then we sent somebody to meet him there because we thought he might
                    need help. He didn't know any foreign language at all, never studied a foreign
                    language, never even studied Latin. We sent an Agency guy out, a friend who
                    spoke Polish fluently. He saw Gronouski was standing there, looking at this
                    absolutely desolate Polish countryside - I mean, snow-covered ground and
                    freezing cold and just desolate - and he looked at it for a little while, and
                    not looking at the guy, just out loud, he said, “Lyndon, you son of a bitch!
                    What have you done to me?”</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>He immediately started trying to learn some Polish, but if you've never studied
                    Polish and you're 50 years old, you're not going to learn much. We had the
                    presentation of credentials, and under the Polish system they have this military
                    tradition and they have a military honor guard out there, they're at order arms,
                    about going to present arms. The ambassador is supposed to say, “I salute you,”
                    in Polish, “I salute you Polish soldiers or something.” It goes something like
                    rzonierz ponoszczi. So when they went to present arms, he said, “Rzonierz . . .
                    “ and he froze. About 30 seconds went by. He had been practicing it so long. And
                    finally it came out, “. . . ponoszczi.” And then the arms came down from order
                    arms to present arms. He was returning their salute.</p>
                <p>He wanted to make a speech in Polish over Voice over America, and he did, but it
                    was done with a tape recorder where he would memorize three words, and he would
                    say those three words and then they shut the machine off. And then they'd
                    practice the next five words. They'd go through the five words. So he made a
                    speech over Voice of America, abut it was a technological feat and an
                    achievement of modern technology; it was not a speech in Polish by somebody who
                    knew any Polish.</p>
                <p>He was trying to do things and also went to the other countries. I went with him,
                    because he was an economist, and he thought economics was very important. On his
                    trip to the other places, it was interesting to see the chiefs of mission in the
                    other countries - Floyd Cola, Elam O'Shaughnessy, and Outerbridge Horsey - and
                    how they handled him. Outerbridge Horsey was very polite to him but wouldn't go
                    out at night. Gronouski was a night owl. He used to like to go to night clubs,
                    and he would stay out till two or three in the morning. He always liked people
                    on the staff to be with him. He also liked to think he was very attuned to the
                    press. He was always trying to get a good press.</p>
                <p>He was trying to make something out of our contacts in Warsaw with the Chinese,
                    because at that time, we had talks every once in a while with the Chinese. When
                    Cabot was there, all we would tell the press was “We met with the Chinese, spoke
                    with them for one hour and two minutes, and we'll be reporting to Washington” -
                    something like that, very non-committal. Gronouski came in, and he started
                    saying, “Well, we had a very productive talk. We gave a frank and fair exchange
                    of views, and it was a good talk.” The Chinese would deny it. They'd come out,
                    “It was not a good talk. We told you what we thought, but it was not a good
                    talk. Why you say good?” Gronouski was a character.</p>
                <p>Another interesting aspect of the job there, the embassy, I think, did very well.
                    Any Foreign Service officer who wanted could sit in on the talks as a scribe.
                    There would be four people on each side. There'd be the ambassador, a counselor,
                    a scribe and an interpreter.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>The guy who did it for us, Al Harding was the Chinese language officer. There was
                    a guy who was political counselor in Stockholm who was a Chinese specialist who
                    would come down for the talks. I volunteered one time. Nobody ever volunteered
                    twice, because you had to write down everything. You had to get a verbatim
                    account. A telegram had to go out that night with the verbatim account being
                    sent in a couple of days later.</p>
                <p>I had bad luck. There was a new Chinese ambassador who was a hard-line kind of a
                    guy. There would be an opening statement on each side and then there'd be talk,
                    points made on each side. It was formalized, and next somebody would propose
                    when the next meeting should take place. Cabot went through his long opening
                    statement, which was already written down, so that was an easy part. Then, they
                    went through all these exchanges of views, and this hard-line Chinese
                    ambassador, who had been talking in a rather hard way, didn't seem to be very
                    polite, said to Cabot, “Now if there's nothing more to say, go ahead and propose
                    a date for the next meeting.” Cabot was supposed to propose a date for the next
                    meeting, but he wasn't going to take that. He said, “As a matter of fact, I do
                    have something more to say. I have something important to tell you.” And then he
                    went right into a repeat of the opening statement, which went on and on and on.
                    He dragged it out, and then the Chinese ambassador had got the sense of what was
                    happening, and then at the end Cabot said, I propose the next meeting for
                    such-and-such a date. He may even have said, “Unless you have something to
                    respond to that, I propose” such and such. Cabot was a diplomat from way, way
                    back, and he was always standing up for the United States on occasions like that
                    in a diplomatic way. He was very careful to take into account another person's
                    feelings, but he was also very sensitive, and he would not let anybody put one
                    over on the United States. Gronouski was completely different, and would get
                    into trouble. I would imagine that people in Washington were saying, “take it
                    easy.”</p>
                <p>On these trips to Eastern Europe Outerbridge Horse was very good, because at that
                    time there was the question of the Czech gold. We had a negotiation with all the
                    Eastern European countries about the amount of money they owed us and how they
                    were going to pay. We were getting 10, 11, 12 cents on the dollar from each
                    country, and that's the way we were negotiating. But the Czechs wanted their
                    gold back, because we were holding the Czech gold in Fort Knox. They initialed
                    an agreement where they would get the gold back, and we would get 11 cents on
                    the dollar. So this agreement, initialed on both sides, was sent to Washington
                    and Prague, just at that time the gold price was freed, and goes shooting up in
                    value.</p>
                <p>The gold that we were going to give them that was originally worth say $10
                    million, was now worth $40 million. In Washington they were saying, “Hey, hey,
                    everything's changed now.” We're not going to give you back the gold until you
                    renegotiate the agreement, because the equities have changed. Things are not as
                    they were when we made the agreement. We would never had initialed the agreement
                    we initialed.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>Outerbridge Horsey felt that this was a betrayal by the United States of an
                    agreement that was negotiated, initialed, and approved on each side, and it was
                    just a matter of formality of signing it. He was upset and told Gronouski about
                    this, and then said, “This is where you can help us, with your position in
                    Washington as a member of the President's Cabinet.” He wanted him to intervene.
                    Gronouski really couldn't have had any influence on it, but he was flattered by
                    Outerbridge Horsey, so he came away liking him.</p>
                <p>We had another incident with Outerbridge Horsey where he was in trouble. IBM was
                    trying to move into Eastern Europe at that time. In Czechoslovakia, Watson, Jr.
                    who was in Paris and the head of IBM in Europe, came with an IBM entourage and
                    made an appointment to see Outerbridge Horsey, at 10 o'clock. Horsey was ready
                    to meet them. At 10:30 there's no Watson, so Horsey left. He wasn't there when
                    they came. Horsey made a point of not being there because they were a half hour
                    late, no excuse, nothing. They were very upset with him. I think they were
                    trying to get him fired because he had insulted Watson. But Watson had insulted
                    him, no apologies or anything. That's the way Horsey was. He also stood, like
                    Cabot, on his position as ambassador.</p>
                <p>Gronouski liked Outerbridge Horsey. In Hungary, with Elam O'Shaughnessy, it was a
                    different thing altogether because Cardinal Mindszenty was in the embassy in
                    Hungary, and Elam O'Shaughnessy was like his guardian. Gronouski wanted to see
                    him. Since Gronouski already had this reputation for talking too much to the
                    press, as soon as we arrived, the minute we had an appointment with Elam
                    O'Shaughnessy, with Herb Kaiser, the political counselor, and me, he said to
                    Gronouski, “I know you want to see the Cardinal, and I've arranged for that, but
                    I can only arrange for you to see him if you agree to say nothing to the press.
                    You have to agree to that because I'm telling you that he's under very tight
                    wraps. You've got to be very, very careful of how we handle the Cardinal. Of
                    course that was true. That was US policy; they wanted to keep him because the
                    Cardinal would always try to use any occasion to put himself out in front and
                    against the government.</p>
                <p>Gronouski was taken aback by that, and a little bit miffed. He was definitely
                    miffed. Then O'Shaughnessy - he was a friend of mine, I liked him because he
                    used to be the DCM in Belgrade - said, “Herb, you two can't see the cardinal.
                    I'm sorry, but you can't. Only the ambassador.” So the ambassador saw him. The
                    press were following Gronouski around at that time, because he was always good
                    for something. They said, “Did you see the cardinal?” He said, “I saw everybody
                    I came to see.” But he kept his agreement with O'Shaughnessy. Washington, I
                    heard later, was trying to get him fired for that.</p>
                <p>Our wives came along too, and then Mrs. Gronouski was afraid to fly back. She
                    flew down, but she was afraid to fly back. My wife went back with her on the
                    train from Budapest to Warsaw. They were always friends. Mary Gronouski was a
                    nice person. My wife and she got along extremely well, just as my wife had
                    gotten along with Mrs. Cabot very well.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>Gronouski did talk to the press. He talked about bridge-building or something,
                    but it worked out all right.</p>
                <p>I mentioned that in Poland it was the thousandth anniversary of the founding of
                    the Polish state, and it was a competing thing between the state and the church.
                    And I don't know if you've ever heard of Our Lady of Czestnowa or
                    Czestochowa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that the Black Madonna?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes, it's a black Madonna. It goes back God knows how long. It's very
                    old, and it's in a church and we couldn't go there because it was in one of
                    those restricted areas. We restricted the Poles from visiting certain places in
                    the US; they restricted us. I had gone around with Zablocki in Poland. They let
                    him go there, and he and I went in. They had a music box when they showed it. It
                    was inside a safe. It must have been 100 years old. And when they open the safe,
                    the thing creaks up, and then there's a hymn that was written just for that.
                    It's very interesting because it's the Black Madonna. It's covered with coal and
                    you can't really see much. But it's in every church in Poland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A picture of it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: A picture of it in every church. They not only have that picture, which
                    they wouldn't transport around, but they had the first copy, which is special.
                    That went around Poland to every diocese in Poland and at opening ceremonies
                    Gomulka gave a speech, and naturally they brought in a whole crowd of people to
                    listen to him, but Gomulka had a habit like a lot of Communists of droning on,
                    droning and droning and droning on. As he was doing that, people started to walk
                    out on him, and the press reported this, and it was really a big shame.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Doug, before we finish up this Polish portion, could you
                        talk a bit about the Polish economy during the '64-67 period as we were
                        seeing it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: The Polish economy seemed to be doing badly. Naturally, the Communist
                    system doesn't work well in running an economy. They couldn't get people to
                    work. And the factories were very inefficient. They tried to improve
                    productivity. They were always announcing they'd improved productivity this
                    amount and that amount, but really, they were having a lot of trouble.
                    Alcoholism was a huge problem. You would see people drunk going to work in the
                    morning. In factories it was another big problem. The Poles, although they are
                    very devout Catholics, have no compunction about stealing something if they can
                    get their hands on it, especially if it's in another village or if it's in a
                    factory run by the Communists. There was a saying that the Poles had, “They
                    make-believe they pay us, and we make-believe we work.”</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>The Polish economy was really staggering along; it was not doing very well at
                    all, and this probably was the cause for Gomulka being pushed out. That was just
                    about when I was leaving. The man who came in to replace him was named Gierek.
                    Gierek was the leader in Silesia, which was one part of the economy that was
                    doing well. The Polish coal mining industry was functioning, because they needed
                    coal for the big steel factory that they had built down near Krakow. I visited a
                    coal mine one time. I think some of the big support for the Communists came from
                    coal miners before the war who were members of the union, and the unions had
                    been taken over by Communists. The higher-paid workers in Poland were coal
                    miners. They were always favored, and I think their production was high. So
                    Gierek, who was the head of that area, became the prime minister of Poland.
                    Gomulka fled. It was 1968. It was the time of the war between the
                    Israelis...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. The Six-Day War between the Israelis and Nasser's
                        Egypt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Right. And nobody realized it. We knew there were many, many Jews in the
                    government in Poland, but I don't think we realized how many there were. There
                    were jokes going around at that time because the population was very much in
                    favor of the Israelis and very happy to see the Russians who supported Egypt
                    taking a beating. There were jokes going around that somebody told the Russian
                    leader, “You've got to stop shipping arms to Egypt.” He's surprised at that, and
                    they say, “via Israel.” Or Israel via Egypt. There was another joke then, “Are
                    you on the side of the minister or the vice-minister?” because the vice-minister
                    of foreign affairs, the vice-minister of foreign trade - a number of
                    vice-ministers were Jewish. The ministers were not. Because everybody was in
                    favor of Israel at that time, Gomulka was humiliated by that. Gierek came in,
                    from that area of the coal miners where there was a lot of anti-Semitism. They
                    started what amounted to a pogrom. The vice-minister of foreign trade, the head
                    of the North American section, which included Canada and the US, of the Ministry
                    of Foreign Trade; and the American Desk officer in the Ministry of Foreign
                    Trade, were all Jewish. The vice-minister was retired, and the other two
                    emigrated. They were refugees. One of them went to Sweden; the other to England.
                    On the one hand, people were very happy about what happened in the Six-Day War;
                    but the reaction against the Jews was rather dramatic, really bad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, anti-Semitism has always been quite strong in
                        Poland. I had just left Yugoslavia at that time, and the Yugoslavs were also
                        having fun because the leader of Israeli armed forces was of Yugoslav
                        origin, and they took great pride in this, although Tito's r�gime was
                        supporting Nasser.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: The people in Eastern Europe were very much in favor of Israel, and the
                    Communists were very embarrassed by the whole thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>But to finish up on the millennium, throughout the year, the government was
                    trying to celebrate from the state's point of view, and the Church was
                    celebrating from the Church's point of view, and it was a big victory for the
                    Church over the state. It was very embarrassing for Gomulka, and that also
                    contributed to his demise as prime minister. I attended a couple of ceremonies
                    in Warsaw. These Communists would get in front of a procession, and they would
                    block it. I saw them locking arms and holding people from going into the church.
                    And the Church had these guys with blue berets on who were like their police,
                    patrolling like ushers. The leader of the Church group was trying to shame them:
                    “Do you refuse to let this old lady go into church?” The whole thing was, I
                    think, in the end a big defeat for the state. The whole celebration turned out
                    to be a disaster.</p>
                <p>One of the worst disasters was when they stole a picture. They stole the number
                    one image, and they only got it back three weeks later, in order to shut down a
                    couple of other celebrations that had been planned. The devotion to Our Lady of
                    Czestochowa in Poland, is unbelievable. In fact, we left Poland one day, and the
                    next day was a Sunday. The Polish maid used to take my youngest daughter around.
                    She was an old woman and used to take her to church all the time and was always
                    telling her stories. When we got to church at St. Matthew's Cathedral, my
                    daughter was looking all around the church and said to my wife, “Gde matke
                    boszke czestochowe?” [Where is Our Lady of Czestochowa]? She couldn't understand
                    it.</p>
                <p>It was a big defeat, and suggested that eventually if there were a Polish pope,
                    it would not really be all that much of a surprise. If there wasn't going to be
                    another Italian pope, it was very logical that there should be a Polish pope. In
                    the church-state debate that was going on, the Communists were always
                    criticizing the Polish church for being outmoded, too conservative, and behind
                    the times. That resonated in Western Europe, and maybe in the United States too.
                    It was an effective propaganda ploy, but within Poland, everybody loved Cardinal
                    Wyszynski, and there was some fallout of the persecution, but not much.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '67.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: When I was leaving Warsaw, since I did have connections in the Office of
                    German Affairs, friends there, somebody offered me the job - it was through
                    Elwood Williams, I'm sure - the job as economic officer in Stuttgart. Frankly,
                    that would have been a real comedown from being chief of the Economic Section at
                    the embassy in Warsaw.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: So I turned it down. In turning it down, I said, “Look, send me anywhere
                    you want, but not Stuttgart. Please, let me out of that.” The next thing, I got
                    a letter telling me I was going to go to Vientiane, Laos, and I would be the
                    economic officer at the embassy. That was something of a fiction, because in
                    Laos at that time, the second largest employer was the AID mission, with
                    something like 5,000 people working there. They had one Foreign Service officer,
                    State Department, there, and I was it. I was the deputy in the Program Office,
                    in charge of something called the Economic Stabilization Program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '67 to -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: - to '70.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '70, okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: The Economic Stabilization Program had been a three-part program some
                    years before I got there. There were direct grants. Really, they would pay the
                    officials in the Vientiane Government to send family members for medical care in
                    Thailand and even to Paris and direct grants to support embassies. Laos was such
                    a poor country, it could not afford to have embassies in countries where they
                    were really needed, such as Thailand, Paris, London, and the UN in New York, and
                    Washington. We were providing the money for that. That was the first part of the
                    three-part program.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>The second part was something called the Commodity Import Program, where we
                    subsidized the import of American products, particularly vehicles. They would be
                    sold to the Lao. That didn't work out because there was a lot of corruption in
                    the government, and, though we kept tightening the Commodity Import Program up,
                    somehow they would get around it. For example, they imported luxury vehicles,
                    and we said no more of that, no more automobiles could come in. So they started
                    importing trucks, but the trucks were really being used as household vehicles,
                    and they were the most luxurious pickup trucks you could get.</p>
                <p>The third part of the Economic Stabilization Program was the one that occupied me
                    full time. It was something called the Foreign Exchange Operations Fund, which
                    we called FEOF. It consisted of five contributing countries: the United States,
                    which was by far the major contributor, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan,
                    and France. France's contribution was fake because they used it as a means for
                    cashing francs into Lao currency, which is called the kip, the Lao kip. But the
                    other countries really made a contribution, and they also generated kip, but it
                    was used to pay down the national debt. So basically, every year there'd be a
                    budget deficit, and FEOF was subsidizing the budget deficit just about
                    completely. There were four local banks which would accept kip in return for
                    dollars at a fixed exchange rate, 500 kip to one dollar. That program was always
                    under the scrutiny of the Treasury Department. They didn't like it. First of
                    all, our share of FEOF was high. It started out at about 50 percent and
                    gradually crept up until when I got there it was about 75 percent. Since the
                    French basically used it as a way of changing their money, they did not make any
                    net contribution at all, but they had a chance then to participate with us in
                    negotiations with the Lao Government to try to control the deficit. Basically,
                    in return for their agreeing to limit the deficit to a certain amount, which was
                    really the amount that the government was costing them, we would agree to put in
                    the equivalent in dollars. We would have meetings monthly to discuss progress to
                    see how they were doing so that the deficit wouldn't get out of hand. It was a
                    successful program. By the time I got there, the US was putting in $10 million,
                    but it was also seen as a way for a Lao with kip to go and get dollars and send
                    them to an account in the West. So the capital flow outwards was something the
                    Treasury Department was concerned with.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>I also did the general economic reporting, and a couple of things were important.
                    The ambassador when I got there was Bill Sullivan. I guess he's my favorite
                    ambassador. He has a great sense of humor and is also tremendously capable and a
                    brilliant writer. He was very interested in keeping the war in Laos as quiet as
                    possible, because we were, including CIA, underwriting the Meo tribes. They were
                    called “the sky people,” because they live up on top of the mountains. Today
                    they're known as Hmong in the United States and apparently have not adapted very
                    well in this country. Their leader was General Vang Pao, who had been a sergeant
                    in the French army and was actually a brilliant commander and revered by his
                    people as they would a king. One of my most interesting days in Laos was to go
                    and visit General Vang Pao's headquarters, which was near a refugee camp that
                    USAID was operating up in that northern part of the country. I sat on his
                    tremendous porch as we were waiting to see him, and Meo people were also sitting
                    around waiting to see him. He would come out like a medieval king and mediate
                    disputes, handle questions, advise people, like a wise king who was loved by his
                    people.</p>
                <p>That program was generating a lot of refugees, so USAID had a big refugee
                    program. Ambassador Sullivan wanted to control any planes going up there. I used
                    to write an annual aviation report, and I had to get the name of every plane in
                    the country, and the number, and who was running it. There were all kinds of
                    funny airlines there. There were airline companies that had no planes, and there
                    were planes you wondered what airline company was running. A New York Times
                    stringer and a New York Times reporter, Edward David Binder, did get up there to
                    the battlefield and learned quite a lot and wrote a book called The Secret War
                    in Laos. He got some kind of a prize for it. But the secret war in Laos did
                    remain a secret for quite a long time, and I think it was pretty much a secret
                    still when I was there.</p>
                <p>That was one part of my economic reporting. Another was gold. There were no
                    restrictions on gold imports into Laos, although all the surrounding countries
                    had restrictions on gold imports. So the gold used to be shipped into Vientiane.
                    A fee had to be paid to the government for that, and then nobody cared where it
                    went. It was obvious it was going to the Chinese communities in the surrounding
                    countries. Those people liked to collect and hold gold.</p>
                <p>But the most important was running the FEOF. Every day, the cashier, a British
                    fellow, whom I'm still friends with, would come in and tell me how much kip was
                    turned in that day, and how many dollars we had sent out. We would have
                    negotiations with the government. We were always afraid of a run on the money,
                    and when we got low, I would send a telegram saying we must have a deposit of a
                    quarter of a million dollars by tomorrow morning or the Western World as we know
                    it will collapse. They always came through with it. I really negotiated with the
                    Australians, Japanese, French, and the British; the British were our closest,
                    you might say, friends on that. The Japanese were sometimes difficult to
                    understand, but I think I learned a lot. It was the first time I was in the Far
                    East since I had been in the army of occupation in Japan for a year.</p>

                <p>On the personal side, my son got kicked out of a Jesuit school in Vienna. I had
                    made a mistake, I think, in leaving him there. He came to us and we wanted to
                    get him into a good school. So when my two years were up, I was happy to leave,
                    but this meant our leaving in an off-cycle period. We were really thrown to the
                    winds at that time, and the East Asian bureau wasn't interested in finding any
                    job for me. But I don't know that they had one that would have been really
                    suitable. So I went back to Washington and there were many, many other people
                    who were over complement. They were offering people the opportunity to serve in
                    the Office of Economic Opportunity, the poverty program. Part of the poverty
                    program was the legal services program, which was to provide legal assistance to
                    poor people, not just in the traditional way of helping a person with a case,
                    but in trying to analyze poverty in the community and come up with legal
                    solutions to the problem as a whole.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Doug, before we get into that, I'd like to go back to Laos
                        for a bit. In the first place, can you describe what was happening in Laos
                        when you were there, the war, the economy, the political situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Okay. Politically there had been a right-wing government, and then there
                    had been a coup, the Kong Lee coup, and when we were there, there was a
                    coalition government headed by Souvanna Phouma, who was the premier. He was a
                    moderate person and was related to the royal family. I think the king was his
                    uncle. He's in the cadet line of the royal family. The minister of Finance, who
                    was the one I dealt with, was named Sesak Na Champassak. Champassak is an area
                    in the southern part of Laos. His uncle was the warlord in southern Laos and the
                    top guy there, but he was kept in line. He was careful. They would have just
                    bounced him out if he had caused trouble. Then in the center, where we were,
                    Chinese merchants were coming in. There were a couple of families that were very
                    powerful within that area. There was not what you would call a central
                    government that extended through the whole country with schools, hospitals, and
                    that sort of thing. People lived in these little villages.</p>
                <p>One reason why we could have an economic program that could underwrite the entire
                    budgetary deficit was because they were a small population - no more than three
                    million people - and because most of that three million people did not live in a
                    money economy. They were people who grew their own rice or caught some fish from
                    the many waters all around there, so they had food. Clothing would just be one
                    piece of clothing. A woman had one dress or two. It wasn't a dress; it was
                    traditional - not a sari either. I forget what they call it. It was just a
                    tubular kind of dress that they wore. And shelter - they could build a house
                    themselves. They were straw houses.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>It was not much of a money economy except in Vientiane, where there were lots of
                    stores that sold everything. It was strange, in that although it was not a money
                    economy basically, anywhere you went in the country, you could get imported beer
                    and sandals. So there was import-export business going on. They produced very
                    little themselves. Our aid program was designed to try to get them going. I know
                    we had for example a tire recapping plant.</p>
                <p>The AID program was engaged mostly in road-building. The theory of economic
                    development that was being followed or approved in Washington and was the idea
                    of the successive AID directors there, was road development. You build a road,
                    the people will come and the area will be developed. There was a lot of truth in
                    that. We had two kinds of road-building programs going. One was trying to work
                    through the local government, giving them assistance in building roads. Then we
                    had one big road going from Vientiane, the capital, to Luang Prabang that was
                    being built by American highway construction people from the state of
                    Washington. That road was cut soon after I left, because it was under
                    attack.</p>
                <p>There was danger there. People were being killed. I had a friend, a guy named
                    Parento, six kids, and he was a navy civilian employee in the Office of Naval
                    Construction or something, basically . . . what do they call those guys?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Seabees.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: The Seabees. He was a civilian employee in the Seabee program:
                    construction of the embassy there and other government buildings.</p>
                <p>There was a very, very big CIA operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to him? Was he killed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Parento was killed in an airplane going to look at a school down in the
                    south. He was on the school board, and I was on it with him. The plane crashed.
                    There were lots of plane crashes there. They had all kinds of the so-called
                    “STOL” aircraft, “short take-off and landing.” One kind of airplane was called a
                    Porter. People used to travel all over the place by air, because traveling by
                    land was not safe.</p>
                <p>There were five Frenchmen killed within a couple of miles of Vientiane while I
                    was there. They were out hunting. Some people suspected they might have been
                    doing something else, some kind of intelligence work, but I don't think so. They
                    were out hunting, and two of them were caught by the Pathet Lao, the Communist
                    insurgent group, and were being held. The others came along and stopped to try
                    to help them. All five were then killed in a shootout. I went to the funeral
                    there.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>It was interesting to see the French colons, because that's basically what they
                    were. There were lots of bars and places down on the main street. Lots of the
                    Frenchmen had been veterans of the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, and found themselves
                    in French colonial places and stayed there afterwards. There were bars there. I
                    used to go to a bar on Saturday afternoon to have a beer. The owner was a
                    Frenchman who had been in the French Foreign Legion, had fought in the Battle of
                    Dien Bien Phu and because he had a Lao wife he stayed. There were some
                    Hungarians who had somehow gone from Hungary to Paris, Paris to the French
                    Foreign Legion and the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, and then they stayed. One guy we
                    called J�nos B�csi, Uncle John. He used to regale me with stories of the French
                    Foreign Legion and the Hungarian army and his opinion of the Lao, Hmong, and
                    others. Anyway, he told me that the French Foreign Legion was “Kinderspiel,”
                    child's play, compared with the Hungarian army. He said that was a real army,
                    that was a tough army. We used to love to hear him talk. And there were some
                    others there. My wife is Hungarian. I was in with the Hungarian community, such
                    as it was, all expats and refugees who had somehow found their way there. The
                    woman in charge of the hotel cleaning staff was a Hungarian woman. My wife was
                    friendly with her.</p>
                <p>There was a war going on, there was a war atmosphere, and it was what people had
                    said in the press. It was a CIA-client country. They had a big trail-watching
                    program going on. Besides what was going on in the north, the war down in the
                    south, was where the Ho Chi Minh trail went through. It went right through Laos,
                    cutting out from North Vietnam down through Laos and back over into South
                    Vietnam itself. The CIA ran something called a trail-watching program. A lot of
                    what they were doing I wouldn't know anything about, but I knew that they were
                    watching the trail, because it was only a few miles from Savannakhet and Paksay
                    to the other major cities or towns in Laos. They were on the Mekong River or
                    just a few miles away. One thing I would say about the CIA there, they knew what
                    was going on. They couldn't stop it, couldn't do much about it, but they did
                    know what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the CIA was part of the team, or were
                        they off to one side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: They were definitely part of the team, because Ambassador Sullivan was in
                    charge, and they honored him. But they were so big and so rich, they had so much
                    going, that in effect they were something different. They lived in a separate
                    building. They all had the same title, community development advisor, which was
                    kind of a joke. My kids went to the local American school there and most of
                    their friends, it seemed, were people either from the AID mission or from the
                    CIA. The State Department was definitely overwhelmed or outnumbered. The DCM was
                    State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the DCM, do you remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>MARTIN: The DCM was . . . I'll think of his name in a minute. He was very good
                    and later got into trouble in the Dominican Republic, where he was the
                    ambassador and he had his general services officer was building. . . . Bob . .
                    .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hurwitz?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Bob Hurwitz. I liked him a lot. He was very good and very decisive. To
                    show you one incident that showed his character. He was a good DCM in that he
                    was able to go in and talk sense to the ambassador, because Sullivan could get
                    out on a limb, but he also had a great sense of humor and he realized when he
                    had done it. We used to send in a “weeka.” I used to send in some economic items
                    for the weeka. They were reviewing the reporting in Washington, and said, “Look,
                    just send in separate reports on anything significant. We don't need the weeka
                    any more.” Sullivan blew up. He really got upset at that. He said, “They can't
                    tell me how to report. I'm the ambassador. I'll decide how I'm going to report.
                    If I want to send in a weeka, I will send in a weeka.” And that was it. He
                    proclaimed that at a staff meeting. Apparently after the staff meeting, Hurwitz
                    went in to talk to the ambassador. He said, “You know, this might be a break for
                    us. That weeka is getting to be a pain anyway, and I wonder how valuable it is.
                    They might be right. It's better to send in the more important stuff we report
                    separately. We don't have to send in a silly weeka every week with a lot of
                    little items that are more or less insignificant and meaningless.” Sullivan
                    said, “Well, I guess you're right. I still can write whatever I want, but okay,
                    let's forget the weeka.” That's what I mean by a good DCM. Very few are. Most
                    DCM's are afraid of the ambassador. If you have a strong ambassador, they are
                    supine. They are afraid to say anything because it wouldn't do any good, they
                    think.</p>
                <p>I shouldn't say most - I don't know, I haven't had that many, but it seems to me
                    the DCM gets all the bad jobs like running the school board, the housing, and
                    all those things. He takes a load off the ambassador. But the real contribution
                    he can make is to get the ambassador to head in when he's going wrong, and they
                    don't always do that. I think somehow the training program in Washington that
                    trains DCM's tells them that they have to be the alter ego, that is they act as
                    if they're inside the ambassador doing whatever the ambassador would do in those
                    spots. They should be encouraged to dissent a little bit. When the ambassador
                    needs a talking to, they should be able to talk to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the war at the time you were
                        there? How was it going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Not very well. While I was there, the Tet Offensive took place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was in January, '68, in South Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes, I was in Laos. Tet is a big Vietnamese holiday. Because it was like
                    a very long weekend a number of people came, from the AID mission and from other
                    groups in Vietnam to visit Laos. People wanted to visit other countries while
                    they were there. So we had a number of people who came during the Tet Offensive.
                    While we were there, Khe Sanh was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the siege of Khe Sanh?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes. Near the Vietnamese-Lao border. And people were afraid it was going
                    to turn into another Dien Bien Phu, and we were getting reports every day, and
                    people had maps of Khe Sanh out on the desk looking at what was happening. It
                    was touch and go there. It was getting to look like the war was going to go on
                    forever and we weren't really gaining much.</p>
                <p>General Westmoreland was the commanding general, and I'm pretty sure while I was
                    there he was replaced by General Creighton Abrams. The general feeling was that
                    General Abrams was a much greater man and a greater general than General
                    Westmoreland. As it turned out, General Abrams was the one that really got us
                    out of Vietnam in a way to save the American army. That was what they were
                    trying to do at the end. The military side of it was to get the army out, in a
                    sense to save our military from what could have been a terrible and endless
                    mire, going on and on. I didn't realize that when I went in. I just thought,
                    well, if we did bomb north of the military line, bomb North Vietnam, we could
                    subdue them. I think we could have, but I don't know that it was worth it.</p>
                <p>I went there because my record showed that I knew French, and I could read French
                    very well. I really couldn't speak it very well. One of my accomplishments there
                    was I took French lessons and I did qualify in the French language. My wife, who
                    speaks a number of languages very well, was very friendly with some of the
                    French. There were a lot of French military there, and we were friendly with one
                    family. He was a lieutenant colonel in the French army, and he said, “You know,
                    we couldn't do it, and I don't think you can either, but I wish you luck.” He
                    was right. I think it was just too much for the United States to think we could
                    defeat a Vietnamese insurgent movement that was popular.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>So I would say the war wasn't going very well, but we were holding our own.
                    Ambassador Sullivan used to have meetings on Sunday morning targeting where we
                    would bomb in northern Laos. There was a place in northern Laos where the Meo in
                    a sense were protecting our guys. I think they were employees of Lockheed or
                    something, and they were on top of a mountain, and they were guidance for our
                    bombers coming over Vietnam. Gradually the enemy was closing in on that area,
                    and we were keeping it open, knowing that probably we were going to have to give
                    it up. It was overrun and a number of people were killed but some escaped. I
                    remember Ambassador Sullivan showing me a telegram, and he said, “Well, we
                    stayed at Site 129” - or whatever it was - “a day too long. It was too bad that
                    that happened.” But the place was serving a very important purpose right up
                    until the minute they overran it. Still it would have been better if we could
                    have destroyed the machines that were there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Sullivan the ambassador the whole time you were
                        there?</hi>

                <p>MARTIN: No, no. He was succeeded by Ambassador Godley.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mac Godley.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Mac Godley, who was also very good. I liked him a lot. He's still around.
                    So is Sullivan, for that matter. Ambassador Sullivan lives in Mexico. Ambassador
                    Godley, I would say loved the idea of war. I don't think Sullivan did. Sullivan
                    was having a lot of fun, but I don't think he really loved it. He would have
                    preferred if somehow there could have been a peaceful solution to the thing,
                    whereas Godley really reveled in it. He relied almost completely on the military
                    attach� and the CIA station chief, Ted Shackley. He was very good, too. We were
                    friendly with them because his daughter and mine were in the same class
                    together. The war was not going very well when Godley came in either. Shortly
                    after we left, I read in the paper that the road between Vientiane and Luang
                    Prabang had been cut, and that was a very important event, because the northern
                    part of Laos was being cut off.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>Another friend, who had a Hungarian wife who was very nice, was a pilot in Air
                    America, and he was killed while we were there. He was flying, probably
                    delivering, as he used to say, “We deliver 'hard vegetables,'" meaning, of
                    course, we had rice drops going on all over the place. There were a lot of
                    technological advances being made there. How can you drop a bag of rice from
                    maybe 600 or 800 feet high and not have it smash all over and the rice get
                    scattered? We used to put it in three bags, a bag inside a bag inside a bag, so
                    that when it was shattering, if you were lucky it might have just shattered
                    inside one of those bags. And they were pretty good at it. They had people
                    employed on these planes (this was Air America and Continental Air) as
                    “kickers,” and believe it or not, the plane would drop its tailgate, and the
                    bags of rice would be on it, and the bags would sometimes get stuck, so these
                    guys would be kicking. At the beginning they were just kicking, and a couple of
                    them fell out of the plane and were killed. Pretty dumb, but anyway, it
                    happened. So by the time I got there, they had straps on. They couldn't fall out
                    of the airplane anymore.</p>
                <p>So the rice drops were going on. We had projects going on all over the country.
                    As I said, road building was big. The AID director when I first got there was
                    Joe Mendenhall, and eventually the Lao pushed him out. He went on home leave,
                    and they said they didn't want him to come back because he was death on
                    corruption. He used to brag that our AID program, when we built a school, we
                    brought in all the equipment for the school, all the materials, we purchased it,
                    brought it to the site, and we supervised the school going up. In Vietnam, they
                    would give the money to the Vietnamese and say, “Build a school, and we'll give
                    you the material.” The schools weren't getting built. Schools were getting built
                    in Laos, but the money wasn't going into Lao hands. He had cut out programs for
                    medicines, for example. The Ministry of Health and the Veterinary Ministry -
                    medicines weren't getting to the people; the money was going into the hands of
                    the health officials. And Mendenhall was death on corruption, and I really
                    admired him for that, but he got the local Lao officials very upset with
                    him.</p>
                <p>Next came Charlie Mann, an old-time AID bureaucrat, and he died six months or so
                    ago. He was a road-builder. He liked roads projects. He didn't worry about
                    corruption; he worried about getting along with the government. When I discussed
                    the two AID directors and my judgment about them as to whether they were good or
                    not, I would always point out that Charlie Mann didn't seem to be concerned
                    about corruption. He'd talk about his program. On the other hand, Joe Mendenhall
                    was always aware of corruption and always on the lookout to prevent it, to
                    reduce it to a minimum, to keep a watch out for it. So I used to tell people
                    that the difference between the two AID directors was that Joe Mendenhall was so
                    good he was bad, because resources weren't coming into the country nearly as
                    much as they should have. Charlie Mann was so bad he was good, because there was
                    a lot of waste under him, but there was a need for resources to come into the
                    country, and they were coming in.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>A lot of his favorite projects out in the boondocks got overrun. They would be
                    evaluated as good projects that somehow because of enemy activity got overrun. I
                    would say that Joe Mendenhall was much more aware of political-military stuff
                    and more careful about where the projects got put. Mendenhall's biggest project
                    was to try to get the Lao to grow more rice, because they could easily feed
                    themselves on the rice they were producing. If we could get them to grow two
                    crops of rice a year, which would have been easy if they tried, then they could
                    sell one crop and it would be a good income for the country. The idea was great,
                    but it was very difficult to sell, because the Lao didn't want to grow another
                    crop. They were satisfied with the status quo. It was a very peaceful,
                    wonderful, beautiful country with happy people.</p>
                <p>Basically, even though there was a war going on, the Lao - and of course the Meo
                    were suffering badly - the Lao people were very happy. It didn't seem to bother
                    them whatever their political or religious beliefs, if it was up to them, they
                    were happy. The basic term in the language is, mo pin yan, which means “It
                    doesn't matter.” So whenever anything would happen, they said mo pin yan, it
                    doesn't matter. I remember we had a maid working for us, and her father died.
                    And I said to her when she came back from being away for a couple of weeks, “I'm
                    very sorry to hear that your father died.” She said, “Oh, mo pin yan. It doesn't
                    matter.”</p>
                <p>The Buddhists - in most religions there are apparently two branches, the strict
                    observers and the loose observers, but of the Buddhists the Lao are definitely
                    the loose observers. We lived just 200 yards from a sacred place for the
                    Buddhists. A holy place is a wat, but this was a that. It's like the difference
                    between their cathedral and a chapel. And a that had to have some relic of
                    Buddha. I've forgotten what it was, but they had a relic of the Buddha, a
                    fingernail or a hair or something, in there. And people used to be streaming by.
                    These monks used to go by our house with these saffron robes and begging bowls,
                    and on feast days the maids would put candles out. They would light the whole
                    house up with candles every couple of yards. It was nice. It was a very nice
                    culture, very nice society, and the people were very nice.</p>
                <p>They're coming back now, I guess, but it will always be a backwater. It's a
                    landlocked country, and they were exploited by the Thais while we were there.
                    Anything they shipped through, they were terrible about it. I'm sure, the
                    Vietnamese will also take advantage of them.</p>
                <p>They had a feast every year called the Water Feast. At the beginning of the
                    morning the maid would come around and they would bless us with this equivalent
                    of holy water. They would throw a couple of drops on you. Then you would grab
                    the container and throw a couple of drops back, and before it was over,
                    everybody was tossing buckets over everybody else's head. That was done all
                    over. It was the silliest thing. And they had boat races. It was the first
                    country I ever went to that I really did have culture shock. It took a little
                    getting used to. But once we got used to it, we really did like it, and we left
                    with a certain regret. But because of schools, we got out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You then came back in what, '70?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>MARTIN: '70, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '70, and were with the Office of Economic Opportunity
                        [OEO] for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: I was there from '70 to '71. I was in and out. I'll come to that. Anyway,
                    as I mentioned, because I was a lawyer, they offered me a chance to be in a
                    legal services project in San Francisco, not a practicing but a bureaucratic
                    attorney, supervising grants. But I said no, because I would only be there two
                    years, and I wanted to go somewhere where my son could finish high school. I
                    said, “Poverty Program, yes; San Francisco, no.” So they said okay, and they
                    sent me over to OEO. There were something like 50 foreign service people in the
                    Poverty Program at that time, and when I went there they offered me three jobs.
                    One was state government liaison. Another was disaster planning and support. And
                    the third was in the legal services program itself. I took that. That made me
                    the only Foreign Service officer in the Poverty Program who was not under the
                    control or general supervision of Frank Carlucci. He was the head of the
                    community services side of the Poverty Program, and the legal services program
                    didn't come under him.</p>
                <p>While I was there we were inspected. A woman inspector named Gladys Rogers came
                    over and said to me, “Well, the competition over here isn't as great.” I was
                    doing very well. I had some kind of report that was great. In fact, it was an
                    outstanding report. There were really top flight people working there.</p>
                <p>I was a supervising attorney for the Great Lakes and southwest regions. The Great
                    Lakes region was based in Chicago; the southwest, in Dallas. Their job was to
                    issue grants or supervise the grants issued to these various Legal Aid Societies
                    and their legal services projects in local communities. We were there
                    supervising them. I was basically an inspector. I couldn't go to any places in
                    my region, in southwest or Great Lakes, so I stayed away from Texas and New
                    Mexico and also the Midwest, but I did inspections to see whether projects
                    should be funded for another year in places like Utica, New York, and Boston,
                    San Jos�, California, Portland, Oregon, Monterey, California. It was a lot of
                    fun traveling around the United States and talking with the local community
                    poverty people, because the whole idea was to get poor people involved in the
                    solution of their own poverty. Ultimately, the project was not really
                    successful. The legal services program was bad because they were suing
                    everybody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering, I interviewed Frank Carlucci. He said the
                        Legal Services Program caused a lot of grief for the Department because they
                        put themselves in the position of being opposed to the government, on
                        government pay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Right. It was really, as I say, a new approach.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have trouble getting the lawyers in your area to
                        understand the situation, to be effective but not to challenge to such an
                        extent that they'd blow the whole thing up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: They didn't blow the whole thing up, because there is a legal system, and
                    the legal system does put limits on things, but when you hear about some of the
                    cases they prosecuted, you can't believe it. I inspected a place in Idaho, one
                    of our programs there, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service had a
                    policy that if you turned in an illegal immigrant, there were no questions asked
                    of how you got that information or whether you had participated in the
                    illegality yourself.</p>
                <p>You had migrant laborers in Oregon coming in to work in Idaho. They would take
                    these guys in, and usually a Hispanic guy had the contract with a local farmer
                    that he would provide labor, and they got so much an hour for their work. If
                    they stayed through the harvest, they got extra. So they got like $1.10 an hour,
                    and if they stayed through the harvest, they got $1.50 an hour for all the hours
                    they worked. So what these bastards were doing, it would turn anybody into a
                    radical. What they would do was hire a whole gang of guys, let them work, and
                    when it got close to the harvest, they would call in the Immigration and
                    Naturalization Service and say all those guys in those barracks are illegal
                    aliens. The INS would round them up, put them on a bus, and ship them back to
                    Mexico. I mean, that is thievery, yet, it was legal.</p>
                <p>We were fighting that kind of stuff. They had programs going around the country
                    really protecting poor people from being exploited by farmers in various ways.
                    There were places in the United States where there would be school districts in
                    the state, and some school districts were rich, and some were poor. The taxes in
                    the rich district enabled the school there to be excellent. In the poor
                    neighborhood, the taxes wouldn't cover that and the schools were lousy. There
                    was a lawsuit, and it's now federal law, that goes against that. In a state, the
                    money has to go more or less equally on a per capita basis.</p>
                <p>Another example, if you had moved into a new town to the right side of the river
                    and you called up the phone company, it put a phone in, and you pay your phone
                    bill at the end of the month. But not if you were black. If you went into the
                    black side of town, then you had to pay a deposit before you could get a phone.
                    I'm sure it was true that it was more likely people in that neighborhood didn't
                    pay their phone bill and skipped town. It's unfair to do that in advance without
                    having any experience, so we stopped that. We had lawsuits to prevent that
                    everywhere across the country. We were suing electric companies. We were suing
                    telephone companies and gas companies for just this kind of stuff, which I think
                    is definitely unfair. So the Legal Services Project did a lot of good.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>On the other hand, they did have these crazy lawyers who were out to save the
                    world according to their lights. I had a friend (we still are friends with him),
                    a guy named Jack Cushman, who was three-star general in the United States army,
                    a troop commander in Korea later on. He had just come back from Vietnam. He was
                    there three times, twice at that time, and he was commander of Fort Devens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Outside of Boston.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: When I went to Boston to inspect the program, we always looked at the
                    lawsuits going. They were suing my friend Jack Cushman. Why? Because the lawyer
                    was basically against the draft. He had found this person who didn't meet the
                    standards to be helped by the Legal Services Program in the first place. Because
                    the kid apparently wanted to get out of the draft and the day he was drafted he
                    changed his mind, wanted to get out, and they were representing him and suing
                    the commanding general of Fort Devens. So there were extremists. There were
                    cases going too far.</p>
                <p>A good program can easily go too far. We were suing Vice-President Agnew. We were
                    suing governors all over the place. That's the way you do get change if you
                    accepted the principle that Joe Califano tried to instill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Health, Education and Welfare. But more than that, he was the originator
                    of the whole domestic program under President Johnson. If you accept the
                    premises that something had to be done to help black people, we were doing
                    something.</p>
                <p>Carlucci, of course, was our enemy. The head was Rumsfeld. Carlucci's idea was
                    that the Community Services Program would have the Legal Services Program under
                    it. But we didn't accept that. We could say that the lawyer-client privilege
                    makes it impossible to have us representing people if we are all in one agency.
                    They wanted to have a one-stop system, where you would go to a Community
                    Services project, to get legal assistance if you needed it or to get some
                    medical care at a hospital or something like that. But no, the program was good,
                    and we were independent. Every agency in the government had to have an advisory
                    council. But Terry Lindsner, the head of our program, was a real fighter.
                    Whenever we were in trouble with Rumsfeld and Carlucci at a crisis point he
                    would call for a meeting of the advisory council, which was headed by the man
                    who later investigated President Nixon.</p>

                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>MARTIN: No. The head of our advisory council was the head of the American Bar
                    Association. He would come in and he would give a blessing to whatever Legal
                    Services was doing.</p>
                <p>You asked, was it hard working there? There was one time when it was hard,
                    because the lawyers — this is the 1960's generation — wanted to go on strike!
                    And so I said, “Look, I'm a Foreign Service officer. I'm with you and all that,
                    but I'm not striking.” So I went over to Personnel, and I said, “Look, you may
                    have to pull me out of there because they're about to go on strike.” They never
                    called it a strike; they called it a “sick-in” or something like that. Nobody
                    showed up. At that time a guy came in who was a Republican from Pennsylvania. He
                    had been attorney general, a great guy, Fred Speaker. He had become famous by
                    pulling the electric plug out of the electric chair in Pennsylvania because he
                    was opposed to the death penalty. Still he was also a rather conservative guy,
                    and he would try to get the program channeled only into good things rather than
                    good plus some things that were really rather crazy. Carlucci had a point, but
                    he was wrong overall, I would say.</p>
                <p>The program is still going. It has been trimmed back and back, but it's good
                    because everywhere we went, when we evaluated a program, the bar was in favor of
                    it. They wanted federal money to come in to provide legal assistance for poor
                    people so that they wouldn't have to. For example, say a poor young woman had a
                    baby, and she'd go to apply for welfare. They'd say, “Well, who's the father of
                    the baby?” She knew who the father was. Had she sued him? No, she hadn't. Before
                    you could qualify, in a place like Ohio, you had to go after the father of the
                    child and make him pay. If the bar wasn't supported by federal money employing
                    lawyers to do that, then because the person really needed help, the judge would
                    assign some lawyer in the community to represent this woman to sue in a
                    paternity case and qualify for welfare. So we were doing crazy things but also
                    absolutely necessary things. There was big support, and that's why the program
                    is still going through Republican and Democratic governments, although they try
                    to restrict it as much as they can. The legal services project is a part of the
                    landscape.</p>

                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>MARTIN: I got pulled out of there because there was something going on up in New
                    York. There was an outfit called the Jewish Defense League, run by Rabbi Kahane.
                    He was a right-wing fanatic, and his idea was to cause as much grief to the
                    Russians as possible and to some of the Arab embassies, too, because the
                    Russians were not letting Jews out of Russia. They were always campaigning, “Let
                    my people go.” Eventually there was a threat the Russians were supporting to
                    move the United Nations from New York, which we didn't want to happen. These
                    guys would be demonstrating and throwing themselves in front of cars and the
                    police were bringing them to court and losing. In one case, a guy from our UN
                    Mission went into the court and was writing down the names of the jurors. The
                    guy was not a lawyer and he didn't realize what he was doing. The defense lawyer
                    for this Jewish Defense League group said, “Who is that writing down these
                    names, and what is he doing?” because they suspected that the State Department
                    didn't like what they were doing. The Department said, we've got to get somebody
                    up there who's going to know what he's doing and we don't get the law
                    enforcement community in a public relations bind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one of the problems, I suppose, was that almost any
                        jury would contain some Jews in it, and it would be presented in the same
                        way that a decade earlier if you had a white up against a black opponent,
                        the white would always win with the jury.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Sure. In fact, they would poll the jury, and then they would say, “How
                    did you vote? How did you vote?” We had one occasion where I remember one woman
                    juror said, “I would never under any circumstances find a rabbi guilty of
                    anything. I couldn't do that.” She let herself get on the jury. She should have
                    said something beforehand.</p>
                <p>My job was to go up there and establish liaison with the law enforcement
                    community in New York, since I'm from Brooklyn and I went to Columbia Law School
                    and was a member of the Bar. I was really an ideal candidate.</p>
                <p>I went around. I saw judges, and I saw the US attorney in the Southern District
                    and in the Eastern District - that's Brooklyn, where a lot of the cases took
                    place - and I saw the district attorney, Frank Hogan, a famous district attorney
                    (the court house is named after him), and the district attorney in Brooklyn, a
                    guy who jumped off a building. All these judges, whether they were Jewish or
                    not, and not just the jurors, but the political community, were very nervous
                    about this, because the FBI and the New York City police had arrested something
                    like 500 people. Usually these were college kids or high school kids who were
                    under the control of Rabbi Kahane. He had only a few fanatics that were close to
                    him. They really were fanatics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were dangerous, too. I mean, they were not -</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>MARTIN: They were not fooling around. They had arms. When I first went up there,
                    I went to see the people in the US attorney's office in the Southern District
                    there. The FBI guys were at the meeting, and said, “Look, we know about these
                    500, and those cases are being delayed, postponed, and nothing's happening on
                    them, but we'll keep trying. Those are like mosquito bites. We do have one case
                    going against Rabbi Kahane, and believe us, we're working on it.” So I guess I
                    was up there about two months, and they did make an arrest, and then they had a
                    negotiation with Rabbi Kahane's lawyers, where he agreed that everybody would go
                    free except himself and about five or so of his fanatic supporters.</p>
                <p>Kahane had a paramilitary camp up in the Catskills where he was training these
                    guys in military stuff, to be terrorists. He had dynamite there, stolen from
                    construction sites, and there were some explosions. What I didn't know and I
                    learned later, is that every stick of dynamite in the United States has a number
                    on it, and if it goes off, very often they recover it. That's why they're
                    gathering all the evidence. They're looking for the number on the stick of
                    dynamite or some such number on a pistol so they can trace it. He had 93 sticks
                    of dynamite left out of a cache of about a hundred, and part of the deal was
                    that the dynamite would be turned over to the FBI. It was done in a way that
                    they would take the dynamite to a certain place. The FBI was following them and
                    picked it up. That was part of the agreement, and nobody was going to get any
                    blame. The case came up before Judge Jack B. Weinstein, who is a liberal. He
                    used to teach at Columbia Law School. Right now he won't sentence anybody in a
                    drug case. He won't handle a drug case because he thinks that the mandatory
                    sentencing laws are ridiculous, and I fully agree with him. He was handling that
                    case, and it was all negotiated. They pleaded guilty, and the question was, what
                    kind of supervision will Rabbi Kahane be under because he was going to be
                    sentenced to five years on probation, on good behavior? The question was, can he
                    go to Israel or not? Just at that time, it happened Ambassador Beam was here. I
                    had been reporting because my pitch, wherever I went, was, there's something in
                    diplomacy called reciprocity. Every time Rabbi Kahane's hooligans smash a
                    Russian's car, one of ours gets smashed in Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, the KGB people were breaking our cars and beating up
                        our people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes. They respond but they would not testify. To finish Rabbi Kahane, he
                    pleaded guilty with a few of his people. They were on probation. Ambassador Beam
                    had come to the UN at that time -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Beam had been Moscow.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>MARTIN: He was ambassador to Moscow, and he happened to be in New York for some
                    business, and we had lunch with him. He knew me slightly because he had been in
                    EUR when I was in EUR, very early, during the Hungarian time, and so he knew me
                    by sight. I went up to him, and said, “The question here is, what is the
                    Department's position on Rabbi Kahane going to Israel because he'll be under the
                    supervision of his probation officer, and he's going to ask for permission to go
                    to Israel. They're going to ask what the State Department thinks, and what is
                    our position?” He said, “Let him go. Let him go. Let him go.” I said okay. I
                    conveyed that, but I didn't go to court because they wanted me to do this very
                    quietly. They knew the State Department was trying to do something. They didn't
                    know who or what.</p>
                <p>I got a terrific report out of Charlie Brower, who was the legal advisor in EUR
                    at that time, because I must say myself, it was very successful. They used to
                    have demonstrations right outside the SMUN, the Soviet Mission to the UN, and I
                    had recommended we appeal a case to stop them and we won on appeal. Charlie
                    Brower said to me, “Where did that idea for appealing come from?” I said, “Well,
                    I thought it was a good idea, and I talked to Ambassador Bush, and he said yes,
                    let's do it.” We appealed, and we won.</p>
                <p>I become friendly with the head of security at the Soviet mission to the UN.
                    People said he was a Soviet brigadier general. He was very friendly with me, and
                    I was always talking with him about security and how we could protect them,
                    because the anti-Russians were causing them lots of trouble. A lot of the
                    Russians used to rent places in Rockaway Beach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: It just happened that very often they were owned by Jews, and so they
                    were being harassed. Their cars were being trashed; air being let out of tires,
                    that kind of stuff. We were trying to help them. Another thing they were doing
                    was funny. They would put an ad in the paper for a massage parlor, “Try Olga for
                    a good massage. $10.” which is much cheaper than the usual price. It was a
                    number of the Russian Mission to the UN. The phone would be all jammed up.
                    Another thing they did was to go to a store, like Bloomingdale's because a lot
                    of Russians used to shop at Bloomingdale's. They used to get caught shoplifting
                    there, but that was another problem for our mission at the UN. They would order
                    stuff and have it sent to the Soviet mission. Nobody there had ordered it, so
                    they'd have a whole bunch of packages being delivered and the department store
                    wanted it paid for.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>The telephone problem was serious and the Russians talked to me about it. I
                    called up the telephone company, and they said, “Oh, yes, annoyance calls. Call
                    the annoyance call division. All you have to do is tell them that you're having
                    trouble. The annoyance call division will arrange, if you agree, for the phone
                    to be tapped, and when a call is made, if it's coming from the same district,
                    then we can trace it right away. If it's coming from another district it takes a
                    minute because we have to know what district and in that district we trace it
                    there. But we can do it.” I got the guy from the telephone company to come with
                    me to the Soviet mission. He gave his permission for the telephone company to
                    tap his wire. I went back to the US mission, and by the time I got back there,
                    they were looking for me. The DCM - there were like five ambassadors - the DCM
                    wanted to see me right away, as soon as I came in. And so I went up, and he
                    said, “We just got a message; the DCM at the Soviet mission to the UN is saying,
                    no, they do not give permission to have their phones tapped by the American T
                    &amp; T” or New York Telephone Company. I actually got permission. When I told
                    our security officer this, he got very nervous. He said, “Do you know what
                    you're doing?” I said, “Sure I know what they were doing, and I think that's
                    really great that he gave his okay and that they will do it.</p>
                <p>When that was over, I went back to my job in the Poverty Program, but before we
                    leave that I want to say one thing of a personal nature. When I went up there, I
                    didn't realize it, but it was the last five months of my father's life. I was
                    aware he had cancer at that time. I used to fly up on Monday. I'd get to my
                    office, actually, earlier than I did other days, and then Monday, Tuesday,
                    Wednesday, Thursday nights I would stay with my family in Brooklyn, so I'd be
                    with my father. He would hang on for the day I'd come home, and we'd have a beer
                    together and talk. It was almost providential that I was able to do that, and I
                    really, somehow I appreciated that the Department of State had sent me up there.
                    I thought that was great to be with my father during the last days of his life.
                    When I left there it was his last month.</p>
                <p>I came back for a short time to the Poverty Program. The thing had been a big
                    success up in New York, and the Department was establishing a grievance system.
                    They were worried because a Foreign Service officer had committed suicide after
                    something that should have been in his file didn't get in, and some stuff that
                    shouldn't have been in his file did get in. I think he had been selected out,
                    and he couldn't find a job, and he eventually committed suicide. He had a widow
                    who was also a very dramatic type. She testified before a congressional
                    committee.</p>

                    and Congressman Wayne Hayes. I think she had studied dramatics. She was very
                    effective in her presentation of what happened to her husband, which was a
                    tragedy. Hayes interrupted her and said, “Look, Madam, people lose their jobs
                    every day in this country. That's no reason to commit suicide.” It was something
                    rather shocking to say. On the other hand, he was making a point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, if I recall, John Thomas had been selected out, and
                        it was a year later when he did this, so this was not done under shock or
                        something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: No, that's right. As I result the Department was preparing to create some
                    sort of a grievance system. First they established some ad hoc panels to look at
                    what they considered to be extreme cases, as they thought the Thomas case would
                    have been because it was based on an incorrect record. But that got out of hand
                    almost immediately. These ad hoc panels were recommending that people get
                    promoted and were promoting people. After three or four cases of people getting
                    promoted, the rest of the system got upset. So they set up grievance
                    regulations, and everybody in the Service, more or less, had an opportunity to
                    submit a grievance over anything that had ever happened to them, and there was a
                    certain deadline for that. A lot of grievances were submitted.</p>
                <p>And Earl Ritchie was the director. I worked for Earl Ritchie. There were just the
                    two of us, and at that time they would talk about having an ombudsman in the
                    State Department, and he, Earl Ritchie, was the ombudsman, too. I was the deputy
                    chief of the grievance staff; I was not a deputy ombudsman. There was only one
                    ombudsman. That quickly died, because the grievance staff quickly took over what
                    an ombudsman might do.</p>
                <p>We would get a case, analyze it, and send it up to Bob Brewster, who was the
                    deputy director general (he was later ambassador in Latin America). I had
                    tremendous admiration for him. He was very fair. He would get a file. I would
                    summarize the file and the person's grievance, and Earl Ritchie would okay it.
                    We'd send it up to Brewster, and he would come down approving it. Before it went
                    up a level, it would go to the legal advisor, a guy named Knut Mamborg, who was
                    the legal advisor really for administrative and personnel matters.</p>
                <p>There was a popular opinion among Foreign Service people, that all these
                    soreheads and complainers were coming in with a lot of grievances. I only saw
                    one case in the whole time I was there - I was there about 18 months - that I
                    would call frivolous. Every other case was fair, and some of them were really
                    outrageous.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>Some of them were funny in a way. In one case, a guy was complaining he hadn't
                    been promoted, and that there was a lot of stuff in his file that shouldn't have
                    been. If you looked at his file, you could see what was happening, and Brewster
                    had said we're not going to approve it. At one point, there were these
                    confidential things that an ambassador could adthere could be a two-part
                    efficiency report. Some of it was confidential. It was supposed to be consistent
                    with the other. Well, lots of times it wasn't. Also there were comments about
                    the wife in the efficiency report. In this case the guy's wife was haunting him
                    in the file even though he was divorced from her. When you read the file, you
                    thought, “I'll bet you that's why he didn't get promoted.” You couldn't be sure.
                    The boards are separate but you could just see somebody reading his file and
                    reading a file of somebody else with an equal career - somehow this guy's file
                    didn't look as good, and it was because of this wife. First, she used to dress
                    in a very provocative way. Inspectors, everybody commented that she dressed
                    provocatively. She apparently was flirtatious. She was so flirtatious that when
                    this guy was away on a trip, she came to the attention of the FBI because of
                    people visiting her apartment. We laughed about that, but in that case we really
                    couldn't do very much because the comments about the wife had already been put
                    in.</p>
                <p>Most of the time it was just people not following the regulations about
                    efficiency reports, because the efficiency report requires the supervisor twice
                    during the rating period to have a consultation discussion about the person's
                    performance. If they didn't do that, they would defend themselves, saying, “Oh,
                    I'm his supervisor, I see him every day.” But that's not a discussion of
                    performance. Very often they wouldn't say anything, and then the efficiency
                    report would come around, and they said stuff that they shouldn't have said or
                    they should have brought to the guy's attention, to let the guy do something
                    about it.</p>
                <p>One thing that Bob Brewster decided very early was that we were not going to
                    promote anybody. We would not recommend that anybody get promoted. We would try
                    to do what we could to establish a better record on the person. Usually it meant
                    taking out a one-year report and the person would get an extra year in grade. It
                    didn't really help too much because there was a feeling that maybe the boards,
                    when they saw these blanks (they were supposed to disregard them), would figure
                    that the stuff was taken out for good reason, which was always the case. There
                    was a feeling that maybe this would be hurtful for the rated officer. But we
                    were not going to promote anybody. If anybody got promoted, they got promoted by
                    the Foreign Service Grievance Board, because the staff was the Department of
                    State's opportunity to establish a grievance, but we were not going to promote
                    anybody, even though it might seem unfair that they had not been promoted. They
                    could always appeal to the board, and the board could promote, and in a few
                    cases - not very many - they did promote people. I think the system is a very
                    good system, and that it works.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>We also had some allowances cases and we had people complaining about travel, how
                    they had traveled in a certain way and the Department made them pay. But most of
                    them were about career problems and efficiency report problems. We could help
                    the person by taking the adverse report out, giving them an extra year, but
                    that's all we could do. After a while we could pretty much tell what the board
                    was likely to do. I think that our recommendations stood up. Now the board, when
                    they rated the Department's grievance staff, they didn't rate us formally, but
                    they commented on the Department's reaction to the grievance system. The man had
                    been in charge of the Federal Mediation Board and was a very distinguished labor
                    lawyer, and he was a nice person too. He said, “You know, the Department of
                    State in handling this whole grievance problem had been good losers.” They
                    accepted, and they did things for people.</p>
                <p>Oh, yes, I was surprised at how they handled allowances. We had one case of a
                    fellow who was divorced from his wife, he was overseas, and she was overseas,
                    and he claimed and was getting an education allowance for their child. The
                    education allowance was the equivalent of his alimony payments, and he said he
                    was paying his alimony, and he was getting away with it. It wasn't Paris and
                    Brussels, but just say the kid was living in Brussels with his mother and would
                    come to Paris to visit the father, and the education allowance would be used -
                    as it is ordinarily - to send the kid away to school and come home, and all
                    that. He tried to get the allowance when he went to his next post. The budget
                    and fiscal officer said no. He figured, “I was getting it at the last post. I
                    think I'm justified to get it.” So he put in for it, and it came up, and I went
                    to the allowances people. We talked about it, and the lawyer said, you know,
                    “You're right. He's not entitled to it because he's not the guardian of the
                    child. He's the father, but not the guardian.” That he was using it for alimony
                    was pretty brassy on his part. He got turned down. The board supported us. I
                    said to the allowances people, “This was unjustified. The first time it was
                    unjustified, and the second time he didn't get anything, so are we going to
                    collect from him for that?” They said, no, we'll let it go. They said, the only
                    time the allowances people do anything is if the General Accounting Office
                    questions it. I was surprised at how lenient they were.</p>
                <p>I stayed there until 1973. I was transferred to Vienna, 1973 to '76. In Vienna I
                    was the director of the East-West Trade Center. This was the time of detente,
                    and up until then (and I had done that kind of work when I was in Zagreb and in
                    other places too) we were doing export controls, trying to prevent trade with
                    the East. Now there was a switch. We were trying to promote trade with the East.
                    Trade centers were big with the Department of Commerce, and they were coming up
                    with the idea that there should be more State participation. They shouldn't be
                    exclusively Department of Commerce operated trade centers doing catalogue shows
                    and strictly trade promotion. There should be some State control over it.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>In Moscow it was exclusively State, but in Vienna it was supposed to be a joint
                    effort. My deputy was a Civil Service guy who had been in the Department of
                    Commerce. He was Danish but spoke German and had spent his life doing shows,
                    putting on exhibits, and he would travel in the East, because the Communist
                    countries were big on trade fairs. We would have exhibits at these trade fairs,
                    and he would go a couple of weeks earlier to set it up. We had something called
                    a modular system, which you could put on the back of a truck and go and assemble
                    it and have an exhibit. He was good at that, and in Vienna he set up a system of
                    information and trade promotion to help American companies that wanted to do
                    business with the East. They were encouraged to come to us.</p>
                <p>I had a fellow doing market research on different countries. You can't do market
                    research in the East, but he had a system by which he developed a judgment as to
                    what he believed the market would be by figuring what American exports to the
                    OECD were and that if we had 10 per cent share of the OECD market, we should
                    have a 10 per cent share of the market in Eastern Europe and Moscow. He did a
                    whole lot of stuff on that and came up with a whole lot of information and
                    judgments about what the market for, say, refrigerators would be in Hungary.
                    Some people thought it was kind of silly, but he could produce a lot of paper
                    saying that we have a market for widgets in Russia or the Soviet Union, with
                    $12, 432,000.15. The guy couldn't realize that that's a nonsense number. You can
                    come up with something that's ballpark, but the way he did it, he would come up
                    with a precise number, and then he would stick with it.</p>
                <p>I stayed there for three years. My wife's mother was born in Vienna. Her family
                    owned a villa, which was about five blocks away from where we lived in the 13th
                    District, which is Issing, the classical residential district in Vienna,
                    equivalent to the 16th arrondissement in Paris. If you didn't live right down by
                    the Hofburg, the 13th was where to live. Most Americans lived in the 18th or
                    19th Districts, which was where the American School was. People didn't want to
                    live in the 13th District, although the ambassador lived there and we had one
                    other villa there. We had basically two apartments, because nobody wanted to
                    live in the downstairs. There was a basement apartment and a first-floor
                    apartment, and so we had, really, two apartments. We could have people in. The
                    furniture was classical furniture that had come from the embassy in Paris. It
                    was really a great setup.</p>
                <p>My children went to school in Vienna. My wife used to drive them. The nuns at
                    that school were some of the same nuns my wife had had when she went to the
                    Sacred Heart School in Budapest as a girl. During the time of persecution in
                    Hungary these nuns were told to go back to their houses, they were not nuns any
                    more. But the Vatican somehow was able to negotiate and get them all out to
                    Vienna where they reconstituted the group. Since the number of nuns was
                    declining, even then, most of the nuns in these various schools were
                    Hungarian.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>My wife used to work in the study hall as a volunteer teaching the kids English
                    and math (because my wife has a degree in chemistry, and she's very good in
                    math). They don't have the same church and state situation that we have. Even
                    though they're nuns, These teachers are all licensed under Austrian law. It was
                    very much Hungarian nuns, and they liked my wife, because she was Hungarian.
                    There was an opening for a teacher doing what my wife did as a volunteer in the
                    study hall. The nun in charge of the school said, “There's an opening. Why don't
                    you go down and apply for that job?” And she said, “But they're complaining that
                    there are too many Hungarians here.” “Don't tell them you're Hungarian.” Well,
                    my wife went down and applied, and the man was very polite to her and listened
                    to her and accepted her as qualified and approved her to be a teacher in the
                    Austrian schools. And then he escorted her to the door to say goodbye, and he
                    said, “Mrs. Martin, you're really Hungarian, aren't you?” He knew.</p>
                <p>A lot of my ideas of how women should be treated in this country come from
                    Austria. They have a shortage of people there very often. When the economy is
                    booming, they allow refugees and immigrants to come in. When the economy turns
                    down, they try to get rid of them. But one of the things, they do is try to get
                    women out of the families into the workforce. Here you have to have 40 quarters
                    of employment to qualify for Social Security; there a housewife, while she's a
                    housewife, qualifies for Social Security. I think we should have that here, and
                    all the family allowances they have there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the East-West Trade Center, did you have much contact
                        with the East?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: I traveled all the way to the East and the East was very interested in
                    us. We were right next door to the office of a Russian delegation to
                    international organizations. Right across the park, a few blocks away, was the
                    Russian embassy, and it was headed by somebody who was a member of the Central
                    Committee in Moscow. All their key ambassadors, generally speaking, including
                    the guy who was here, Dobrynin, were members of the Central Committee and so was
                    this guy. The Russians from the Soviet Union, officials, would come in. Let's
                    say we had a catalogue show for three weeks. They'd have a guy come in every day
                    for three weeks and copy stuff out of our catalogues. They were using it as an
                    information database. I had this guy from the Department of Commerce. He had a
                    secretary, and then we had people who were in the Commercial Section. We had two
                    of them working for me; the one from the Department of Commerce, the market
                    research guy I spoke of, worked for me, too.</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>I had a secretary. It was always hard to find secretaries because the educational
                    system in Vienna trains people in languages, but not in typing. Or they train
                    people in typing but not in languages. To find somebody who knew English and who
                    could type was not very easy. I had to fire somebody who just couldn't type a
                    letter. It would take her all day hunting and pecking like this to do one
                    letter. I got another secretary who was very nice but she wasn't there too long.
                    I got a call to see the security officer. He said, “You know, that person
                    working for you. I didn't want to believe it when I first saw it, so I had it
                    checked out again.” He said, “But there's no doubt. She's an Israeli spy.” So we
                    had to get rid of her. I said - you know, she's a very nice person, middle aged
                    lady, Catholic, married to a Jewish guy. She was going on leave in about two
                    weeks, “I'll wait until then.” He said okay. When she was going on vacation, I
                    said, I want to see you before you go on vacation after work today. She came in
                    to see me. Everybody had gone home. I said, “You know, I like you very much, and
                    I want you to know that we appreciate all the work you've done for us. People
                    like you here.” She looked kind of glad. I said, “That's what makes it very
                    difficult for me to tell you what I have to tell you. We're going to have to let
                    you go. I can't tell you specifically why because I don't know specifically why,
                    but I've been told that we can't retain you as an employee here.” She cried, and
                    then she left. She knew what I was saying. She did not argue with me. She knew
                    why she couldn't work there. She was a middle-aged woman, past the age of having
                    a baby. She came in some time later after she had gone and said, “You know, I
                    told people that I had a baby and gave it up for adoption while I was away, and
                    that's why I had to stay away.”</p>
                <p>We had about 50 American companies come to us, and I described our relationship
                    with the East and gave them pointers. We also were getting after the people in
                    the embassies in the East that they should be promoting trade more actively,
                    because this was the time of detente. Our ambassador was great, John P. Humes.
                    Whenever they mentioned him in the paper, they'd always add that he had
                    contributed $100,000 to the Nixon campaign when he was in the primaries. It was
                    true, but he was also a very good ambassador in that he realized that what he
                    could do would be promote trade and representation. He never got too much into
                    the political. The political reporting from Vienna wasn't all that interesting
                    to him.</p>
                <p>Cardinal Mindszenty left Hungary at that time and went to Rome, but I guess he
                    didn't want to stay in Rome, or maybe they didn't want him to stay either, so he
                    came back to Vienna. He had been in effect a prisoner in the American embassy in
                    Budapest, and here he was right next door to us, because what had been the
                    consular academy was our embassy in Vienna and it was right across the street
                    from the university, and right next to it was something called the Pazmaneum,
                    which was a residence college for Hungarian priests studying at the University
                    of Vienna at one time. We didn't really have contact with him, and he died a
                    couple of years later. He was operated on for a prostate problem, and then I
                    guess he threw a clot and died the next day.</p>
                <p>I traveled around Austria, and I went to Moscow twice. I went to all the
                    countries. At the mission in West Berlin was a guy named Felix Bloch.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: And Felix Bloch came down to Vienna a couple of times, and something
                    interesting happened. I kid with people or I say some outrageously things at
                    times. The two of us were walking on Karntnerstrasse, and he went in and bought
                    these brandy snifters at this famous place where they sell glass and crystal in
                    Vienna. These were gigantic brandy snifters, he bought a dozen of them. I said,
                    “Hey, Felix, what are you doing? You can't afford that.” I couldn't afford to
                    buy them. He looked at me in a strange way, kind of shocked. But I was just
                    talking, and I didn't say anything to anybody. Later on they said they traced
                    him back to the '70's, and I'm sure he must have been doing something when he
                    came through there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about Felix Bloch who was later deputy chief
                        of mission in Vienna and was accused - he still hasn't been convicted - -and
                        dismissed from the Service for being paid by the Soviets.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Right. I knew Felix quite well, and the two of us went to the Leipzig
                    fair. I spent three days with him that time, so I knew Felix quite well. He was
                    a close friend of Henry Bardach, who was the chief of the Economic Section
                    there. And he used to stay with Henry when he came to Vienna. When the thing
                    broke, Henry is not the kind of person you want in a firefight on your side. I
                    said to him, “Hey, Henry, your friend Felix Bloch's in trouble.” He said, “Your
                    friend, your friend.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, to give Henry due credit, he landed in a glider on
                        D-Day.-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: By mistake. He landed a glider on D-Day because he didn't volunteer to be
                    a paratrooper, and they said, “You guys that didn't volunteer to be
                    paratroopers, you're going to be in the gliders.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: I was there from 1976 to 1978.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>MARTIN: I was the deputy secretary general for economic affairs in CENTO, the
                    Central Treaty Organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about CENTO in '76. What was the status of
                        CENTO, and then the importance, and what you were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: You can't talk about CENTO in '76 without going back to its establishment
                    as part of the Baghdad Pact. In the mind of Secretary Dulles, the Baghdad Pact
                    was going to be part of the ring around the Soviet Union for the security of the
                    United States. But the Baghdad Pact presented problems in several ways. First,
                    the Arab countries perceived it as a reestablishment of the old Turkish Empire,
                    so they were suspicious of it. It died because before Iraq tried to join, there
                    was a coup and the king of Iraq was assassinated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: July 14, 1958.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: So the participation of Arab countries in the Baghdad Pact never took
                    place. Another factor was Israel. The United States understood that if we
                    established an alliance with some Arab countries, then the Israelis would want
                    something countervailing. They would want us to be in some sort of alliance with
                    them. That wasn't going to work out. But there was a need for something in that
                    area of the world, because on one end you had Turkey, which was a part of NATO,
                    and at the other end was going to be Pakistan, which was a part, I believe, of
                    SEATO. That was to be the connection from SEATO to CENTO to NATO, so you had a
                    security ring of alliances around the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>Because of these various objections, we never actually were members of CENTO.
                    However, through some complicated legal arrangement, that Secretary Dulles was
                    able to work out, we were members of every committee of CENTO. We were members
                    of the Economic Committee, and I was the deputy secretary general for economic
                    affairs. We were members of the Military Committee, and the Military Committee
                    was ruled by a council, which consisted of five three-star generals, and the
                    military implementation of CENTO was under the leadership of an American major
                    general. Both these jobs rotated between air force and army. My colleague was
                    Major General Healy, who had been in charge of special forces in Vietnam, a
                    wonderful person.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>In a sense, CENTO almost died a-borning, and though it did survive, and many
                    thought of it as moribund. By the time I got there, there had been a war between
                    India and Pakistan. Pakistan, being a member of CENTO, expected the other CENTO
                    countries to come to their aid, but this wasn't going to happen and didn't
                    happen. Instead we said, “Work that out among yourselves; work it out with the
                    Indians.” The Pakistanis were unhappy with CENTO from then on, and the
                    organization was tied up in a situation where they could not agree on the
                    political guidance. The Pakistanis wanted to have an agreement on a policy that
                    would require the other countries to come to Pakistan's aid. Even though we
                    tilted against India, we did not come to their aid with troops or arms or any
                    other supplies. And they were unhappy with that. So the political guidance
                    couldn't be agreed on, and the alliance just kept going along.</p>
                <p>I was one of the only people, and the military too who were engaged in something
                    called “region building.” We were trying to connect up the three countries:
                    Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan, and then the U.S. and the British. We were trying to
                    connect up their communications, transportation, and through any projects that
                    would enable them to cooperate with each other.</p>
                <p>For example, in the field of air transportation, we used to run an air traffic
                    control program every year and send people from the three countries to London to
                    the Air Traffic Control School. I went there myself. We had a conference on air
                    traffic control and the problems of air traffic control in that area. We also
                    did a lot of road building. There was transportation coming down from Europe
                    through Turkey to Iran, because at that time there was a lot of economic
                    activity between the US and Iran and Europe and Iran. The Turks were not
                    interested in helping Iranian trade with Western Europe, so they just neglected
                    the roads. As the roads got closer and closer to Iran, going through Turkey,
                    they got worse and worse. We were doing some road building, trying to improve
                    the road connections. We were trying to improve the ferry traffic connection
                    across Lake Van. We also had a project to improve the communications microwave
                    link across Turkey to Iran and Pakistan.</p>
                <p>The military people had exercises every year. They'd have a small-infantry-unit
                    cooperative exercise where the five countries would send units and compete with
                    each other. There was a naval exercise every year. The Pakistanis had a
                    submarine, and they would try to chase after some of the Iranian ships during
                    this naval exercise, testing their anti-submarine capabilities and the abilities
                    of the submarine to evade and attack.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>We had a science program going, and that was headed by a British scientist who
                    was in Teheran. We were funding a program in dental health, trying to study the
                    effects of fluorine on people's teeth because for some strange reason, the
                    highest concentration of fluoride in the world in water is found in the Aras
                    River, right at the eastern end of Turkey, and the river runs into Iran. So we
                    had some Turkish scientists and some Iranian scientists taking samples from the
                    river and seeing what the effect was on the animals, the cows and cattle, that
                    drank from river. It was being done by an American scientist from the University
                    of Rochester Dental School. They were doing a double-blind study. The Turks
                    didn't have the equipment, didn't have the funds, and the Iranians had
                    everything. Yet the Turkish results seemed to be better and stood up better than
                    the Iranian results.</p>
                <p>Another important part of the job was conferences and meetings, in the three
                    countries. I got a great chance to travel throughout the region and also to
                    London, when the committees had their annual meetings. I got a chance to go to
                    Shiraz. I traveled all around Iran. We had a meeting of the secretary general, a
                    top meeting, in Iran one year, and we went to a state dinner given by the Shah
                    of Iran, although he didn't appear at the state dinner; so we didn't actually
                    meet him. We traveled down to Persepolis, which was where Iran the previous year
                    had had a celebration of its 5,000th year. It was unbelievable to see this tent
                    city that had been built, air conditioned tents, but also Persepolis is a
                    marvelous place, celebrating the victory of the Persians 5,000 years ago. Darius
                    defeated somebody.</p>
                <p>I traveled throughout the region and also to London, but never got to the United
                    States, because one year when the meeting was going to be held in the United
                    States, it conflicted with a NATO meeting that was taking place.</p>
                <p>I traveled all over Pakistan, and became quite familiar with the place. They were
                    very interested in getting a $500,000 microwave link from us. We wanted it to
                    happen, but it never did. Turkey was a fascinating country for anybody who has
                    even the slightest sense of history. It's where it all started. Everybody in
                    Europe came across the steppes of Russia and either went north around the Black
                    Sea or through Turkey. Yet people didn't know much about it because there's
                    nothing about Turkey in the Bible. They talk about Asia Minor, and a lot
                    happened there, not just the Christian religion but also earlier than that, the
                    Hittites were in Turkey. The first library in the world is found in Turkey among
                    the Hittites. They call it the earliest known formal library. Croesus, the
                    Greeks, it all happened there. So it was a great country to be in and to
                    visit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting from CENTO, what was the American
                        military and other civilian impression of, one, the Soviet threat at that
                        time ('76-78) and, two, the capabilities as far as Turkey, Iran, and
                        Pakistan are concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>MARTIN: Traditionally this was always a key strategic area because the Russians
                    always had their eye on the south and a warm-water port, going through Iran or
                    through Turkey, and they had invaded. They had occupied part of Turkey, Kars,
                    after World War I. After World War II there was Azerbaijan, where we almost went
                    to war with the Russians before they pulled back. General Michael D. Healy when
                    he gave a briefing, used to say, “We have so many Soviet divisions pinned down
                    here, with our troops, the Turkish, Iranian, and Pakistani armies.” But somehow
                    it didn't seem real to me that we were “pinning down” any Russian troops there,
                    as I think their main focus was directed to the west, not to the south. Still,
                    the Soviets, did not like CENTO at all. I remember once meeting a couple of
                    Russians at a reception. Somebody said, “This is Mr. Martin from CENTO,” and the
                    Soviet guy went “Ugh! Ugh!” You know, showing disgust toward CENTO. We didn't
                    have any conversation at all. They didn't like it and they were watching what we
                    were doing.</p>
                <p>The main thing at that time was that we had an embargo on resupply of weapons to
                    the Turks, because they had invaded Cyprus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1974.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes, and there was tension between the Greeks and the Turks. That was the
                    background of our relationship with Turkey at that time. The embargo at first
                    didn't have much effect. It takes time. But by the time I got there in 1976,
                    there was a feeling that maybe shortages of ammunition and spare parts were
                    beginning to hurt the Turks. Still it didn't stop them. I had people from all of
                    the nationalities represented in CENTO and it was my first close contact with
                    Muslims. I had Pakistani Muslims working for me on the clerical staff. I
                    remember going by somebody's office one day, and he was up on his desk going
                    through his morning prayers.</p>
                <p>A big thing there was the Hajj. Every Muslim during his life, if he possibly can
                    do it, even at some sacrifice, tries to make the Hajj. These clerical employees
                    of CENTO were horribly low-paid people, but they all wanted to make the Hajj,
                    and if they wanted to go, they could get leave and go. We tried to help them go,
                    and they really appreciated that a lot. The more sophisticated of the Pakistanis
                    - my deputy was a Pakistani - and his wife was quite religious, and she wanted
                    to make the Hajj. So off they went. This fellow used to like to drink, and he
                    got stopped at the border of Saudi Arabia because he had a case of scotch in the
                    back of his car. He didn't want to give it up. He turned around and went back.
                    He didn't make the Hajj. I think his wife continued on with a friend. But he
                    liked to have a supply of scotch wherever he went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there the feeling in CENTO at that time that the
                        Soviets were poised to invade?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>MARTIN: There was never a feeling of crisis, never a feeling of tension. We went
                    through our exercises. We had been doing it for years before I got there, and we
                    continued. We would have continued after I left except this crisis with the
                    political guidance eventually led to a stalemate among the political people.
                    Then when the crisis came in Iran, CENTO didn't formally dissolve, but it just
                    vanished. There was no more CENTO because Iran was gone. It didn't make any
                    sense to keep it going, so my job there at the end, when we were getting
                    smaller, was trying to get jobs for my people, get them jobs at the embassy or
                    find someplace for them, so that was my main activity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there when the Shah left, were you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: No, that happened afterwards, but we were already reorganizing CENTO and
                    were trying to find people jobs. For example, we used to give funds to CENTO as
                    a whole, and then there was an American grant that was over and above our
                    general grant to CENTO. I had an American employee. But the secretary general
                    who succeeded the one who was there when I first arrived didn't like that, and
                    neither did the Pakistani deputy secretary general, and so they said they would
                    only accept the grant if they were in charge. We agreed. But once that happened,
                    we were reorganizing, and we were cutting down on American employees there.</p>
                <p>There was a lot of tension in Iran, and I remember speaking with one of my
                    Turkish subordinates who had attended a briefing given to all Turkish diplomats.
                    He was telling me that the difference from the way Turkey was then was Turkey
                    had gone through its revolution when Kemal Atat�rk came in. Atat�rk stomped on
                    the mullahs and got control over the mullahs so you couldn't have this
                    fundamentalist Islamic point of view running a country. He said people laughed
                    at Turks around the world because they wore fezzes. He said you could not wear a
                    fez; it became illegal. You had to wear a cap, and the cap had a peak on it so
                    that you couldn't bend down to the ground and have your forehead touch the
                    ground in prayer. Basically, he secularized the country. By the time I got
                    there, this hurt the Christian and other religions, but it hadn't killed Islam
                    altogether, and Islam was coming back. From what I read in the newspapers, the
                    fundamentalist Islamic party is pretty powerful and there's a real fight going
                    on with the military.</p>
                <p>So I would say, at that time, the main background to everything was the American
                    embargo, which tainted our relationship with Turkey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a subject that came up all the time with the
                        Turks with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: No, it never came up with me. It was an issue for the embassy. Where we
                    were we had a very happy group. There was a secretary general that rotated -</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the secretary general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Halop Bailokan. He had been a minister in the Turkish Government, and
                    later he was minister of defense, and he was an important ambassador. He was
                    succeeded by Ambassador Gurun, who had been the ambassador to Greece at the time
                    they broke relations with the Turks. He had at that time been on leave
                    somewhere. They couldn't locate him. He was, I would say, a bit in eclipse at
                    the time, but he was very smart, and the Turks were very interested in keeping
                    CENTO going.</p>
                <p>There were five of us at the deputy secretary general level. My British colleague
                    was the counselor to the secretary general, and the administrator was Pakistani,
                    the military man. I was the economic man. And the Turkish person was in charge
                    of all files and things like that, all the documentation. That was mainly
                    Turkish. There was an Iranian too. The Iranian was in charge of health programs.
                    But everybody got along very well, and then within each section there were
                    always five employees, from the five different nationalities. My deputy was a
                    Pakistani, a very nice person. He was the fellow that couldn't make the Hajj
                    because he couldn't give up his case of scotch.</p>
                <p>One of the American there had done a study showing no one who went to CENTO ever
                    got promoted. It was definitely low on the totem pole in Washington, and the
                    reason for that was that Ankara was part of the European Bureau in Washington,
                    but CENTO was part of the NEA Bureau. It just didn't get much attention back in
                    Washington. That's just the way it was. When I left, the efficiency report had
                    to be written by somebody in the embassy who was in the political-military
                    section, a counselor for political-military affairs. He said I didn't know many
                    Americans there, which was true - because my universe of people and contacts was
                    in the international community — but somehow he thought I should have been known
                    as an embassy employee. But I enjoyed it very much, and can recommend working in
                    any international organization to anybody in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there, did the problem of the Kurds come up
                        in CENTO?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes. I mentioned this study of fluorine in the water. There were about
                    five villages in eastern Turkey where we visited when we were doing the fluorine
                    study of a river that flowed into Iran. Even though it had a high concentration
                    to the point where it was killing some of the cattle - the sheep would drink
                    this water and after a while they couldn't eat because their mouths became very
                    sensitive and their gums receded from their teeth - the Turks didn't seem to
                    care. They were combining these villages into one watershed, and the water was
                    bad. It was true they were going to have more water, and it seemed all right
                    when you drank it, but you couldn't drink it for long. If you drank it for a
                    couple of years, it would affect you very adversely. I remember when we went to
                    this village, we went into a home of a family - it was just almost a hovel,
                    little more than a tent - but what struck me was the ground was covered with
                    these beautiful carpets. Somebody told me later they were Kurds. The Turks would
                    never tell you you were in a Kurdish village, but the Kurds were there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At one point during the Kissinger period, we had been
                        supporting the Kurds in Iraq, and then we cut them off. Did our support for
                        the Kurds play any role at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Not that I knew of. The Turks would never mention the Kurds. They would
                    never say “Kurds.” Somebody said they call them “Mountain Turks.” But I never
                    heard them called Mountain Turks either.</p>
                <p>There was an air station in Ankara. My kids went to school there; we used to go
                    out to the chapel there and the PX. My kids used to ride horses out there. We
                    owned a couple of horses, which everybody did. If you had teenage girls
                    especially, you'd have horses. The horses were on the edge adjoining the Balgat
                    Air Station. They called it an air station, although there were no planes there,
                    because it was headed by a colonel in the air force. On this adjoining area
                    where the horses were, all the people working there were Kurds. It was a
                    village, and they were all Kurds.</p>

                </p>

                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>MARTIN: '78 to '80. I was the counselor for economic affairs, commercial
                    counselor, and AID affairs officer. Nigeria had a reputation, fostered somewhat
                    by my predecessor, of being one of the worst posts in the world, heavily
                    populated. It's the first place I had been assigned where my wife said she was
                    scared. She was scared not because anybody was threatening her so much; just the
                    density of the population, the mass of the people in Lagos was something
                    unbelievable, and it really led to some misperceptions. We used to say there
                    were 100 million people in Nigeria, that every fourth or fifth African was a
                    Nigerian, and that they had 256 tribes, 250 languages, but in fact there were
                    three major groups. The people in the north, the Hausas, who spoke the Hausa
                    languages and who were Muslims, and the Hausa Fulani were the ruling group. In
                    the south, where we were, were the Yorubas. They were Christian and Muslim. In
                    the east were the Ibos who were Christians, mainly Catholic, as a matter of
                    fact.</p>
                <p>During the civil war it was the Ibo that had rebelled, and that was where the oil
                    was, in the east. Lagos, Nigeria, was very important at that time because it was
                    the second largest source of oil for the United States after, I think,
                    Venezuela. The 100 million number resulted if you added up what every tribe said
                    it had. They had never had a census. They didn't really know how many people
                    they had. Yet when you drove out of Lagos and went around the country, you had a
                    feeling there were vast empty areas as well. There were these densely populated
                    areas down in the south, and there was a historic reason for that, the people in
                    the north were slave dealers, and they used to go on raids to the south, capture
                    slaves, bring them all the way across Africa and sell them in the Near East. To
                    get away from them the people had moved more and more to the south. Bob Frazier,
                    who was killed in Bosnia-Herzegovina, was a junior officer there. He was the one
                    that told me this. Those areas that seemed to be empty, he said were empty
                    because they were “slaved out,” and there was some Muslim later who said, “When
                    I die, I'll die with a slave in my hands.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to move to this period of '78-80. How did we view
                        the economics? Was this the time of port problems and corruption? Could you
                        talk about our view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: The unbelievable port problem was over. That was a major scandal that had
                    taken place, and I had come across it while I was in Vienna. Somebody came into
                    my office with an unbelievably large order for Americans stuff, to be sent to
                    Lagos by ship. I heard that it took four of five months. Every Greek ship in the
                    world seemed to head toward Lagos Harbor and stand out in the harbor waiting to
                    get permission to come in and unload. The crew would fly back to Greece and come
                    back with another ship. They would leave three or four people on board just to
                    keep the ship Greek and waiting, and make money because of these port charges.
                    When I got there, oil was mostly American production by Gulf and Mobil, but
                    there was also some British companies and some smaller oil companies. That was
                    why it was important to us, oil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find it for getting statistics, for
                        negotiating with the Nigerian Government?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>MARTIN: Well, probably our most important report was the monthly oil production
                    statistics, and they were very good about giving us that. We had no trouble. You
                    could go into their oil ministry, and they would give you their figures for the
                    month and tell you something about it. Where you couldn't get reliable
                    statistics was the foreign exchange. They had a fixed exchange rate, and they
                    controlled the foreign exchange. If you were a Nigerian, you could get a permit
                    to buy foreign exchange. You would pay a certain amount of nira, the Nigerian
                    unit of currency, and basically you would be paying like 70, and you would get a
                    dollar, and for the dollar you could get 100 nira cash back on the street. If
                    you could go in a circle long enough, you could become wealthy.</p>
                <p>The main thing I wanted to mention is corruption. The country is unbelievably
                    corrupt. It was corrupt at every level, and yet politically we were very happy
                    there because General Obasanjo, who had just become the head of Government there
                    again, was in charge. He had promised to turn the government over to civilian
                    rule. The corruption was very bad to the point where I remember once I was
                    traveling in the country, and the driver wanted to stop to buy some onions in a
                    place fairly far out from Lagos. On the way back to town, he wanted to do some
                    shopping. So we stopped. As soon as we stopped, over came a girl about 12 years
                    old carrying a baby. I reached out to touch the baby on the head, as anybody
                    would do, she pulled the baby away and said, “Dash me,” dash being the term for
                    'bribe.' If you brought a letter to a ministry to get it delivered to a
                    minister, people said you had to pay the secretary or she would not deliver the
                    letter to her own boss. A priest friend who ran a school there told me he came
                    across a kid who didn't do his homework. And he said, “Why didn't you do your
                    homework?” And the kid said, “Father, one of the older boys tapped my notebook.”
                    So he said, “I hope when you get to be an older boy, you won't tap the younger
                    boys books.” He said, “Father, I'm going to tap all I can.”</p>
                <p>This culture of corruption was so strong there that I heard about it on the plane
                    coming in. I was talking to an Indian businessman. The Indians were fairly
                    strong there. He said, “You know, it's not whether you pay,” because I had said,
                    you know, we don't pay bribes to people. He said, “You know, in Lagos, it's not
                    whether you pay or not - you must pay. It's so corrupt you must pay or you can't
                    get anything done, but the trick is to know how little you can pay to still get
                    it done.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we reporting this corruption as being absolutely
                        corrosive? Was the money going into the pockets of the ruling class, or was
                        it getting out to the people?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>MARTIN: It wasn't getting out to the little people, no, but it was getting into
                    projects. Certain projects were being done. There were projects, for example,
                    there were roads all over the place. They had roads right through Lagos,
                    although the traffic in Lagos was unbelievably bad. There was a story of
                    somebody who left the embassy to go on a plane leaving the post. He left at
                    noontime to catch a six o'clock flight, and he missed it. If there were no
                    traffic, you could get out to the airport in about an hour. It was pretty far.
                    But on the way, the tie-ups would be unbelievable. Their skill with the language
                    is marvelous. They use words like “a go-slow”: “I'm caught in a go-slow.” We had
                    electricity going off all the time. There were water shortages. The telephone
                    never worked.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, there was a feeling that they could make it work if they
                    wanted to. I'll give you an example. My mother died while I was there. Every
                    once in a while the phone would ring, I'd pick it up, and there'd be nothing.
                    One day the phone rang, and I picked it up and it was my son calling me from the
                    United States to tell me that my mother had died. Now all during the time I was
                    there, people said, “You'd better pay your phone bill.” I kept paying my phone
                    bill even though the phone wasn't working, which seemed kind of stupid, but I
                    think the ambassador didn't want people coming and saying so-and-so hasn't paid
                    his phone bill, even though the phone just about never worked. If you wanted to
                    make an international call, you could go down to the main post office kind of
                    building, and then you could make a call to the States, but otherwise the
                    telephone just didn't work.</p>
                <p>We had radio communication. We'd call in for radio check all the time, and so we
                    overcame it. For electricity, I had my own generator. I had a beautiful house.
                    It was built during the British colonial days. It was on stilts, so it had a
                    breeze, and large rooms and all that, although it was air conditioned. Robbery
                    was very bad there. It was dangerous. They had the death penalty. They would
                    have public executions regularly, and they were big for reporting in the
                    newspaper the person's last words. That was one of the big things, which we have
                    in our tradition too. When we execute somebody, they always have a little thing
                    in the paper, “Last words.” It's part of our Judeo-Christian tradition that a
                    person that's dying can make a statement. They used to bring them down to the
                    beach and shoot them. Huge crowds would show up on a Saturday when they were
                    going to have an execution. The executions were ordered by a military tribunal,
                    for armed robbery. An armed robbery could be with any kind of weapon, even with
                    a stick. But if the person were armed and got caught robbing, he would normally
                    get the death sentence, and they carried it out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>MARTIN: Don Easum. He was very happy that he had contributed to some extent to
                    the promise of General Obasanjo to transition into a civilian r�gime.
                    Politically we were on a high point. A year before I came there had been a
                    Presidential visit, which I'm sure that Easum considered the apex of his time
                    there. A visit by President Carter was considered a great success. Following
                    that, we agreed we would have economic talks, and it fell to me to do them with
                    the Nigerians. We had certain issues. For example, Pan American Airways used to
                    have a flight that went down the coast of West Africa. They had two flights a
                    week. They wanted to increase it to four, but the Nigerians wouldn't let them,
                    because they were planning to have their own airline, Nigerian Airways, which
                    would go to the United States. They wanted at the very least to share
                    passengers. Most people would rather go on Pan Am than on Nigerian Airways, and
                    so they would not allow an increase in Pan Am. We kept asking them, and they
                    kept saying no.</p>
                <p>Because the government had so much foreign exchange, our aid program was running
                    out. I was the aid affairs officer. We'd just had a program where we were
                    funding a couple of teachers around the country in different places and that
                    money was running out. I did have some residual funds that were left over from
                    projects where they hadn't used up all the money, and eventually I cleaned that
                    up. We made a donation to a library and got rid of the program because it was
                    running out anyway.</p>
                <p>Because it had so much foreign exchange, there was an organization established, I
                    think with Saudi Arabia and Nigeria. It was reimbursable foreign aid, where we
                    would offer to come in with our aid resources, do some project, and they would
                    pay for it. I had a man working for me who was responsible for that, and he was
                    really a very capable guy with many years in AID. He would write up a project
                    proposal and present it to them, but they really didn't want to pay for foreign
                    aid, so they would just stall on it. We never got one through.</p>
                <p>They did mention AID once in a while. Even though they had this huge foreign
                    exchange, they still were hoping we would give them aid, because after all,
                    we're the United States, and they're Nigeria. Their people are poor. Why not?
                    Finally, AID, which is a bureaucratic institution and wanted to have its own
                    mission there, proposed that we give $10 million, even though Nigeria had so
                    much money. Easum disappointed me on this. He was very smart, and he knew what
                    he was doing. He said, “Let them fight that out in Washington.” I thought we
                    should have gone in and said, this is ridiculous. When Ambassador Stephen Low
                    succeeded Easum, he went around for his briefing and talked to the man in charge
                    of the institution in Washington and said, “There's this proposal for $10
                    million for aid to Nigeria. This is ridiculous.” But AID wanted it. They sent a
                    guy out, and he was very upset with me that I wasn't giving him full support. I
                    just said, “Well, the embassy can't, but, good luck to you.” That's all we said,
                    and he was upset with that.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>When I got there, there was a Lieutenant Colonel, United States Army Engineer
                    Corps, who had experience on the Mississippi River. We had a proposal to redo
                    the Niger- Benue River, and it would have cost a huge amount of money, but it
                    would have been of huge benefit to the country. He had talks with them about it,
                    but in the end they weren't going to pay anything for any American aid. We also
                    had a proposal for ID cards, because they had a problem with a lot of people
                    walking around from other African countries who were undocumented. It would have
                    given them the chance to control the population a little better, or know who was
                    what and where. It could have been used as a kind of census. That didn't happen
                    either. There were about six important projects. There had been some major
                    commercial deals by my predecessor there. For example, there was the largest
                    combat boot sale to any institution other than the United States army, because
                    their local combat boots were poor. Combat boots have to have good leather, and
                    the American leather is thicker than the European leather, and so our American
                    combat boots were suitable, and they ordered I don't know how many million.
                    Their army was a very good army, professionally trained, mainly by the British.
                    They still had some British officers up in the north for training the Nigerian
                    army, and it was the only institution that you might call a national
                    institution. It somehow was trying to integrate the different tribal groups.</p>
                <p>We had the largest single commercial or trade opportunity I ever dealt with, and
                    it was successful. When I was first there, the Nigerian Government became
                    interested in having a fertilizer plant using the petrochemical resources of the
                    country. Poland Kellogg (now under a different name) was the company that was
                    the leader in petrochemical fertilizer plants and had almost a monopoly. These
                    are very expensive. They came in and made a proposal to build one for $600
                    million, which was really very high. The Nigerians told us they wanted it. I
                    told the Poland Kellogg people, who are pretty shrewd negotiators, that they
                    wanted it. They guy said, “Well, if they want it, they're going to have to pay
                    for it.”</p>
                <p>The Nigerians hired an Irishman who was an expert in this type of fertilizer
                    plant, and then they started negotiating. It took them 18 months, but before I
                    left, they signed an agreement for $500 million. The Nigerians did feel that
                    this company was trying to take advantage of them, and that they had to watch
                    them very closely, getting them down from the $600 million down to $500 million.
                    By the time the $500 million fertilizer plant was about to be agreed -
                    everything was agreed more or less, a trade mission came over headed by Andrew
                    Young. During that trade mission, and in the presence of General Obasanjo, they
                    agreed to the $500 million contract, and Andy Young got the credit - it was in
                    Newsweek, and Time. This was very good politically. Andrew Young was our
                    ambassador to the UN. He got fired while he was there, but he helped Easum get
                    to be the head of the African Affairs Institute, which is what he did for about
                    five years after he retired.</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>Easum loved tennis. As part of the tennis circuit, there was a tournament in
                    Lagos. I think the tennis players considered it to be just at the bottom of the
                    pile, but it did get them points for their ranking. An Austrian came down, named
                    Feigl, and also a guy stayed with me who has since become more or less famous if
                    you follow tennis, Larry Stefanki. Easum encouraged us and I liked that idea,
                    too, of having these tennis players stay with us while they were there. Larry
                    Stefanki later became John McEnroe's trainer and was just in the papers within
                    the past six months or so. He trained this guy who came up and almost became
                    number one, a guy from Chile named Rios, I think. But anyway, Stefanki is a
                    figure now in American tennis. I see his name every once in a while, and during
                    the US Open he's one of the broadcasters, and he's close to John McEnroe.</p>
                <p>The transition to civilian rule took place while I was there. Civilian rule was
                    more corrupt, by a lot, than the military rule. It was a shame, because the
                    country could have done something with the oil. Overall, I would say that
                    Nigeria was worse off for having discovered oil, even though it brought them a
                    huge amount of money. It brought the kind of thing where their recent dictator,
                    General Abacha was killed; they brought in three prostitutes and a supply of
                    Viagra, gave it to him, he had a heart attack and died. They think there was
                    something else in the pill - it wasn't just the Viagra that killed him. It was
                    some kind of poison. They assassinated him.</p>
                <p>It was kind of a dangerous place and very difficult to deal with servants. This
                    was my introduction to Africa, and I've often thought, if I had it to do over
                    again, I might have liked to be an African specialist because I love Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in 1980. . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Right, in 1980 I left and came back to Washington. I was over complement.
                    That's okay, because they asked me to serve on the Board of Examiners, and I
                    became a deputy examiner. That was a title on the Board of Examiners [BEX]. For
                    three years I did that, traveling around the United States, and that's where you
                    and I met each other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, '80 to '83.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: 1980-83. It was great. I liked it very much, for a number of reasons. In
                    the first place, I was in contact with young people. I got to see the attitudes
                    of younger people. The head of BEX told me a few months after I left, “You know,
                    one-third of the people in the Foreign Service today passed through your hands
                    during that time in 1980-83, and I had something to do with each one of them, in
                    a way, because either I'd be on the panel or I would be going through the final
                    review panel, looking at their security and so forth. It gave me an attitude
                    toward the Foreign Service that was very favorable.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the caliber and the attitude
                        toward the service of this '80-83 contingent that you saw?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: In the first place, it was quite clear to me that we were trying to pick
                    the best out of this group, but also this was a time when they were emphasizing
                    women and minorities, so we were paying very close attention to them. The vast
                    majority, 85 or 90 percent - of these people were qualified to be Foreign
                    Service officers and would have done a good job had they been accepted.
                    Unfortunately, we used to start out with perhaps 18,000, and then they'd get
                    about 2,500 passing the written exam, and out of the 2,500 they'd get down to
                    500 or so who'd get onto the register, and most of those 500 would get an offer
                    of some type or other. Maybe they wanted to be political officers or economic
                    officers or in USIA but they'd be offered a chance to be consular officers or
                    administrative officers, and maybe they didn't want that.</p>
                <p>Still, they would get an offer to come into the Foreign Service. I was very
                    favorably impressed. I also was not surprised that there was a sameness about
                    them. They talk about diversity - these people came from many different schools,
                    but they were all alike. For example, I come from a family of people that belong
                    to unions, and I was raised to have a favorable attitude toward unions. These
                    people almost without exception talked negatively about unions. We stopped
                    asking questions on labor, because they know almost nothing about labor except
                    that they don't like unions. I wonder what that's going to do to the country.
                    Union membership in the country is declining, but I sometimes wonder about the
                    American worker. The American workers got no sympathy from the typical kid
                    coming out of college, very smart, able to pass a written exam and the oral exam
                    whose attitude towards the unions was very negative.</p>
                <p>I was also surprised at how remarkably good some people were. Some people did
                    really stand out. I can remember one woman. I wanted to find out later where she
                    had gone to school. She had gone to Columbia, which I was happy about. We asked
                    this person a question about the Near East in the wake of the assassination or
                    death of somebody -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anwar Sadat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes, and she said, the problem was leadership. Then she went around the
                    whole region, every country. She mentioned every country, named the leader and
                    why the person was not quite up to what was needed at that time in the Near
                    East. That's just one example. I was very favorably impressed by the quality of
                    the people, but I also thought that we had so many who had studied Russian and
                    Russian studies, for example. They specialized in some field, and maybe their
                    score was not high enough to get into the political cone, which they would have
                    wanted. I wondered whether they were going to be happy as consular officers. I
                    understand they've changed the system now. It's more amorphous now.</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>We had a number of lawsuits that caused us to re-examine more people who had
                    passed the written exam. Many people got a chance to be re-examined. We had some
                    very good minority candidates and women candidates, lots of very, very good
                    ones.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find you were making any stretch to pass
                        minorities particularly? In other words, when they came, would you
                        internally - I realize everybody's supposed to be judged the same - but were
                        you reaching out more?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Oh, yes, definitely. We were reaching out, but that didn't mean we didn't
                    have some very good candidates. I remember we had a fellow from my neighborhood
                    in Brooklyn. We used to ask them what they liked to do and what their interests
                    were. We stopped that later on. This guy told us that he liked boxing, and that
                    he thought he was a very good dancer. We never got an answer like that from
                    anybody else. He also gave very good responses to all our questions, and I
                    wonder whether he actually came in. We gave him a very high score, and I'm sure
                    he would have spoken Spanish.</p>
                <p>The women candidates were also very good, and the minority candidates, all of
                    them that we looked at. I found a difference in the black candidates. They very
                    often expressed themselves very well orally and not so well in writing. There
                    was some effort to stretch, but I think we got good candidates. I think if those
                    people didn't do well in the Service, it may have been because they did not have
                    the kind of leadership that would say: I've got this guy working for me, I want
                    him to do well, I'm going to make certain that he does a good job.</p>
                <p>When I was in Nigeria, we had one young black woman who had a nervous breakdown
                    up in northern Nigeria. She was there by herself with these Nigerians coming
                    around to her house trying to put the make on her. I think her boss was a tough
                    boss, and she just had a nervous breakdown and we had to send her home. She went
                    to another country, and I heard later on that she had been selected out. When it
                    was obvious she couldn't do it up there in the north, she said she wanted to
                    come down and work in the economic section for me, which I thought was nice. I
                    took that as a compliment. But I think that the main problem is not that the
                    people can't do the job. It's that some time when they come in, people don't do
                    enough to make certain that they do a good job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time minority candidates would go through our
                        filtering system, they're obviously top caliber. Was, one, the process too
                        slow to bring them in because there's a lot of competition from commercial
                        businesses or, two, the salary wasn't enough? Was this a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>MARTIN: I don't think we thought that way. If we passed somebody, they were
                    likely to come in, because the black community in particular but other
                    minorities as well liked the idea of serving the government, and they feel more
                    secure with a government job. I suppose there is some leakage, and maybe they
                    never even tried for the Foreign Service because they thought that they wouldn't
                    have a chance. The Service hasn't done well in getting minorities in. They've
                    done extremely well with women. We have plenty of women candidates and they're
                    doing a great job. Their performance is probably comparable to that of men, that
                    you probably can't distinguish too well if you didn't know that the person is a
                    woman. But we haven't attracted enough minority people, and those we have are
                    very often of Asian origin. Giving Asians some kind of preference is ridiculous,
                    because in many cases they put a big stress on education. You may remember
                    somebody who was with us on the board of examiners, Lorraine Takahashi. Her
                    parents were interned during World War II, but she went to the University of
                    Southern California and had a master's degree from the Columbia School of
                    Foreign Service. She was a terrific Foreign Service officer, very disciplined,
                    very good. I thought she was really outstanding, and I think she's done quite
                    well in the Service, too. But I would say that there's still a need to do more
                    for minorities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we're talking particularly the blacks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Yes, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Hispanics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: A problem with the Hispanics is that there is a cultural difference
                    between Hispanics and what the Foreign Service is looking for. It is not
                    unbridgeable but, for example, I remember we were trained very carefully, we had
                    very good training in the Board of Examiners on what to look for in a group
                    exercise, and I remember it was a six-person exercise. We had two women, two
                    white males, and two Hispanics in an exercise one time. The two Hispanic guys,
                    who were from Texas and fairly well educated, smart and all that, wouldn't talk
                    to the women. They were listening to the other men and to each other, and they
                    were ignoring the women. It was quite obvious that there was some kind of a
                    cultural gap between these Hispanic guys and the women candidates. I think that
                    probably hurts them in the service as well, and you can train people out of
                    that.</p>
                <p>I've just done a case recently, a privacy act case. I saw a guy's file, and it's
                    obvious that some people have said negative things about him, they're always
                    women. He's Hispanic, and they talk about his manner towards women, and I'm sure
                    that's it. In the only case I've seen of sexual harassment, where a guy really
                    got in trouble, he was Hispanic. The woman that he was harassing was a white
                    female. I do think there is a cultural difference between the Hispanic and the
                    general Foreign Service community that sometimes causes trouble.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>I was on the Board of Examiners a long time. I liked it. It was obvious I liked
                    it. People liked me, and I accepted the system. I could make some suggestions, I
                    think, for changing the system, but the basic idea of this all-day assessment
                    was a very good one. The suggestions I might make would be to put more emphasis
                    on the written exam and on specialized knowledge that people will need. We had
                    trouble judging people's motivation, and now they've changed that. They try to
                    judge motivation in a different way from before. They try to pass people and
                    then they give them a high pass or a low pass based on a further interview that
                    can go into depth. They try to see whether these people are motivated and get
                    them to show they are motivated if they've studied international affairs or some
                    other field motivating them to come into the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>I also did examining of security officers. I thought that the Bureau of
                    Diplomatic Security did not do a very good job of picking people to be
                    examiners. When they needed somebody, they said, “Hey, you, why don't you go
                    over today?” So there was a big disparity in what these people thought they were
                    looking from ours. I remember we had one fellow who was fairly high ranking in
                    the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, and he was judging people on whether he
                    thought that eventually they would be able to negotiate in a hostage situation
                    with the local government and some terrorist and the security officer and the
                    ambassador all involved. That was an impossible standard. He was flunking
                    everybody and unless there was some kind of adverse impact against minorities or
                    women, we were really supposed to go along with that. Another person was saying,
                    “Oh, this guy would be okay going around doing the security investigation
                    updates.” He could work in what they call WFO, the Washington Field Office,
                    calling people up and say, “Do you think this person is a good American or
                    not.”</p>
                <p>At the end in the Board of Examiners, they picked me, and I was happy to do it,
                    to go over to the Department of Commerce. There, I ran an assessment program for
                    one years' candidates in the Foreign Commercial Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was what? '84 to </hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>MARTIN: This would have been '83. I went to Spain. We did some assessing there,
                    and some others went to the Far East and did some assessing Singapore. That
                    worked out very well. I got along very well with the head of the Foreign
                    Commercial Service. I was over complement. I know they would have been willing
                    to give me a job in the Department, but I did not want that. I wanted to go
                    overseas, and the head of the Foreign Commercial Service offered me a job as
                    commercial counselor in Yaound�, Cameroon because they wanted to have somebody
                    in a post in West Africa, an underdeveloped area. The Secretary of Commerce had
                    gone to West Africa, and he said we should have a presence here, and it should
                    be a regional presence. So the job was offered to me, because Cameroon at that
                    time was the only country in West Africa that could get ten-year money from the
                    banks and was doing quite well. I had somebody working for me in Douala, the
                    port and commercial center. I used to go there about once a week, and we had
                    trade missions coming through. My area covered all of West and Central Africa,
                    so I went to neighboring countries, for example, Equatorial Guinea. We didn't
                    have very much trade with them, but I paid a visit there and as far as the Congo
                    and Brazzaville Congo (Old French Congo).</p>
                <p>Gabon was the next country over and I went there. The concept of a regional
                    officer, comes to anybody's mind, when they start thinking about having people
                    overseas. But ambassadors, however, are very nervous about anybody with regional
                    responsibility that includes their country unless they're assigned to that
                    country. The ambassador to Gabon, I thought, was trying to sabotage me. He
                    really didn't want anybody coming from another post to where he was the
                    ambassador. Very often you have that. That's a problem that the Foreign Service
                    is going to have to overcome, because the wave of the future is to have posts
                    that are regional. We don't need an ambassador necessarily in Equatorial Guinea,
                    and we haven't had in the past. Usually it was some other ambassador, like the
                    ambassador in Cameroon who was also accredited there. It was a place where you
                    wanted to have an ambassador because sometimes things were happening there.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Cameroon. Again -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>MARTIN: I was there from '83 to '85. My career was winding down. I was due out in
                    '86. I was trying to stay as long as possible. I left Yaound� in October 1985
                    and went back to Washington and rejoined the Board of Examiners, but just for a
                    month. I retired January 31, 1986. Before I retired, the Department of Commerce
                    asked me to be on its senior promotion board. I had never served on a promotion
                    board. Early in my career I had seen how a board can work sometimes when the
                    head of the board had a program and he wants to put it through. That was when I
                    was on the board of governors of the Officers' Club in Berlin. We had that with
                    the promotion board. A very strong guy who was the head of personnel in the
                    Department of Commerce, and was later fired for sexual harassment, and he went
                    to jail for some kind of dishonesty. He wanted to push through what he thought
                    was right, and it was hard to oppose him, because I was just the guy from State.
                    We had a public member, and two members from Commerce, who were Foreign
                    Commercial Service guys and this guy in charge, who was trying to ram through
                    some of his candidates. I was a little surprised at how somebody like him, who's
                    strong and smart, can run a board. I think that some of the people who came out
                    low-ranked were people that he may not have liked, and some of the people he
                    promoted were people he favored. Still, I think we did a good job, by and
                    large.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to when you were in Yaound�, what were our
                        commercial interests during this mid-'80's period in West Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: Our commercial interests were trying to find something for American
                    business to get into, because we were excluded by the French. This is the old
                    French Africa - not exactly, but anyway, Cameroon used to be called “The
                    Cameroons.” It was a German colony. At the end of World War I, it was taken over
                    by the League of Nations and divided in two. There were the French Cameroon and
                    the British Cameroons. At the end of World War II, there was a plebiscite, and
                    the northern part of the British Cameroons opted to go with Nigeria. Then you
                    had a country that was one-third English-speaking, with a tradition of English
                    in the schools, and two-thirds French-speaking.</p>
                <p>The British, whom I admire very much for their system of indirect rule and how
                    they managed to run an empire with very few people and not putting in much in
                    the way of resources, ran one of the greatest empires, territorially speaking.
                    But they didn't do as good a job in education as the French did, because they
                    didn't try to impose British culture on these people, they just put limits on
                    them. The French actually taught people their language. Anywhere you went in
                    Cameroon, in Gabon, and in the French Congo, people spoke French very well. They
                    spoke correct grammatical French, and they had an idea that the French language
                    was superior to their own language. They called their language mon patois, but
                    they spoke French.</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>The commercial interest we had was to try to find some kind of a niche, because
                    that was all we could do. The currency was tied to the French currency. The
                    currency of West Africa was supported by the French. Because of that, the trade
                    went to France. For an American company to operate there was difficult, unless
                    they were able to somehow find a niche and deal in French. I would advise
                    companies to try to operate through an agent in France or, if they had a
                    subsidiary French company, to let them do it. If they had a really specialized
                    thing that was needed in the country, I advised them to find a French
                    counterpart that they could somehow hook onto. That was the way to piggy back
                    onto a French entity. Just coming straight and doing it was useless. There were
                    three American banks in Cameroon while I was there, and they were really doing
                    very, very little business. They were getting money from the American AID
                    program as some of it somehow found its way into these American banks, financing
                    things. We were trying because there was a need to promote trade with old French
                    Africa, just as there is a need in some other countries where we don't have much
                    trade. You don't need anybody in Canada from the Foreign Commercial Service. But
                    you do need people where it's been missed through the normal trade policies. You
                    need more than trade policies to promote trade. You need trade promotion, and
                    the way to do that is to get into trade fairs, trade missions, and learning
                    about the country and advising people on how they might find some kind of a
                    niche.</p>
                <p>I did meet some American businessmen there. There were people that came through
                    that thought maybe they could find something. The United States has all these
                    agencies that promote foreign tradOPIC [Overseas Private Investment Corporation]
                    and the ExIm Bank, AID programs, and the “Paunch Corps”, i.e., the International
                    Executive Service Corps. But there wasn't a lot that could be done. Still what
                    there was could be the beginning of something bigger.</p>
                <p>There was a fellow who wanted to sell water because in Cameroon people use to buy
                    water from France. Because it was a monopoly, nobody tried to come in and
                    establish a water company that would get water out of the ground, and meet the
                    standards of the water coming from France. I was trying to help him, but when
                    the Cameroonians realized the opportunity, they got into it themselves. They had
                    good water. They had mountains in Cameroon where you had good spring water.</p>

                <p>In another case, I was trying to help a fellow make a movie. He was getting close
                    to 40, and he ran a movie theater. I asked him what were the most popular movies
                    that he showed because there was a big movie inventory in Douala. He used to
                    come in from this little place where he was a chief, and get movies for his
                    movie theater. The Kung Fu movies, marital arts, he said those were knockout
                    movies as everybody loves them. Because of his interest in the movies, he wanted
                    to make a movie, and I was trying to help him. I went to visit the International
                    Executive Service Corps in Stamford, Connecticut and they said they were ready.
                    They had a guy who was going to come over, we just needed $80,000. To this
                    fellow, I said, “If you can get the $80,000, I can get the guy to come over and
                    live here and help you make that movie.” It was going to be basically a
                    travelogue. It was going to be two people coming from France, a young couple,
                    and they were going to meet and eventually fall in love while they went around
                    Cameroon and saw these different things. Again, in Cameroon, nobody ever says
                    no, but it is very hard to get anything done. This guy said he thought he could
                    get the $80,000, but it just went on and on and on, and when I left, he still
                    didn't have the $80,000.</p>
                <p>There had been a movie made there a few years before I got there. I don't know
                    whether you saw a movie called Greystoke, about Tarzan. That was made in
                    Victoria, in Cameroon. I went to a restaurant there, and this guy was telling me
                    about Greystoke and about the apes, and he said a lot of apes were in costume,
                    and he was doing an imitation of the apes. And I've since seen a movie about
                    Cameroon called Chocolat, a wonderful movie. You have a feeling, sitting in that
                    theater, that you're in Africa because it's such a slow-moving movie, and it's
                    so bright, the hot sun, and you have a feeling you're in Africa. It's a good
                    movie from that point of view.</p>
                <p>Again, in Cameroon, it's hard to get anything done, especially in trade. We had a
                    number of other projects we were trying to get started, and somehow when you
                    went to the ministry, presented the project, they listened very carefully, but
                    then nothing happened.</p>
                <p>When I came back to Washington, I was on the Board of Examiners for a couple of
                    weeks, and then I retired, and continued for that season on the Board of
                    Examiners, as a retiree. To sum up my Foreign Service career: I think that the
                    Foreign Service is a great institution. I always considered myself very lucky,
                    even at the time that I got in. I thought I did a great job in some places, some
                    places less so. At the end, my career was really going downhill, and that was
                    too bad. But so what?</p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>It would have been nice to be an ambassador. Had I gone into Africa earlier I
                    might have done it. I never had a connection in the Bureau of African Affairs. I
                    would recommend to anybody, and I do, that they consider the Foreign Service,
                    and if they get in, to go to Africa. Other people seemed to be better able to
                    pick a post and get the one they wanted. I was always willing to go wherever
                    they wanted me to go and to do whatever they told me to do. I was not an
                    economist but spent my career doing economic work. I'm not a businessman - I
                    have no business sense - but I spent a lot of time promoting trade. I'm not an
                    investigator, but I did some end-use checks that amounted to investigation, and
                    I think I did a pretty good job. I think I had a good attitude, and so did my
                    wife. I was very lucky to pick a good wife. She actually was brilliant in
                    languages. Wherever we went, she would learn the language. With Turkish she had
                    a little bit of a hard time, but even in Turkey, where I couldn't learn the
                    language though I studied it and did great in the exercises, even in Turkey, she
                    did a great job and learned to communicate with our maid. In Croatia, there were
                    a lot of Hungarians, and speaking Hungarian helped her. People spoke German
                    there, and of course, she had gone to school at the University of Munich, and
                    one of her first languages was French. She loved French, so in Laos we had a lot
                    of French friends. So my wife was a tremendous asset. The new kind of Foreign
                    Service wife is offered jobs and my wife fitted right into that. She was happy
                    to work. She worked in Nigeria and also in Cameroon. She was the travel lady. I
                    told her she could get anybody anywhere in the world, providing they started off
                    in Yaound� and finished up in Yaound�. She used to go down to Douala and talk to
                    the travel agents there in French, and she always made friends with the French.
                    She liked the French and always made friends with French-speaking people. That
                    was a lucky break for me, too.</p>
                <p>So I would recommend the Foreign Service to anybody. When I was on the Berlin
                    Task Force during the Cuban Missile Crisis, I was on the fringe, but still,
                    associated with something very major going on. People had that chance. Now the
                    Foreign Service has changed. As somebody said about the army, the army is not
                    what it used to be, and it never was. The same thing is true of the Foreign
                    Service. The Foreign Service has been changing since before 1926, the Rogers
                    Act, '24. But maybe it's no longer an elite service. That's too bad. I think one
                    of the indications you can see, if you look at the obituaries in State Magazine,
                    they're just like a paragraph long and it's almost as if they don't care about
                    the Foreign Service people who have died. They're just given the least
                    acknowledgment they can. One of the dangers that I see - because I see a lot of
                    personnel stuff - is the Civil Service almost taking over from the Foreign
                    Service. When a job is hard to fill, it gets offered to Civil Service people,
                    and retirees. I think the total number in the Foreign Service is probably
                    shrinking, and I don't know what the long-term implications of all that is.</p>
                <p>Another thing is that there are so many different people in international affairs
                    now. You've got the foundations, lobbies, think-tanks, universities, and
                    congressional staffs, all getting into international affairs. It dilutes the
                    importance of the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, very definitely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTIN: And who knows what the long-term implications of that are? If you look
                    now at the people playing a big part in what's going on in the Balkans, it's not
                    so much Foreign Service people. There seem to be some people who have been in
                    the Foreign Service part of their career, but in many cases, it's people who had
                    nothing to do with the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>I retired and became a member of the Washington, DC, Bar. I had been a member of
                    the New York Bar. I did volunteer work for 12 years and just resigned December
                    31st of last year to spend more time with my sister. She was in a nursing home
                    up in Brooklyn and now she's home, and I have to manage her affairs. I'm
                    delaying her income tax because it just was too much for me to do on time. I'm
                    about halfway there, and I'll find something else to do as a volunteer, go to
                    lectures, go to DACOR, do an awful lot of things. I'm a very happy retiree. Some
                    people are very unhappy retired.</p>
