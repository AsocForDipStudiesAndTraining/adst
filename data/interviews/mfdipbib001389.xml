                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is June 20, 2000. This is an interview with Howard
                        H. Lange. This is being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic
                        Studies and Training. I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. Do you go by Howard?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's start at the beginning. When and where were you born
                        and can you tell me a little bit about your parents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: I was born on November 4, 1937 in a small town in Nebraska named Hooper,
                    which is about 40 miles from Omaha. My father and mother had both grown up on
                    farms. My mother moved to Nebraska from South Dakota. They met when my father
                    was going to chiropractic school. I think he was ready to get off the farm. My
                    mother was a nurse. They met and got married in 1926. My sister was born in
                    1927. Then they struggled through the Depression years in small-town Nebraska,
                    which was tough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your father a practicing chiropractor at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think this would be very sparse pickings at that
                        point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: It was indeed sparse pickings. Can I tell a story?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, absolutely. We're trying to get some social history in
                        here, too. Please do.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>LANGE: My mother used to tell a story, which she included in some recollections
                    that she wrote up before she died. In 1930 when the Depression was really
                    beginning to deepen, they moved from one small Nebraska town, Geneva, to
                    another, Hooper. At the beginning of the “dirty thirties,” crops had failed in
                    central Nebraska, and there was very little money in circulation at that time.
                    My father, even into the '40s, had no choice but to take some payments in kind -
                    chickens, canned goods and other commodities. Just before they left Geneva, my
                    mother went around to visit all the people who owed money for treatment. She was
                    very pleased that she managed to collect $100 in cash. The remaining accounts
                    receivable were of course never collected. The drought was less severe further
                    east, around Hooper, but those were very hard years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you father's family come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: His father was the first child to be born in this country to my father's
                    grandparents, who'd come from northern Germany. They came in 1852 to northern
                    Illinois, at that time outside of Chicago but now absorbed by the city. My
                    father's mother's family came from southern Germany in the 1840s, lived in
                    Wisconsin for several years, and stopped in the Nebraska in the 1870s, before
                    most of them moved on to California. The Lange family, father and sons, were
                    farmers and laborers in Illinois. In the late 1870s, the parents and three sons,
                    including my grandfather, moved to Nebraska and bought land from the Burlington
                    and Missouri River Railroad, whose tracks had reached Clay County by 1871.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of a farm?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: It was a general farm. They raised wheat, corn and oats, which before farm
                    mechanization was important as horse feed. I worked on the farm one summer when
                    I was a teenager. There was a pond on the farm, and as a boy I hunted duck there
                    with my father and his friends. The pond is now in federal hands, the “Lange
                    Lagoon Federal Waterfowl Production Area.” We also hunted pheasant in the 1940s
                    and '50s, but wildlife seems less plentiful today as trees in fencerows and
                    shelterbelts have been removed to make way for center pivot irrigation systems.
                    It happens that I still have 80 acres of the farm, which passed from my
                    grandfather to my father to my mother to me. It now raises corn, soybeans, and
                    grain sorghum in rotation year to year. Much of the land around it is irrigated,
                    but I've kept it a dryland farm.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your mother's background?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>LANGE: Her family goes way, way back in this country. Her maiden name was Dawes.
                    The first Dawes in this country came to Massachusetts in 1635 as a 15-year-old
                    boy. And about five generations on, there was William Dawes, a patriot who on
                    April 18-19, 1775, rode with Paul Revere. She was a proud member of the DAR,
                    Daughters of the American Revolution. Her father went from Ohio to South Dakota
                    in the early 1880s, and she grew up on a farm in southeastern South Dakota, just
                    north of the Missouri River.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your mother was a nurse; what sort of education did she
                        get?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: She was a teacher for a short while. At that time, a couple of years of
                    what was called normal college qualified you to do that. She taught in one-room
                    rural schoolhouses in South Dakota for a couple of years. Then she and a sister
                    went into nurse's training in Hastings, Nebraska. Even though she wasn't a
                    full-time nurse after she was married, she kept active at it throughout her
                    life. She was very active in the Red Cross, as a staff member and as a
                    volunteer.</p>
                <p>Q: And your father was a chiropractor. What was the education?</p>
                <p>LANGE: At that time, there were only a couple of chiropractic schools in the
                    United States. The first was the Palmer School of Chiropractic in Davenport,
                    Iowa, and that's where he went. He had earned some money in Chicago and
                    continued to work waiting table during chiropractic school. He completed
                    training in two years, graduating in 1927.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have brothers and sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: I have a sister, who lives near Seattle. Ten years separate us, so in
                    those early years she was sort of a second mother to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it like growing up in Hooper?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Well, first of all I have to tell you that it's pronounced Hoo-per [as in
                    hooker, not blooper]. It is thought to have been named after Samuel Hooper, a
                    post-Civil War congressman from Massachusetts, who had railroad connections.
                    Hooper was a railroad town in the Elkhorn River valley, established in 1871. It
                    is today about the same size it was when I grew up there, which is about 800
                    people. We stayed there until I was through the second grade. Then my father
                    moved us to Lincoln so that my sister could go to university. The only way she
                    could go was to live at home because the family couldn't afford to send her away
                    to school. So from then on I lived in Lincoln.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Lincoln like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Lincoln is the second-largest city in Nebraska, after Omaha. It's much
                    bigger now than when I was there, 120,000 to probably 250,000 now. There were
                    only three public high schools in the whole city at that time. In some ways it
                    was a bit of an insular existence, partly because the country at that time was
                    more insular and less diverse. We had a few black families in Lincoln, some
                    Hispanics, and no Asians at all. Now that's all changed, along with the rest of
                    the country. I spent summers working on the farm or working in town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was school like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: My elementary school and middle school were in walking or biking distance
                    of our house. Even in high school, I often walked or bicycled, though it dawned
                    on me sometime in the first year that bicycling wasn't cool. After that, I
                    mainly walked, a distance of about a mile and a half. I worked in an auto shop
                    one summer. The owner was a family friend, and he sometimes loaned me one of his
                    cars, a very cool 1933 Dodge coupe, so I could drive it to school when I was a
                    senior. In the 1950s, cars were a major teen preoccupation. The auto shop owner
                    also helped me buy and rebuild a wrecked 1950 Plymouth, which I later used to
                    commute from home to classes in my college years. Back to high school, it was
                    pretty big, with a graduating class of 525. Emphasis on sports was heavy, but I
                    was not a successful athlete.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were both in elementary and in high school, what
                        were some of your study interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Beginning early and extending into high school, I had a talent and liking
                    for the sciences and mathematics. I did quite well in them, and my teachers all
                    encouraged me to go into engineering, which was the hot field of the day. They
                    had just started advanced placement courses, and I took college-level
                    trigonometry and did well. I liked writing, and even joined the poetry club, but
                    for some reason never penned a poem. History was not a favorite subject; it just
                    didn't come alive for me at that time. My foreign language was German, but I
                    didn't particularly distinguish myself. So I naturally slipped into engineering
                    when I entered university. It then took me a couple of years to acknowledge that
                    this was not a wise career choice for me. One symptom was that I was sleeping in
                    my classes, especially engineering. So at that point I switched to liberal arts
                    and picked the only major that would still permit me to graduate in four
                    yearpsychology. I had some interest in the subject, but I didn't do especially
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were your reading habits? Were you much of a reader
                        early on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>LANGE: I guess I was, certainly compared to the present generation, which has
                    television and other distractions. You did a lot of things to take up your time
                    otherwise. I always liked reading, but I yielded to distractions; I wasn't a
                    voracious reader.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to university?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: The University of Nebraska.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, while you were in Lincoln, did politics
                        intrude at all? I was wondering whether the state government made any impact
                        at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: It's too bad that I didn't pick up on the interest that my father
                    obviously had in politics. I can remember hearing him railing about national
                    political figures. I didn't hear much about local politics, but perhaps because
                    I wasn't tuned in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you father and your mother come out on the
                        political spectrum?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: My father was certainly pretty solidly Republican, fairly conservative. I
                    don't know how he came to look at things later in life, when he seemed to have
                    less political passion. During the McCarthy era, he was pretty much persuaded
                    that McCarthy was on the right track. He was fooled along with a lot of other
                    people.</p>
                <p>Q: The Midwest was always McCarthy's strongest place. It was prone to sort of
                    latent isolationism I suppose.</p>
                <p>LANGE: Yes. He didn't like FDR. He had a strong impulse toward populism, and he
                    didn't trust the rich. He had little use for those born to privilege. He didn't
                    care much for Truman or Acheson either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the outside world? The Cold War
                        was shaping up; Korea started. There were things going on. Did that intrude
                        at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: In an unusual way. I can't say that I was interested in geopolitics at all
                    at that age. But I had a cousin who was a conscientious objector. In fact it
                    went beyond that. Not only was he a conscientious objector but he refused to
                    register for the draft. In those days there were penalties for that; in his
                    case, it resulted in prison. That gave me a quick lesson in some aspects of
                    national policy and the Korean War. I think I reflected on those types of issues
                    more than many of my contemporaries did.</p>

                    '55-'59, you still had a lot of Korean War vets going to school. And they
                    certainly added a new element, a sort of awareness of the world outside Nebraska
                    that wouldn't have been there otherwise. But I can't really say that I had a

                    coverage, and the Herald in turn fell short of the Des Moines Register. The
                    Register reflected a more sophisticated and aware point of view. At one time or

                    1955, my last year in high school. So it was radio or the Lincoln Journal,
                    neither of which offered much international news. On the other hand, I was
                    rather clueless; I didn't miss it.</p>

                    math credits to get a minor in that. I don't remember a great deal about my
                    psychology course work. I never applied it; as soon as I graduated, I was into
                    other things. Freud and Jung were big names in clinical psychology and
                    psychiatry, though undergrads had to spend a lot of time laboring in the fields
                    of experimental psychology. Skinner was one of the big names in that field.</p>

                <p>Q: You graduated then in 1959. What happened?</p>
                <p>LANGE: Well, two things. First I had a shot at graduate school. I had gone
                    through ROTC so I was committed to go into the Air Force, but I toyed with the
                    idea of delaying that. I took some courses in educational psychology. It was
                    deadly; I couldn't stand it, especially the education component. So I became
                    resigned to going into the Air Force when they called me up. I had met a girl
                    during a summer job in the state of Washingtoa lakeside lodge on the Olympic
                    Peninsula. I worked at manual labor jobpouring concrete for the new Interstate

                    applied for and surprisingly got a job with the Boeing Airplane Company even
                    though they knew that I was ripe for getting my military active duty orders,
                    which I guess was a measure of how their business was booming. They were just
                    hiring anybody. Anyway, I did get my active duty orders late that year -
                    December.</p>

                    precisely, but it was a lot longer than I had planned. My first tour was back in
                    Nebraska, just 50 miles from home, and that was a disappointment. You know,
                    “Join the Air Force and see the world”. I reported to Offutt Air Force Base
                    outside Omaha.</p>

                </p>

                    an important base at that period of time. I was in kind of an odd branch of the
                    air force, which was the Office of Special Investigations (OSI). We didn't wear
                    uniforms; we did background, counterintelligence, and criminal investigations. I
                    can't really complain about the couple of years I was at Offutt, because I did a
                    lot of local travel, doing background investigations. I learned a good bit about
                    southeast Nebraska, southwest Iowa, and northwest Missouri.</p>

                <p>LANGE: Well, most background work is dry as dust; very little comes of background
                    checks. Of the thousands of leads that I did, I am aware of only one, involving
                    a connection to Cuba, that developed into a counterintelligence investigation.
                    More interesting was the criminal investigation aspect of it, which was a
                    continuation of my education in life, and it cured any notion that I wanted a
                    career in law enforcement. Work in that field fosters a pretty gloomy view of
                    human nature.</p>

                <p>LANGE: While I was in Omaha, most of the investigations had to do with people who
                    were assigned to Strategic Air Command or the base. I also had some temporary
                    assignments at other bases in our region. There were some dramatic cases,
                    including homicides.</p>

                <p>LANGE: Well, it depends where it took place. That determined the jurisdiction,
                    whether it took place on base or off, in which case local authorities had
                    prosecutorial jurisdiction. One example of an on-base incident took place at
                    Offutt. A senior sergeant was shot to death while he was on duty deep within the
                    bowels of Strategic Air Command bunker, and this set off, literally, alarm
                    bells. It was evident from the outset that the fatal wound was self-inflicted,
                    and it turned out, as we were persuaded after interviews and forensic work, that
                    it wasn't a suicide but rather an accident. He was cleaning his weapon and made
                    several classic mistakes: not clearing the weapon, not wiping off excess oil,
                    and pulling back the hammer so he could look down the barrel. You can guess what
                    happened. That was one case where local authorities clearly had no jurisdiction
                    and no interest in investigating.</p>

                        relationships and everything else plus the fact that everything they did was
                        a little bit like one big family, where everybody knew what everybody was

                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>LANGE: Well, it's interesting. Most of the cases, most of the criminal cases were
                    pretty routine, routine in the sense of things you'd run into anywhere at any
                    time. Larcenies, assaults. I can't think of anything that would relate, in a
                    meaningful way, to the sort of tensions that were generated, though I suppose
                    that counterintelligence antennae were more finely tuned that at, say, an Air
                    Transport Command base. Homosexuality was a whole different ballgame at that
                    time; it was thought to raise counterintelligence risks because of the
                    possibility of blackmail. That generated a number of investigations among people
                    with security clearances, which was a high percentage of personnel on the
                    base.</p>

                <p>LANGE: Well that probably wouldn't rise to the level of a formal investigation,
                    unless there were injury. That's the kind of case the Air Force would have kept
                    under wraps, handled by the command structure as a disciplinary matter rather
                    than the OSI as a criminal matter.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LANGE: I wasn't aware of it, not as a lowly second lieutenant. We were sort of a
                    kingdom unto ourselves. The OSI regional commander reported to Washington, not
                    to the base commander or, in the case of Offutt, to the Strategic Air Command.
                    This central command structure for investigations was mandated after an infamous
                    case in the late '40s or '50s, in which a local commander quashed an
                    investigation for personal reasons. I suppose that my bosses may have felt some
                    additional pressure because of the high profile of SAC, but at the working
                    level, the pressures we felt were similar to those in many jobs, such as the
                    unrelenting caseload. This was before copy machines so we had a typing pool. We
                    must have had 15 to 20 girls in the pool, and all they did from dawn to dusk was
                    type reports, in multiple copies, using carbon paper. It's easy to forget about
                    those dull, routine jobs.</p>

                    to see the world. So out of my disappointment, I began looking for a more
                    adventuresome assignment, and fate played a hand. At that time, I thought that I
                    just wanted to fulfill the obligation of my officer commission and get out after
                    four years of service. In college, ROTC had paid for pilot training at the local
                    airport. I got a private pilot's license, and I was supposed to go to Air Force
                    pilot training. But that would have entailed a five-year service commitment,
                    which I thought at the time was too long, so I managed to get out of pilot
                    training. Anyway, after a couple of years at Offutt, I was looking for a foreign
                    assignment, and I picked out those that required language training that I could
                    get into quickly and that had short tours on the other end. I applied for Arabic
                    or Chinese. Thank God they picked me for Chinese. Perhaps Arabic would have been
                    alright, but I was glad that I was heading for the Chinese-speaking part of the

                    detachment of OSI, which consisted of me and a local assistant. The fundamental
                    function of the air station was to keep F-100s in two hangars on constant alert.
                    The air station was dedicated to supporting their mission, which was

                    there, and they ran a tightly controlled regime that was still under martial
                    law. They kept secrets and there was full cooperation at the policy and
                    operational levels.</p>
                <p>There was also another facility at the base, and that was Air Asia. Air Asia was
                    the parent of Air America (or was it the other way around?), which you probably
                    remember from Vietnam War days. The company had an amazing facility on the base.
                    They maintained everything from old C-45s and C-46s up to a Convair 880 and
                    F-105s coming back from mission in Vietnam. The 880 belonged to Civil Air
                    Transport, CAT, and it was the only aircraft that the airline had to run all of
                    its international schedules. It would come in every two weeks for maintenance,
                    arriving Friday night and out by Monday morning, having been overhauled in those
                    55 hours or so. It was a very impressive facility with a wide range of aircraft.
                    It was also sort of a precursor to the coming technological transformation of
                    Taiwan. A handful of expats were efficiently transferring skills and knowledge
                    to a very able local work force. It was an interesting place.</p>

                    covered Kaohsiung, south of Tainan, which was a liberty port for the navy. I had
                    a certain amount of business down there in the criminal area. I kept in regular
                    contact with the local authorities including not only civilian and military law
                    enforcement, but the political structurthe mayor's office and so forth. There
                    was some criminal investigatiolarceny at the PX, extortion and fraud at the NCO
                    and officers clubthat sort of thing. I also investigated there the perfect
                    murder.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, what was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: A couple and their two kids had been transferred from Japan; he was an Air
                    Force civilian employee, she was Japanese by birth. He had a mistress in Japan
                    that he intended to bring to live with them. He maintained that this was
                    consistent with tradition in Japan. She stewed over it for a couple of months.
                    One day he took a trip to Taipei to file papers to bring the other woman from
                    Japan. When he returned and walked in the front door, she shot him with a deer
                    rifle. When he slumped to the floor, she told me in a statement, he said, “I'm
                    dying!” “That's right,” she said, and shot him again. It was a messy
                    investigation in more ways than one. Our ambassador, Jerauld Wright, a retired
                    Navy admiral, insisted on a report on his desk first thing Monday morning. The
                    homicide took place late Friday night, but I managed to make the deadline. I was
                    investigator, photographer and everything else. But it wasn't a perfect
                    investigation, and it was criticized by my headquarters. It lacked photos from
                    certain angles prescribed in the manual, and it blotted my copy book with OSI.
                    In any case, we proceeded with the investigation, sent the evidence to an Army
                    lab in Japan for ballistics, fingerprints and all that. It was an airtight case,
                    and she made no bones about it: “I did it!” She really did expect to be hung at
                    dawn from the nearest yardarm. But she wasn't. It presented a policy problem,
                    which is why the ambassador was so anxious to deal with it. Although the crime
                    occurred off base, he didn't want to cede jurisdiction to the Chinese
                    authorities out of concern for precedent. The Chinese did not want to press the
                    point, since no Chinese citizen was involved. But under U.S. federal law, murder
                    is not a crime, and no U.S. local or state authority had jurisdiction. In short,
                    no U.S. authority could prosecute the case. Strictly unwittingly, she had
                    committed the perfect crime. She got a ticket to New Mexico, where her husband's
                    parents, the kids' grandparents, lived. We even had to return her property,
                    including the rifle. She later wrote to me complaining that the rifle had been
                    damaged! It was bizarre!</p>

                    obviouthere were highly educated Mainlanders who came in. They had political
                    power but no economic power, so they promptly instituted land reform,
                    compensating the former landowners with stock in state corporations and creating
                    a new class of capitalists. But what's often ignored is that the Japanese put in
                    place a pretty solid infrastructure.</p>

                        Taiwanese by the ruling government of that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Any sort of dissident political action was very sub rosa; at least it was
                    hidden from my view. The limits to political expression were strict,
                    well-understood and institutionalized, so overt repression was unnecessary. My
                    assistant was Taiwanese. He had, in fact, as a teenager during WW II done forced
                    labor in Japan and he spoke fluent Japanese. He had no love for Mainlanders, and
                    sometimes he pushed the envelope. We would go on a call and sometimes, even in a
                    military officand the military was a very Mainland institutiohe would address
                    someone out of hearing of the others in Taiwanese, not Mandarin. At that time,
                    that was really bold. You wouldn't be arrested for something like that but you
                    would certainly be fingered as someone worth watching. I thought he was taking a
                    chance, but he was in a small way asserting a Taiwan identity. I could never
                    tell how, but he knew when he dated use Taiwanese, and he was never wrong. The
                    situation is totally different now. Taiwanese is becoming the lingua franca even
                    in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which was the last bastion of Mainlander
                    dominance in the government. With the advent of Taiwan born presidents, the
                    shift to Taiwanese has occurred in the President's Office. In the 1960s,
                    Taiwanese of a certain age, when they were in their cups, would sing Japanese
                    drinking songs, including military songs. So it was an interesting cultural
                    mix.</p>

                <p>LANGE: Well, after I got this unfavorable comment on my investigative performance
                    in the “perfect murder” case, I was sort of soured on an Air Force career. I
                    learned more about the episode while reviewing my file in Washington en route to
                    my next assignment. (There was no requirement at the time for raters to discuss
                    evaluations with those they were rating.) My boss in Taipei, a lieutenant
                    colonel, unbeknownst to me had chosen to protect his career rather than defend
                    my performance. That deepened my dissatisfaction with a military career. I was
                    reassigned to an office in downtown Chicago, which did only background checks.
                    Essentially I was doing the same thing I had been doing four years previously,
                    in Nebraska. So I decided it was time to make a break and considered graduate
                    school or law school.</p>

                        anti-Vietnam demonstrations? What was the spirit of the campus at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Definitely. Anti-war sentiment was very strong on campus. The UW had
                    managed, through its Far Eastern and Russian Institute, to capture Cold War
                    money that the DOD was funneling into those programs at the time. George Taylor
                    was a senior professor and had been instrumental in establishing the Institute.
                    He had co-authored with Franz Michael a survey textbook, The Far East in the
                    Modern World. He taught by choice an introductory undergraduate lecture class of
                    100 or more. Many of these kids (I was over 30) were openly hostile and
                    disrespectful, and that really reflected the mood of the times. They dismissed
                    him as an apologist. I thought that he merited a hearing and a degree of
                    respect, but he was very supportive of the government and its efforts, and this
                    was definitely out of favor. Five of us in graduate school shared a housthree of

                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Well, two of them became academics. They were genuine scholars. (I don't
                    consider myself a scholar.) These were the two younger guys. One was a language
                    phenomenon, truly gifted, and he became a professor in philology. The other one
                    went to law school and is now dean of the University of Hawaii Law School. A
                    third dropped out of school and for a while was selling books at an SDS
                    bookstore. He has been teaching English in Japan for several years, and he
                    recently married. Two others became teachers; one lives on Lanai and another in
                    Hilo, Hawaii. (I know this adds to more than five, but I was there 2 � years,
                    and I had different housemates at different times.) Another roommate, Bernie,
                    who is my age and like me has a military background, became a good friend, and
                    we are still in touch. He was a Fulbright scholar in Korea, then a foreign
                    correspondent, later bought a newspaper in Maine, and he's now in partnership
                    with another guy, putting out a sailing magazine in Maine. In the 1970s, we
                    happened by chance to turn up in Manila at the same time, and we built and
                    sailed a 26-foot sailboat.</p>

                    caught me wrong-footed. I mentioned earlier that when I was stationed in Taiwan,
                    Kaohsiung was a U.S. Navy liberty port, and I had certainly seen the seamier
                    side of liberty. One of the questions put to me in the oral was, “You're a vice
                    consul in some city where an aircraft carrier is coming in for liberty. How do
                    you plan activities to prepare for this?” I froze up. All I could think of was
                    the bars and red light districts; i.e., how liberty really happens in most ports
                    in the Far East, but that clearly was not something a U.S. vice consul should
                    plan for. I can't even remember what I answered, but I'm sure that the panel
                    didn't give me high marks. I do remember that I thought how ironic that I would
                    get this sort of a question. I should have been prepared to answer it. I was

                    that I had not exactly bowled them over. I don't know why he did that, but it
                    certainly didn't boost my self-confidence. As I was approaching the end of the
                    master's program, I was weighing my next step, perhaps more graduate school. At
                    this time, the offer of a foreign service appointment came, and here lies
                    another story.</p>
                <p>As I was to learn later, the State Department handled the question of service in
                    Vietnam somewhat differently at different times. My appointment letter was
                    conditional: it asked if I would be interested in accepting an appointment with
                    the understanding that Vietnam would be my first assignment. I thought, “How
                    about that? They're really interested in my Asian experience and expertise!” I
                    really did. Still naive at age 31! If I was a little wiser to the ways of
                    bureaucracies, I would have called somebody in the Department and tried to find
                    out what was going on. Well as it turned out, my incoming A-100 class numbered
                    about 35. Everyone had received that letter, but only five of us had accepted
                    it. Everyone else had turned the deal down and shortly thereafter was offered an
                    unconditional appointment anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came in when? '69? What was your class like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: It was a pretty diverse group for the time, certainly geographically. As
                    far as ethnic and racial diversity, out of the 35, three were black, two Asian
                    American, and one Hispanic. Women were much less represented than they are in
                    today's foreign service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting from youhere you were in the guts of
                        the foreign affairs establishment when you got into your class in 1969. What
                        were you hearing about Vietnam, not from the official pronouncements, but
                        from young foreign service officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: There were passionate feelings among some individuals in the class. I
                    remember we had some off-site training and someone from the director general's
                    office came in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was John Graham wasn't it?</hi>

                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>LANGE: I don't recall the name, but that wasn't it; perhaps it was someone else
                    from the DG's office. Vietnam was a huge personnel issue for the department -
                    that's what some people don't realize. FSOs were resigning or refusing to go to
                    Vietnam. This representative of the DG came to our off-site and spoke about
                    Vietnam, which soon turned into a spirited and sometimes emotional discussion. I
                    remember we had one person, David, who started shouting because he was so
                    strongly opposed to sending foreign service personnel to Vietnam. He saw this
                    problem as one for the power structure, which he considered responsible for the
                    notion that it could be solved militarily. I'm sure all my classmates remember
                    him uttering this: “I want the blood on their hands.” And he pointed at this guy
                    giving the presentation. It was so shocking, not just that someone would feel so
                    strongly, but that he would become part of an institution that he seemed to hold
                    in such low regard.</p>
                <p>Anyway, it was quite an emotional time for some people, particularly those who
                    had decided that they couldn't, in conscience, accept the initial offer of
                    employment and serve in Vietnam. They just didn't want to contribute in any way.
                    I think I was being honest in telling myself it was better to try and have an
                    effect on what was going on than to ignore it. Of course I would also say that
                    if I was just rationalizing, but I really believed it. This clash of attitudes
                    became manifest during my subsequent nine months of training at the Vietnam
                    Training Center (VTC), where you had a real mix of cultures. The range of
                    experience ran from lieutenant colonels who'd already had a tour of Vietnam duty
                    all the way to young Peace Corps alumni who had accepted AID appointments. Some
                    of this latter group very cynically drew their salary, plus per diem for a year
                    of training, then resigned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a very difficult time. Also I think that you were
                        maybe somewhat atypical by having had military experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Yes, the military tradition is to follow orders; otherwise you have chaos.
                    You might not like it, but you do your duty. I had some sympathy for the guys in
                    the military. By contrast, the dominant culture on campus at that time made it
                    your obligation to question authority, even undermine it. I believe that only a
                    handful of us in my A100 class had had military experience.</p>

                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>LANGE: Well it was certainly a serious effort to prepare us for Vietnam. There
                    was a tremendous amount of effort and expense that went into this, divided
                    between language studies and what might be termed “pacification” studies, which
                    drew on history and sociology. All of us were destined for CORDS, which I think
                    stood for Civil Operations and Rural Development Support. The student body was
                    mixed, as I've mentioned earlier. Battles were fought out on the bulletin boards
                    at the VTC. Those of us who were new to the Foreign Service had yet to become
                    acculturated to the foreign service. I remember one episode in particular, which
                    grew out of fairly widespread outrage in 1970. Dan Strasser wrote about it in
                    the December 1992 Foreign Service Journal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the spring of 1970.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: That's righthe “incursion” into Cambodia. There was at a certain point a
                    petition, in the form of a letter to Secretary Rogers, which became known and
                    available for signing. Again, this is a measure of my naivete - I was one who
                    signed it thinking that this would really get people's attention within the
                    Administration because we at the VTC were committed to go to Vietnam. And I was
                    thinking it was an internal document, which was foolish in retrospect because
                    petitions are petitions, and this was a highly emotional subject. It was leaked
                    and became public immediately, and it was embarrassing to the State Department,
                    which was struggling as always not to be marginalized by the Nixon/Kissinger
                    White House. There was subsequently a meeting called for the Foreign Service
                    Officers who had signed it. It was chaired by Undersecretary U. Alexis Johnson,
                    and it served to demonstrate the gap that existed between his level and those of
                    us at the junior level. He discussed loyalty and the duty to support
                    presidential policy. We argued that Cambodia was an extraordinary decision,
                    taken in secrecy and against the public will, would widen the war to little
                    purpose, and required an extraordinary response. At one point he chose an
                    unfortunate turn of phrase, referring to the dissent channel as the appropriate
                    channel in which to express differences with policy. If the petition signers had
                    instead put their views into a dissent channel message, he said, “no one would
                    have thought anything about it.” His meaning was that we wouldn't have so upset
                    the Administration; i.e. Nixon. But it came across quite differently, as an
                    inadvertent verification that the dissent channel was ineffectual and thus an
                    implicit argument for the petition. Someone blurted out, interrupting Johnson's
                    presentation, “Of course, that's the point!” So he failed utterly to persuade
                    members of the group that they had erred. He quickly adjourned the meeting, I
                    felt more in sadness than in anger. He later wrote of the meeting in his memoirs
                    that it was “not a happy occasion.” This petition episode continued to cause
                    anguish, in the Department and in the White House. Nixon from time to time asked
                    for the list of signers, and his staff kept trying to obtain it. He wanted to
                    make the signers pay. Rogers locked the list in his office safe, and it was
                    never “found.” AFSA (the American Foreign Service Association) eventually
                    secured assurances that no formal or informal disciplinary action would be taken
                    against the signers. The petition was a product of the passions of the time. But
                    if it wasn't for Johnson and Rogers, I could have had a very short career.</p>

                        feel that way, why don't you get out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: No. Johnson's was the only effort to talk to us about it. I know now from
                    his memoirs that he thought that firing us was not advisable in part for
                    political reasons, because it would have intensified the public reaction against
                    the incursion. He knew that releasing our names to the White House would have
                    been the end for us, and that freezing our promotions or keeping us from
                    postings to Southeast Asia, as he promised Nixon he would do, could not be
                    squared with the rules by which we operate. Surely a lot of people are upset by
                    the episode, then and nobelieve that it went beyond the bounds of responsible
                    dissent, and that we should have resigned or been cashiered. I don't agree, and
                    apparently Rogers did not agree, perhaps because the letter/petition was
                    addressed to him. Or perhaps he and Johnson simply believed that firing us would
                    have exacerbated their own problems. The violation of trust, of course, lay in
                    leaking the petition for public consumption, and that probably involved just one
                    or a handful of people. In any case, the name list was never made public, and I
                    was never confronted, either officially or informally by colleagues.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LANGE: No, I don't know how it originated. Johnson wrote that 50 of the 250
                    signers were Foreign Service Officers, but I've not been able to find out who
                    started it. I never saw the full list, and I know personally of only a few of
                    the signers. At least two of those went on to be ambassadors, and one is
                    currently an ambassadoin Southeast Asia, by the way.</p>
                <p>Our discontent about Vietnam policy found other expressions. In 1970, about five
                    of us in training who were really concerned and upset by a number of issues
                    formed a study group. We had meetings with different people to discuss the
                    issues. We tried to reconcile in our own minds what we were doing. Were we
                    making a contribution to a bad cause? Or could we influence positively something
                    we thought was seriously wrong? I recall one meeting with Averil Harriman in his
                    Georgetown home. It was very heady stuff, sitting under his Renoirs and
                    discussing high policy. He said a very nice thing at the end of our session:
                    that we were making a significant contribution to the country by serving in
                    Vietnam. Whatever he felt about the waand he knew how to keep his own counsethis
                    assurance did encourage me to think that maybe what I was doing had some
                    value.</p>

                        was Consul General in Saigon the spring of 1970 when the incursion in
                        Cambodia came. And it really wasn't, even among the junior officers who were
                        there, maybe some eyebrows quivered or something like that, but it seemed
                        that maybe it made some sense. We'd seen the results coming. It was a
                        Washington phenomenon - not a Washington phenomenon, you see Kent State and
                        all that - but at least I don't recall any great outcry. Were you having any

                    doubts about our policy when I accepted the conditional appointment. I accepted
                    it knowingly, and I never considered reneging on my commitment. I thought there
                    was room for loyal opposition, for trying to change things from within. We
                    thought it important for Rogers and others to know how Vietnam policy,
                    particularly an apparent decision to widen the war in Cambodia, looked to some
                    of us who were in fact on our way to Southeast Asia. Amidst all of the events
                    that aroused passions during that period, it would be difficult to know if the

                <p>LANGE: I went first to Hue. When we arrived in Vietnam, we had some orientation
                    in Saigon. We had a meeting with William Colby, who was in charge of the
                    “pacification” program. We had this notion that during this meeting with Colby,
                    we were entitled to express our assignment preferences within country. He must
                    have been impressed with our Chutzpah, but he didn't express any annoyance. He
                    had the weight of a lot of problems on his shoulders, and he would have been
                    entitled to put things in perspective for us. This illustrates that we still
                    didn't quite appreciate the reality of what was happening on the ground in
                    Vietnam. We knew a lot about the Vietnamese culture and language and all that,
                    but the connect between that and what was actually taking place hadn't quite
                    been made. We knew something of the big picture, but we were soon to learn about
                    the little picture.</p>
                <p>I was assigned to Hue, which was an interesting place. That was only a couple of
                    years after the Tet Offensive in 1968, which was so devastating in Hue. The mood
                    among the Vietnamese was still very much one of apprehension. Emotionally, they
                    remained hunkered down. The central Vietnamese are a little more reserved
                    anyway. With Tet 68, many had withdrawn into a shell. We had a Vietnamese
                    assistant in the Hue City advisory office who took some pains to limit the
                    number of Vietnamese who knew that he worked for the Americans. He reasoned,
                    correctly, that the fewer who knew, the less likely he was to be denounced as a
                    collaborator and counterrevolutionary if the city again fell under Viet Cong or
                    North Vietnamese control. In 1968, many of such people had been taken to the
                    countryside and executed.</p>
                <p>Some members of the advisory team had been captured or killed in 1968. I lived in
                    a house that had been occupied by one who was killed, and there were still a
                    couple of bullet holes inside the house. The maid stayed on at the house, and
                    she erected a small shrine on the north side of the house to propitiate the
                    angry spirits still about.</p>
                <p>I didn't spend much time on our military bases. I did see our kids driving
                    through town in their military vehicles. Based on that occasional contact alone,
                    it seemed to me that morale and discipline were very iffy. This was the era of
                    “fragging” incidents, and there were persistent stories about drug use.
                    Incidents in Hue involving U.S. soldiers were rather frequent. During traffic
                    backups at the approaches to bridges over the Perfume River, Vietnamese
                    “cowboys” would steal from Americans in their vehicles; shootings ensued. In the
                    countryside, American soldiers reportedly shot, maliciously and randomly, water
                    buffalo from the roadside, which was of course a terrible thing to do,
                    disastrous to the livelihood of the owner. People-to-people relations were not
                    good.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>There was in early 1971 an incursion by regular Army of Vietnam (ARVN) units into
                    Laos, an operation that was named “Lam Son 719.” It was an attempt to disrupt
                    North Vietnamese supply lines, but it was a disaster. Armored units rumbled
                    through Hue in the dead of night headed for Laos and limped back not long
                    thereafter. It was meant to be an ARVN operation, but it came to depend heavily
                    on U.S. air support. A lasting image was a photo, carried the U.S. press, of
                    ARVN soldiers desperately clinging to the skids of Huey choppers as they escaped
                    the fighting. So it was a pretty grim atmosphere in many respects.</p>
                <p>The security in the province right around Hue wasn't so bad, but the westernmost
                    district was mountainous and provided sanctuary for the Viet Cong. Our advisory
                    team in that western district was quartered in a bunker. From that district, we
                    once a month got exactly three rockets into the city just to remind us that the
                    Viet Cong was out there, and this obviously kept people on edge.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: There were two of us on the Hue City advisory team, and I was also
                    economic advisor on the province advisory team. In retrospect, much of our
                    activity was meaningless. For example, I did studies on potential for tourism
                    and for handicraft industries using the indigenous bamboo. This was stuff that
                    was interesting to do as an economic development person, but we had no chance of
                    getting it off the ground without conditions of peace and security.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hue had, of course, suffered badly during the Tet
                        Offensive, when the city was taken over by the Viet Cong. Was it the Viet

                </p>
                <p>LANGE: It was the North Vietnamese Army that took the city, though VC agents in
                    the city surfaced thereafter and helped to identify targets for purges, and
                    worse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A lot of people were taken out and killed. Was there a
                        serious gap in the intellectual, administrative structure of people who'd
                        been killed?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>LANGE: One figure is a total of 2,800 killed. A first wave of executions, after
                    the NVA established control, focused on civil servants, teachers and religious
                    leaders. Subsequent purges were aimed at community leaders, intellectuals and
                    those connected with the U.S. You can imagine what this did to the social and
                    political infrastructure. The civilian apparatus was pretty much gutted; it had
                    all been militarized by the time I arrived. All the provinces acquired military
                    governors. We had a good one the year I was there, Colonel Than. But there were
                    stories about his wife, and in fact there were stories about most ARVN military
                    wives at that time, who were making the most of the short time they had to
                    insure the future of their families. I think our province chief was more honest
                    than most; his wife was probably average. The populace was just trying to
                    survive. They didn't have many illusions about their government or political
                    leadership. We would get upset because, for example, in one of the programs to
                    construct community facilities, they had mixed a lot of sand with the cement to
                    make concrete so they could sell the leftover cement. Of course the concrete
                    didn't hold together. So the projects were often falling apart, literally! But
                    the Vietnamese were probably acting quite rationally in those circumstances,
                    where the future was totally uncertain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought it would have been sort of difficult
                        to work up enthusiasm for doing the things you were doing, with the
                        situation being such that the future was not really sure. You didn't know
                        where things were going, and the idea of looking at tourism and crafts and
                        all that. I don't want to say rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic, but at
                        least it was certainly an uncertain future. Was that the feeling or did you
                        feel that things were moving ahead?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: I guess the concept most of us had was that we were acting on a
                    contingency basis; nothing was going to be possible unless there was some
                    certainty about the future, which there was not at that time. The best you could
                    hope for was to identify some opportunities that could be put in place as it
                    became possible to do so. Some of the guys on the team were more cynical than
                    others, but most of us were just trying to do our best to make something work.
                    Certainly the military guys, they were busting their chops trying to train the
                    regional forces. And maybe there was some residual benefit. At least it would be
                    nice to think so. I haven't been back for a visit, but I understand that tourism
                    is flourishing in Hue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for how the people in Hue felt about
                        the Thieu government, the government down in Saigon?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>LANGE: Well, there was a lot of unhappiness within the Buddhist community. In
                    fact, we tried to maintain contact with the leaders, because they felt that ever
                    since the Diem government of the early '60s, Saigon didn't have their interests
                    at heart. I don't know if there was any feeling about Thieu that was different
                    there than in any other part of the country. I think a deep-seated resignation
                    had set in that no matter who was in the presidency, they wouldn't have much
                    chance to survive. Elections certainly didn't fire people with much enthusiasm
                    for any particular candidate. I think most individuals in Hue were fatalistic.
                    The psychological climate was negative and depressed, and the physical
                    environment reinforced that. One of Diem's villas on the outskirts oHue had been
                    destroyed at one point, possibly in '68, and it remained a bombed-out hulk. The
                    former U.S. consulate, closed after it was damaged in Tet '68, was occupied by
                    squatters. People had little faith in Saigon's ability to defend them, as they
                    showed when they jammed the roads to the south during the Easter 1972 NVA
                    offensive.</p>
                <p>I have some notes from my first year in Vietnam, in Hue. They pick up in January
                    '71, so it was soon after I arrived, which was approaching the third anniversary
                    of Tet '68. It was very much on people's minds. Several people in the CORDS
                    program there in Hue lost their lives - nine Americans and five Vietnamese. Of
                    course as we now know in retrospect, the Viet Cong kind of shot their load in
                    Tet '68, but that wasn't obvious in 1971, and there was a lot of anxiety. We
                    still had no clear idea of North Vietnamese or Viet Cong intentions. In January
                    1971, there had been a mining of the railroanot an uncommon occurrencin Phu Loc
                    district, which was about a 30 minute drive south of Hue. It killed nine
                    Vietnamese. Two rockets had landed in Hue over the weekend, but they landed
                    harmlessly in the water. South Vietnamese forces responded with three to four
                    hundred rounds of counter battery fire, which of course was symptomatic of the
                    whole Vietnam scenmassive but militarily ineffective response, undertaken
                    largely for psychological reasons.</p>
                <p>Some early impressions: A) I sensed Vietnamese hostility in Da Nang when I came
                    through en route to Hue. Lee Graham and I had arrived together (he was on his
                    way to Quang Ngai), and as we walked along the river a few blocks from the
                    “White Elephant” headquarters of CORDS for MR two kids on a motorbike ripped his
                    camera off his shoulder. That was typical of petty crime, but they added insult
                    to injury by taunting us as they rode away. B) The U.S. military was at that
                    time in the process of drawing down. Morale was pretty bad. I didn't have a lot
                    of direct contact with the military, but having been in the military, I could
                    see the signs. The kids showed no pride in appearance and they weren't
                    disciplined. I saw written in the dust on the back of a truck in Da Nang, “Get
                    me out of this hell.” C) On the other hand, in Hue, I visited the Tien Mu
                    Pagoda, which is well known, up the river from Hue. It was very peaceful, but
                    with a background of artillery fire in the distance, the overall effect was
                    bizarre. D) There was a wonderful restaurant in Hue, with dining on a veranda
                    over the river. It was a great place to put the ugliness of war out of your
                    mind.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Again, referring to my contemporary notes, we first became aware of Operation Lam
                    Son 719, the incursion into Laos, on January 27th, 1971. We didn't know what was
                    happening at the time, but in the middle of the night the tanks and APCs started
                    rolling through town. We speculated on what it was about, and basically we had
                    it right. It was a last big push to give Vietnamization a better chance. A
                    couple of NSC staff came through at the end of January - Don Webster and Paul
                    Droge. My impression at the time was that they wanted to be hopeful that
                    something could be done about attitudes and about our relationship with the
                    Vietnamese, even at that late date, but that they couldn't shake their
                    skepticism.</p>
                <p>In those early days of my Vietnam assignment, I was preoccupied by what seemed to
                    me the almost universally unpleasant interface between the two cultures - the
                    Americans and the Vietnamese. I was, as were most people who visited Vietnam
                    during that period, particularly dismayed by what the conflict had brought to
                    the country, as evidenced by the prostitutes, hustlers, pimps and thieves. Then
                    there was the despair of our own military, who saw the war in the bitterly
                    memorable phrase as “unwanted and unending, pursued by the unwilling, for the
                    ungrateful”. It was a grim picture. I had a talk with a soldier; I don't know if
                    he was special forces or what, but he'd come down from the hills, had been
                    rewarded for a successful ambush by a trip to Australia. What particularly
                    struck me about this fellow was how he'd become desensitized to loss of life and
                    his part in it. Who knows how he later put it together, but at that time he was
                    proud of the technical aspect of how he had carried out his orders, and he
                    described it to me in very clinical detail.</p>
                <p>By February in 1971, we still didn't know exactly what was happening in Laos.
                    Then I think there was an official announcement about it on February 9. Part of
                    the operation had to do with Vietnamese troops who had been lifted by U.S.
                    helicopters into Laos, four of which had been shot down. As of the third week in
                    February there was a lot of upbeat talk among our military as to the success of
                    the operation. That it was a disaster was soon to become evident.</p>
                <p>In that same month, I went to a local organizational meeting of the Rotary Club.
                    Is this American or what? If we can just help them to establish a Rotary, we'll
                    have the first step down the road toward civil society. This meeting was six
                    months after it had been formed, and there were five Vietnamese and six
                    Americans. The Vietnamese who wanted to carry it forward had been to the United
                    States - not surprising - but there was obvious uneasiness within the Vietnamese
                    group. They talked about having a dinner meeting but noted that security would
                    be a problem. They concluded that they didn't dare get together over dinner. The
                    meeting took place against the backdrop of rumbling and flashes of artillery in
                    the distance.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>There was a memorial service near Hue on February 20, 1971, for the victims of
                    the Tet '68 massacre. It was organized by the government; and Pres. Thieu came
                    up from Saigon to deliver remarks. There were several banners. One said, “It is
                    better to die embracing one another than to have a wandering soul.” Another: “We
                    are encouraged by the president's decision to enter Laos.” The bereaved family
                    members had gathered on one side of the mass grave under a cargo parachute,
                    where microphones amplified their weeping and wailing. Incense burned and food
                    offerings to the deceased included orange soda and French bread. Thieu seemed
                    somewhat awkward; he had senators and generals flanking him, including leading
                    generals of the time - Lieutenant General Quan and Lieutenant General Lam,
                    neither of which made much of an impression on me except for their physical
                    weighunusual for Vietnamese. The thrust of Thieu's address was that the central
                    provinces would never be bargained away in discussions with the north.</p>
                <p>There was an American in Da Nang who was building, as a demonstration to the
                    Vietnamese, a ferro-concrete boat. I visited his project, and he was apparently
                    carrying it forward with some of his own money. This was not common, but it was
                    not unknown in Vietnam. There were Americans such as this one who were so
                    dedicated and so wrapped up in the whole effort that they essentially turned
                    their lives over to their project. He was at the time wrestling with the
                    question of whether he should present the first boat to the local commanding
                    general, to boost his chances of continuing his project with the goodwill of the
                    military.</p>
                <p>In March, 1971, I visited District 2 of Hue, which was one of the poorer
                    districts. It included Hue's boat hamlets - people who lived on boats, were not
                    well educated and really the poorest of the poor. They were believed to be among
                    the first to guide the Viet Cong in their looting during the Tet Offensive. This
                    belief was another manifestation of the distrust and bad feelings existing among
                    the Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>I was particularly upset by a story that was making the rounds in advance of a
                    visit by Ambassador-at-Large Kennedy. He was a former secretary of the treasury.
                    I don't recall his mission, but he reportedly had expressed an interest in the
                    mass graves, and the order was passed to locate some human bones and bury them
                    at the site so they could be discovered during the visit. I don't know if the
                    story was true or not, but it was definitely considered plausible at the
                    time.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>Corruption seemed to be pretty pervasive. It was said that after Tet '68 victims
                    didn't get government benefits unless they paid kickbacks. Even those who did
                    not need assistance were encouraged to make claims so the officials could skim
                    off the top. A teacher told me that a student could pass the high school exam by
                    paying the grader between 300 and 500 Piastres. None of this particularly
                    surprised me, even though I was still relatively idealistic. An account of how
                    things got done came from a Vietnamese businessman. According to him,
                    woodcutters paid a tax to the Viet Cong in order to get their wood out of the
                    forest. Everyone ended up winners: Woodcutters weren't harassed; local officials
                    got their cut because they issued permits to cut the wood; and the market demand
                    for wood for construction purposes was satisfied.</p>
                <p>The psychological effects of the failed operation into Laos started to emerge in
                    April. The son of our assistant in the city advisory office was a helicopter
                    pilot. He couldn't eat or sleep after he came back thinking about the killing he
                    had seen. A barber said that many people died including the brother of a barber
                    who had previously been in the shop. But he said that without U.S. air support
                    it would have been even more of a disaster. Imagine what confidence this showed
                    in Vietnamization of the war. Dan Southerland, an excellent reporter for
                    Christian Science Monitor, became very depressed during this period.</p>
                <p>For some reason, probably because we were advisors to Hue City, we sometimes
                    mediated incidents involving the U.S. military and the local population. There
                    were frequent traffic backups at the bridges crossing the Perfume River. While
                    sitting on the back of a truck at the so-called Railroad Bridge, which carried
                    north-south through traffic, a GI had his watch taken by a kid, and the GI shot
                    him dead. We were expecting a demonstration. We heard reports about the same
                    time from the district south of Hue that GIs on a U.S. truck had fired M-69s,
                    grenade launchers, at some friendly regional forces, killing them, just for the
                    hell of it. Newsmen were coming up from Saigon the next day to look into
                    discovery of some new graves, and we thought they were going to be on to this
                    story. I visited the family of the kid involved in the bridge incident, and they
                    were boat people. The entire family lived on two adjoining boats. His survivors
                    - who were his father and mother, two brothers, five sisters, wife and two
                    children - the family was anxious to show that he had a job, and he was not a
                    thief. They wanted to pass on stories that they heard at the scene that he was
                    just driving his bike. According to one version he wasn't even involved in a
                    theft. But unfortunately he didn't have a very savory record. He had previously
                    had his teeth knocked out when he had fallen from a truck while stealing from
                    it. The family showed no overt hostility, and as it turned out, there were no
                    demonstrations. A full cup of human tragedy, but no demonstrations.</p>
                <p>There really wasn't any terrorism in Hue City. I think that was the case in all
                    sizeable cities in that period; that is, after Tet 68.</p>

                <p>LANGE: In Hue, it was peaceful enough that we once arranged to hire a sampan for
                    the evening. We anchored out in the middle of the river and enjoyed a meal with
                    wine. We could imagine how it used to be without people firing back and forth.
                    But the downtown area was bracketed by two major bridges, and it was clear that
                    most boats didn't dare venture beyond those bridges. Because of that it was
                    impossible to get out of earshot of the loudspeaker at the theater, which was
                    always blaring. And there weren't any other boats out in the river.</p>
                <p>In April 1971, we had a demonstration in Hue. The Buddhists had called the police
                    chief to task for some of his earlier arrests. Then there were counter charges
                    against the Buddhists, including by a group called the “Corps against Communism”
                    for being soft on communism. They alleged that the province chief was soft on
                    Communism, and they even charged that the chairman of the City Council was a
                    Communist sympathizer with well-known Communist associates. I wondered at the
                    time if we were ever going to fight a common enemy.</p>
                <p>On April 17th there was “victory” celebration for the Lam Song 719 operation, but
                    there was precious little to celebrate. Most of the people seemed curious to see
                    gathered officials and military demonstrations. Even at that time, there was
                    deep skepticism that the ARVN had caused any meaningful damage to the supply
                    system of the North Vietnamese, which was the target of the whole operation.
                    That skepticism was well placed.</p>
                <p>In June, I again got involved in mediating a dispute. An American vehicle crashed
                    into a house. No one was hurt, but the confrontation went on all afternoon, and
                    there were plenty of weapons around. I had a U.S. military policeman on one side
                    and a Vietnamese policeman on the other. There was impatience and deep distrust,
                    but eventually, both sides backed off.</p>
                <p>The Vietnamese really had a love-hate attitude toward us. I once took a boat out
                    on the river, and I thought I sensed dislike, even hate. Some people repeated an
                    insult that they had obviously learned from the GI“F___ you!” Then in the next
                    moment I was exchanging waves and smiles with other people onshore. The inner
                    conflict they felt toward our presence was understandable and troubling.</p>
                <p>On one occasion, driving from Hue to Da Nang for the weekend I passed a train
                    that had been blown up the day before. It was loaded mainly with Coke and Pepsi,
                    cases of which were cascading down the embankment. I think that commodities for
                    the GIs were the main cargoes for the railroads at that time. The symbolism
                    could hardly be missed.</p>
                <p>We once had dinner with a group of Vietnamese expatriates living in various
                    places abroad, back for a visit. They reported that not even their relatives
                    were urging them to return to Vietnam for good, and they did not intend to.
                    Another vote of no confidence in Vietnamization.</p>

                <p>I once had a lengthy conversation with me a Mrs. Tuy, who worked in the personnel
                    office in CORDS,. She tried to explain why she continued to be concerned that
                    there could be a repeat of Tet '68. She had 11 children. They had 18 people at
                    their house, when Tet '68 started, and they lost no one. The family took refuge
                    in three different Catholic churches. Family members encountered the Viet Cong
                    or the NVA twice. Once her son was fingered, possibly for execution, but one of
                    his students, who had surfaced as a VC, spoke up for him and he wasn't taken.
                    Another time her son and son-in-law were pressed into labor, but they escaped
                    during an American attack. They finally got to the university apartments and
                    then to Phu Bai, which was an American base south of Hue, and from there to Da
                    Nang. She was very proud of what she had accomplished with her family, giving
                    them all a good education and getting them all through Tet. But she was still
                    very uneasy about the future.</p>

                    possible.</p>
                <p>I took a trip in July 1971 to Quang Dien, which is a very poor district along
                    Highway 1 north of Hue. It's located along a lagoon leading to the Street
                    without Joy, made famous by Bernard Fall's eponymous book. The land is very poor
                    - poorly drained and sandy. Still there are a lot of people trying to make a
                    living. They had once accumulated enough to build concrete houses with tile
                    roofs but those had at one point been so damaged that they were no longer
                    useable. People were living in shacks with tin roofs. Their lives had really not
                    changed very much for generations, except for the added burden since the 1950s
                    of the uncertainty of war.</p>
                <p>There was another a district, Vinh Loc, along the coast southeast of Hue. Since
                    '68 we had characterized it as a pacified area. But in a three-day period in
                    1971, there had been five assassinations with no retaliation and no one coming
                    forward to say who had done it.</p>
                <p>In August there were anti-U.S. demonstrations by students in Hue. The immediate
                    cause was a traffic fatality in front of the University of Hue student union in
                    the afternoon. A student on a Honda had fallen under the wheels of a U.S. tanker
                    truck. It happened that there were activists from Saigon present, so the
                    reaction was almost immediate. Banners were out within a few minutes. A vehicle
                    belonging to RMK (Morrison Knudson) -</p>

                    RMK-BRJ was a consortium of four large international construction firms: R for
                    Raymond International, MK for Morrison-Knudson, BR for Brown and Root, and J for
                    J.A. Jones Co. Anyway, a vehicle belonging to this contractor was burned, and
                    the Vietnamese driver was beaten. There were some other attempts at firebombing.
                    The authorities dispatched some PFPopular Forces, sort of paramilitarieto keep
                    the peace.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LANGE: As I recall, the military hierarchy started at the top with Army of
                    Vietnam main force units (ARVN), under Saigon's command; then Regional Forces,
                    under the province chief; and at the bottom in terms of training and equipment,
                    the Popular Forces under local commanders. Anyway, some Popular Forces were
                    posted at the compound because there were numerous rumors of the imminent
                    arrival of rioters. Tension was pretty high at the compound, but nothing
                    happened. A colleague and I had scheduled a lecture presentation at Hue
                    University - I don't remember what that was on - but that was obviously
                    canceled. One reason that the demonstrations died out was that most of the
                    students were away at military training.</p>
                <p>In September there was another incident at the end of the bridge where a GI had
                    shot and killed a thief. The students were better prepared this time, and we
                    were told they had been waiting for such a cause. Students who had been at
                    military training had been released the day before. Firebombing was attempted on
                    three vehicles, including two military police vehicles and one belonging to a
                    contractor. One truck was burned.</p>

                    quiet in terms of terrorist or guerrilla activity. But the Easter offensive of
                    1972 really shook confidence. Bunker's wife, Carol Laise, was ambassador to
                    Nepal, and Bunker from time to time flew up there on a U.S. military plane.
                    There was a sign-up list in the embassy, and I got on the flight, in April I
                    think. We were there for about 24 hours and had to turn around and come back
                    when we got word of the NVA offensive. The offensive was beaten back, but it
                    seriously shook confidence, especially in the Highlands and in MR I. A couple of
                    times during the year, 1972, I visited MR II. It was a familiar picture: The
                    countryside was pacified in the daytime, but after dark, only the cities were
                    relatively safe.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>I have some contemporary notes, yellowed with age, made after the 1972 North
                    Vietnam offensive — the Easter Offensive. You recall that the Senate Foreign
                    Relations Committee was more influential in those days than it is today. A
                    couple of staffers - Lowenstein and Moose - they used to travel there with some
                    frequency, and their reports were always anticipated either with foreboding by
                    the people who were in the Administration or eagerly by those who were critical
                    of the war. I traveled with them to Hue, Qui Nhon and Pleiku. This was in May of
                    1972, so it was not long after the Easter Offensive. In Hue, which was our first
                    stop, it was quite clear - this is May 26th - it was quite clear that in the
                    early days when the offensive took place that there was a real panic, and most
                    civil servants or professionals abandoned the city. Even the CORDS employees had
                    decamped and stolen three cars from the CORDS compound. There was only one way
                    out, which was the highway south to Da Nang. The general picture was that there
                    was a lack of control, a lack of leadership, with one bright spot. For reasons I
                    can't identify, the national police, who were much criticizedenigrated as the
                    “white mice”, after their uniformhad stayed at their posts and done their job.
                    But overall it was a thoroughly dispiriting demonstration of Vietnamization. The
                    picture was that the Americans, while they were there, managed to pull services
                    together and get the military and the civilians working together, but this had
                    fallen apart during the Easter Offensive. When we arrived, maybe 75% or so of
                    the civil servants had returned. About a quarter of the population as a whole
                    had returned by that time. The hospital was staffed again, but all the big
                    retail stores were closed. A few small shops were open. The big central market
                    near the river had been looted and burned. It was a huge conflagration, and the
                    ruins gave the whole city a shocking aspect. It was obvious that Hue had gone
                    through another terrible time. The only signs of new activity were some
                    decorations and preparations for the celebration of Buddha's birthday, which
                    fell toward the end of May.</p>
                <p>There were numerous refugees who had come in from the northern districts; the
                    estimate of the officials in Hue was 19,000, which was up 5,000 from the weeks
                    previously. More were coming in, because they just didn't have confidence that
                    security was going to hold. In fact, the North Vietnamese at that time still
                    occupied the northern part of Huong Dien, which is one of the northern
                    districts. In Phu Loc District, which is between Hue and Da Nang, the railroad
                    had not been operating since early April; the bridges were out. As for the
                    territorial forces, their performance had been mixed, depending on their
                    leadership. No one was making any predictions as to what the North Vietnamese
                    were going to do at that time, but there was at least some confidence in the
                    defense of Hue by the territorials.The general scene in the city was pretty
                    depressing. Children wandering. The cowboys were everywhere - young kids on
                    their motorbikes looking for prey.</p>

                <p>LANGE: Right. There were very few old people, children or girls. At the
                    university, there were still some radical slogans and posters in evidence from
                    earlier days. Some of the bunkers and guard points had been rebuilt. Trucks and
                    APCs were everywhere. At the city market, the center part was still a ruin;
                    there were some small stalls that had been rebuilt around the perimeter. These
                    were fairly busy in the morning. There was a small black market in foods. There
                    were wreaths and flowers on sale.</p>
                <p>The people we talked to - both civilian and military officials - their families
                    were all out of the city, in either in Da Nang or Saigon. A Vietnamese major
                    said that overall in the city maybe 30 to 40 percent of the people had returned.
                    He thought maybe people would start coming back after Nixon's summit in Moscow.
                    He thought that once it was clear from the Moscow meeting that there was no
                    “sell-out,” which was always what people in the central region were afraid of,
                    that people would start coming back. A civilian said that some families would
                    never come back. His family was in Da Nang and had taken most of their
                    furniture. Everybody was ashamed of the market fire. The offensive was one
                    thing, but the destruction of the market was something that had been carried out
                    by Hue people. Most of the intellectuals - the teachers and the businessmen -
                    had gone, but the Chinese (i.e., Vietnamese-Chinese) had stayed. One person said
                    of the Chinese, “They have nothing to fear from the Communists.”</p>

                <p>LANGE: The offensive had stopped, but some areas were still occupied by North
                    Vietnamese at that time, some distance from Hue. Quang Tri, South Vietnam's
                    northernmost major city and some 35 miles from Hue, I think was back in the
                    hands of the South Vietnamese. But it had been a terrible scene up there in
                    Quang Tri. Air power had played had played a large role in turning back the
                    offensive, but there were the usual mistakes. One of them involved B52s; they
                    had made a mistaken raid on a fire base that was occupied by friendlies. Such
                    events of course added to the general sense of malaise and depression.</p>

                    going to like what you hear.” In other words, he was previewing a very upbeat
                    picture of the military situation. This sort of confrontational meeting between
                    the American establishment and Lowenstein/Moose was well-established by that

                <p>LANGE: I don't know. One of the principal topics at this meeting was the
                    performance of the Koreans. I don't remember their areas of operation in
                    Military Region 2.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, they had a district below Da Nang, around Quinhon or something was it.
                    There was a certain concern that they were under strict instructions, “Don't
                    take casualties.” However if they took any, they were quite brutal in
                    responding. I think everybody steered clear of them.</p>
                <p>LANGE: They were feared by the South Vietnamese certainly. I remember I took one
                    of my leaves and visited a friend in Korea. I talked to some Vietnamese about my
                    plans to go to Korea, and they were just dumbfounded. They were amazed, shocked
                    that I would voluntarily visit a country where everyone was Korean. They thought
                    that the Koreans were really quite brutal. A question from Moose and Lowenstein
                    was, “Are the Koreans worth $350 million a year?” I don't know where that figure
                    came from. The response amounted to “Probably not, but what's the measure of
                    value over here?” Which of course was a key question - how could you put a
                    number on it? Colonel Grist said the Koreans took high casualties to retake An
                    Khe - 116 killed and 400 wounded. He also thought their presence was
                    psychologically important. He agreed that they were “mercenaries,” but he went
                    into the difference between them and classical mercenaries. Cliff Stanley, one
                    of the briefers, was obviously dispirited, and at one point lamented, “No one
                    has accomplished a goddamned thing here.”</p>

                <p>LANGE: That's right, and command post for John Vann. He opened with this quote I
                    mentioned earlier, “You're not going to like what I'm going to say.” He said
                    Kontum could go either way; that it was still in contention. But he said the
                    North Vietnamese didn't press their advantage after Dakto and that error has
                    been hurting them a great deal. Vann said the ARVN 23rd Division, which had
                    always been a question mark in the highlands, was getting better daily. They
                    were now knocking out tanks on their own, and he thought that the North
                    Vietnamese tank resources were just about cleaned out. He thought that it was
                    quite possible that within six months there would no longer be an enemy threat
                    in the highlands, though continuation of an advisory role was necessary for air
                    support. Even if Kontum falls, he said, Pleiku was still defensible. He said
                    that the other side had underestimated the U.S. response. Vann addressed the
                    Korean role: They could not be brought up into the highlands, because of an
                    agreement. If they were to be brought up, the agreement would have to be
                    renegotiated and it would carry a healthy price tag. In any case, Vann said, we
                    labored under a general misconception that the Koreans could get along better
                    with the Vietnamese than we could.</p>

                <p>LANGE: They were veterans; they had clearly in mind who they wanted to see and
                    what they wanted to do. They had no problem with access. As for the embassy and
                    the political section, our posture was to help them as much as we could - to
                    facilitate the visits and help them see as much as they could. The military was
                    very apprehensive about their visits because generally their reports were
                    downbeat. Military reports are upbeat. At that time, the attitudes had been
                    established on both sides. Their agenda was pretty clearly in the direction of
                    deflating false optimism. They were as much insiders as I was, and my role was
                    to facilitate their inquiries where possible and to debrief people in the
                    mission on their findings.</p>

                <p>A couple of additional notes on my experiences in MRII. I visited Nha Trang one
                    time and called on Tom Barnes, who was the regional deputy for CORDS. I was
                    planning a drive from Nha Trang to Tuy Hoa, which is 70 miles up the coast. In
                    retrospect, it was a foolish thing to do on my own. I later heard that on the
                    same road a few months earlier, someone had taken a small arms round through the
                    top of the car. But Tom interposed no objection, and in fact pulled out a report
                    that he had made years previously when he was posted in Vietnam, written after a
                    drive on the same road. Some people carried their reporting around with them
                    wherever they went.</p>
                <p>I spent the night in Tuy Hoa, where a revealing episode took place. You may
                    recall the monthly HES reporthe Hamlet Evaluation Systean elaborate attempt in
                    which we invested terrific efforts to quantify the various elements of security
                    in the countryside. Very McNamarian. Some on the Tuy Hoa advisory team,
                    including FSO John Finney, had arranged to spend that night in a hamlet, as I
                    recall as sort of a demonstration that it really was safe and deserving of a
                    higher HES rating. Bad decision. Shortly after dark, we received a tense report
                    over the radio that they were taking fire, then... silence. We didn't know what
                    had happened until daylight, when the guys reported that they had spent the
                    night in a ditch, maintaining radio silence to avoid detection. So much for that
                    secure hamlet.</p>
                <p>In daylight, I visited the remains of a tower on the edge of the city left by the
                    Cham civilization. Similar remnants of the Kingdom of Champa are sprinkled along
                    the central coast of Vietnam, and then there is the excellent collection of Cham
                    sculpture in Da Nang, which was started during the French period. While I was
                    there, it was stored on the south edge of Da Nang, on the road to the airport,
                    under sort of minimum, barbed-wire security. But it survived the war, and I
                    understand is now situated in a handsome museum.</p>
                <p>Sometime in 1972, another embassy officer, Jim Nach, and I paid a visit to Tay
                    Ninh City, capital of Tay Ninh Province, on the occasion of a funeral for a
                    prominent Cao Dai elder who had been assassinated, presumably by the Viet Cong.
                    The Cao Dai religious sect was the anchor for a strong social structure, and the
                    Cao Dai was renowned for its resistance to inroads by the Viet Cong. The city is
                    about 75 miles west northwest of Saigon, and about 12 miles from the Cambodian
                    border. We drove out in Jim's Honda, the first car that Honda made. It was a
                    fairly flimsy affair and was powered by a motorcycle engine. I bought one
                    myselpaid about $800 new as I recalbut only had it for a couple of weeks before
                    it was stolen, from in front of the embassy. Anyway, the drive seemed safe
                    enough, though we did see a Vietnamese Air Force plane making a bombing run a
                    mile or so off the highway. In Tay Ninh, the funeral proceedings involved
                    thousands, and it seemed a prime target for terrorist activity. None took place,
                    however, and as far as we could judge from talking with people, the Cao Dai's
                    anti-communist resolve had not been shaken.</p>

                <p>LANGE: One of the features of life in that office was the relationship with the
                    huge U.S. military presence. There was a degree of conflict between the embassy
                    and the military structure when it came to reporting on the internal situation.
                    This had a history: It went back to existence in the embassy of a “provincial
                    reporting unit”, which challenged a lot of the rosy progress reports coming out
                    of the military. That unit had been disbanded and replaced by the internal unit,
                    which had less resources to devote to provincial reporting. There was a formal
                    clearance process for our reports with MACV (Military Assistance Command,
                    Vietnam), and Joe Bennett, who was the political counselor, had to fight those
                    battles. We thought that Bennett was excessively optimistic about prospects and
                    tended to curb “negativism” in our reports. After one of my trips to the central
                    region, I wrote a report and Bennett edited it. It came back from MACV
                    evisceratelots of strikethroughs and additions. Even Bennett was outraged. It
                    was in our view a denial of reality by MACV. It was unfortunate that even at
                    that point, there was failure to face up to reality, to live in denial.</p>

                    empowering approach, but things go haywire when it substitutes for objective

                    military training for the team, who briefed on the South Vietnamese regional
                    forces. At one point Weigand asked a very pointed question about how a
                    particular pacification goal could be attained, given the bleak objective
                    picture oconstraints and problems. The poor light colonel didn't expect that
                    sort of question from one of his own people, much less a ranking general. After

                    the mission. Declaring the mission objective as unrealistic is also not an

                    It was clear that the U.S. citizenry would not support what was necessary for a
                    military solution. The notion that Vietnam would hold together, would be able to
                    defend itself was very doubtful but nevertheless there was no choice. I don't
                    know if there was any credible intelligence at that time with respect to the
                    intentions of the North. But I think there was little illusion that if the North
                    launched a military offensive the South would hold. The American military was
                    demoralized and wanted to get out of this limited war that was draining its
                    confidence. As a nation, we wanted to get out “with honor.” Kissinger was doing
                    what he could to deliver that.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>In December, shortly before I left Vietnam, Ambassador Bunker had me in for a
                    farewell meeting. He had just finished a long dictation session with his
                    secretary, Eva Kim, and as we spoke, rockets were slamming into the airport at
                    Tan Son Nhut. Bunker was involved in the final stages of the cease-fire
                    negotiations, and he was both tired of the war and frustrated with the
                    difficulties of trying to bring it to a close. According to my contemporaneous
                    notes, he said that President Thieu was being “too rigid”. He thought that Thieu
                    had violated the negotiating principle of never establishing a public position
                    from which you cannot retreat. Bunker said that, “This war has gone on long
                    enough, and it's time it should be stopped”. The ARVN would have lost 50,000
                    soldiers by the end of this most costly year of the war, he said, with three
                    times that many wounded. There were 130,000 killed on the North Vietnamese side.
                    Bunker said that the South Vietnamese naturally have some objections to the
                    cease-fire, but he thought that they are in very much better shape than before,
                    such as when Bunker arrived six years previously. He said that the Vietnamese
                    had to surmount their internal differences, and he recalled, “That old poop,
                    Senator Hien, once concluded a discussion with the comment that 'that's the way
                    we are!' Well, that's tough, they've got to put these differences behind
                    them.”</p>
                <p>Ambassador Bunker seemed tired of dealing with Thieu. “I once told Thieu that
                    this question of corruption would one day destroy him, just as it has Chiang
                    Kai-shek.” I asked if Thieu recognized the importance of the problem. “He
                    appreciates it intellectually, but the execution is something else.” He cited
                    the case of Hoang Duc Ninh, who as Bac Lieu province chief was documented by
                    Colby for 69 clear cases of corruption. He was removed, but five months later,
                    Hoang was the commander of the 44th Special Zone, which was a mecca for
                    smuggling from Cambodia. Bunker contrasted this with the case of Truong (FNU),
                    who if he died tomorrow, the government would have to pay for his burial. His
                    troops know this, and that is why he is such a good commander, said Bunker.</p>
                <p>In those December days of 1972, we leaned on South Vietnamese deputies and
                    senators to lend their weight to signing a cease-fire. Our message was not
                    subtle: If South Vietnam fails to sign and is seen as obstructing peace, they
                    Congress would be unable to sustain a robust level of support for South Vietnam.
                    It had to be a bitter pill for the South Vietnamese to swallow, but it was clear
                    that we were determined to withdraw.</p>

                    the perfectly obscure subject of “Tax Policy and Industrial Development in the
                    Republic of China: 1928-1937,” something almost guaranteed not to have a
                    readership. Anyway, I had done work in economics, but I didn't have a proper
                    economic degree, and I didn't have systematic training in economics. So it was a
                    natural move.</p>

                <p>LANGE: I remember the course as particularly interesting because it was a period
                    of self- examination in the academic profession. Economists were extremely
                    humbled by their inability to explain what was going on in the economy at that
                    time. You may recall we had high inflation and relatively high unemployment at
                    the same time, which is not supposed to happen. Any time you see academics
                    humbled, it's rather satisfying. Warrick Elrod ran the course, but the staff
                    member we saw most often was John Sprott, who then continued as course director
                    for several years. Then he took one or more diplomatic assignments.</p>

                    a China assignment, which I was looking for. Another fellow in the course, Phil
                    Lincoln, got the job. He was a better economics student than I was, and he went
                    on to have a fine career. He went to Guangzhou as consul general in the
                    mid-1990s. Around 1996, he died in a road accident during a trip to one of the
                    provinces in China. I joined others pressing to have his name added to the
                    commemorative plaque in the State Department lobby. Phil's name was added a few
                    years later.</p>

                    in transition certainly by the '70s. Many states had already become independent,
                    and more were on their way to independence. While I was there Papua New Guinea
                    became independent. There was another fellow in the office, John Dorrance, who
                    was devoted to the Micronesia status negotiations. So I didn't really get
                    involved in that. But the Commission was a small effort at development of the
                    South Pacific nations and dependencies. The development aspect interested me,
                    and it got me out to the area a couple of times.</p>

                        beer, there doesn't seem to be anything to work with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: That's true; there is little on which to build a successful economy. To
                    grossly oversimplify, there are three models. What you saw in Micronesia and
                    what I saw in Guam, when I went to my first South Pacific Commission meeting, is
                    one model. That involves massive injection of funds from the metropolitan powers
                    - in those cases, the United States. Guam was a strange mixture. The economy was
                    supported by U.S. military spending and Japanese tourists. At that time it was a
                    favorite destination for Japanese honeymoon trips because it was fairly near to
                    Japan and it could be done on a shoestring budget. But it was a dispiriting
                    place in terms of the indigenous culture.</p>
                <p>So what happened in many other places in the South Pacifia second modewas the
                    export of native inhabitants to whatever country it was most closely associated
                    with. In the case of the Cook Islands, which was the location of the second
                    South Pacific Commission meeting I attended, it was New Zealand. There were more
                    Cook Islanders living in New Zealand than in the Cook Islands, even though to an
                    outside observer, the Cook Islands was a Polynesian paradise. It was really
                    beautiful and they had made a creditable effort at preserving Polynesian culture
                    and art. But to Polynesians, it was boring and didn't represent much in terms of
                    a future. Development was quite difficult. Even to develop fisheries seems a
                    natural, but you had competition from highly developed fishing fleets from
                    Taiwan or other countries. So the most promising people emigrated. In Tonga,
                    where I visited, which is one of the larger countries and which has been
                    independent throughout and has a very strong culture, nevertheless the common
                    aspiration was to get out and leave. Either to Australia or New Zealand or to
                    some other developed country. Many Samoans have come to the U.S., most of them
                    from American Samoa.</p>

                <p>LANGE: Yes, small-scale artisan fishing is no competition for fleets of trawlers
                    and factory ships. You don't have economies of scale for almost anything.
                    Handicrafts could only go so far. So it was quite difficult. The higher
                    standards of living in the region were in New Caledonia, where the economy was
                    based on nickel mining, and in the tiny country of Nauru, which presented the
                    very odd circumstance where they were mining the island and it was literally
                    disappearing. They exported guano, i.e., accumulated bird droppings, to the rest
                    of the world for fertilizer. So apart from those examples of extractive
                    industry, it was tough. Papua New Guinea was certainly large enough and had
                    enough resources to be viable, but it had other problems of governance because
                    it lacked infrastructure, education levels were low, and there was little in the
                    way of a national identity.</p>
                <p>A third model of development emerged somewhat later in the Northern Marianas,
                    then a part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, now in a commonwealth
                    relationship with the U.S. When I visited in the mid-1970s, there was little
                    going on economically. Now, there is a degree of prosperity, but it is based on
                    casino gambling and a garment industry based on foreign contract workers and
                    “made in the U.S.” labels. There have reportedly been social costexploitation of
                    the garment workers, many of whom are imported from low-wage countries like
                    China, and all of the ills that accompany casino culture.</p>

                    someone to attend the annual conference. The Commission, like most multinational
                    institutions, had its own internal problems. It was an education for me because
                    I also learned about Washington bureaucracy. I spent a lot more of my time
                    concerned about managing our delegation to the commission and our policy
                    positions (e.g., French nuclear testing) than about the development problems
                    that faced the South Pacific Commission.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this just a political plum that was handed out or was
                        there a rationale behind those who were appointed as U.S.
                        representatives?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>LANGE: It was a mixture. The commissioners when I first arrived, during the
                    second Nixon Administration, had Republican Party connections, presumably as
                    donors. Two were from Hawaii, and they had ties to the South Pacific. The senior
                    commissioner was a retired Air Force colonel and an arms salesman for McDonnell
                    Douglas. One of my accomplishments was to help engineer his replacement by one
                    of the senior people at the Department of the Interior who was responsible for
                    Guam - Stanley Carpenter, who was on detail from the State Department. He served
                    for a couple of years as senior commissioner for the U.S. We argued for
                    appointing someone who had a professional and policy connection to the South
                    Pacific. We also secured appointment of a commissioner who was the director of
                    the Bishop Museum in Honolulu, an academic who had done work on Polynesia. As
                    you can imagine, selling to the White House the idea of giving up a couple of
                    patronage appointments was not very easy. In the end, in retrospect, I don't
                    think these appointments made a whole lot of difference in terms of making the
                    Commission more effective.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LANGE: There wasn't a big budget for the commission to begin with, and a lot of
                    it was chewed up in a permanent secretariat operation located in New Caledonia,
                    which is about the highest cost of living place in the South Pacific. So the
                    French picked up a big part of the tab just to keep the secretariat there. But
                    it was kind of a sleepy, not terribly effective organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My experience was the fishing was taken care of by the
                        Japanese; they ate canned tuna more or less. Outside of government
                        structure, which we were supporting, there was damned little. With the best
                        will in the world, in a way we basically destroyed the island culture. But
                        with pickups and drinking beer and a few paved roads around, a lot of those
                        islands don't have the infrastructure to support a real tourism industry.
                        It's very expensive to go out there. A plane trip on Continental is very
                        expensive. It's hard to figure out what you can do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: The commission was doing some development and some basic maintenance like
                    health care. What to do about alcoholism was something that the authorities on
                    most of the islands had to worry about, and it was especially evident in what
                    was then the Trust Territories; i.e., Micronesia. I saw public intoxication, for
                    example, at midday on Truk, and I understood that it was not unusual. It is a
                    complex issue, no doubt tied to the fate of traditional culture under attack by
                    Euro-Americanization. Parallels with the plight of Native Americans are
                    impossible to avoid.</p>

                <p>LANGE: They were active, but they were also always on the defensive because they
                    were conducting their nuclear tests, which was such a highly emotional topic.
                    And even though the commission nominally didn't have very much business
                    discussing the nuclear tests, it always came up, and it always overshadowed the
                    session. There was a senior French foreign ministry guor maybe he was from their
                    colonial office, I'm not surthat had been coming to the meetings for years.
                    Everybody knew him. A lot of the islanders disliked him, because not only was
                    his job to defend what the French were doing, but he was rather glum and
                    officious, qualities that did not travel well in the Pacific islands. The French
                    put a lot of money into the commission and into their colonieFrench Polynesia
                    and New Caledonia - and they couldn't be ignored. They were the remaining
                    colonial power in the area. The British had gradually divested themselves of
                    empire in the Pacific. The Australians never really were colonials, apart from a
                    strange arrangement in the New Hebrides, which was a condominium shared by
                    Australia and France at that time. This is now the independent country of
                    Vanuatu. Our interests were centered in the northern part of the regioMicronesia
                    and Guam to the west, the colony graduated to statehood of Hawaii to the east.
                    The French, though, were the most focused and organized of the so-called
                    “metropolitan” powers.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Not much. There was another fellow on the desk who was doing political
                    military affairs. He was much more engaged in that. But of course the whole EAP
                    Bureau was in a sense mobilized by that issue.</p>

                <p>LANGE: It became a clear choice, or at least it was so framed by Bill Brown, the
                    EAP DAS with responsibility for New Zealand. He said it was a clear choice that
                    the New Zealanders had made and we had to make. Were they an ally or weren't
                    they? If they were, it meant that they had to agree to our ground rules. But the
                    political situation in New Zealand was pretty clear. The populace wasn't really
                    comfortable accommodating our nuclear-armed ships, and the political leadership
                    would accept only a clear declaration. We could not give that without
                    compromising our long-standing policy of “neither confirm nor deny.” It was an
                    issue I was to revisit nearly 20 years later when I was in Malta.</p>

                <p>LANGE: Trade in dairy products was an issue with New Zealand especially. Trade in
                    meat products was a problem with both Australia and New Zealand. The sugar quota
                    was a big deal with Fiji. That was an annual exercise to settle on the import
                    quota and how much various countries got, in order to prop up the price of
                    sugar. That occupied a lot of time and effort and representation and briefing
                    papers and so forth as the Fijians made their case for more sugar and as the New
                    Zealanders made their case for doing away with quotas on dairy products. These
                    issues are still with us.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LANGE: The New Zealanders made the reasonable case that theirs was the only
                    country in the world that did not subsidize dairy products. They weren't very
                    happy that we on the one hand professed belief in fair trade and on the other
                    protected our dairy interests with import quotas. We did our best to square the
                    circle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, with the sugar business, you're up against a very
                        strong political lobby, particularly in Louisiana and California. How did
                        you deal with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Florida, too. As you might imagine, Fiji didn't swing a lot of political
                    weight. But there was a certain sympathy factor operating for the Fijians. That
                    was fortunate, because they were not aggressive, had little leverage, and had no
                    high-priced lobbyists. The best you could do was to try and provide for a
                    certain growth rate of imports from Fiji, depending on the nature of our market
                    and our domestic crop. So that's what we had to work within, a very narrow
                    range. The Fijians received a tiny portion, as I recall less than five percent,
                    of the total import quota. They didn't expect a lot, and it was damned important
                    to Fiji.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the U.S. as a market for sugar. Can't you sell
                        sugar somewhere else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Sure. I daresay we weren't the biggest market for Fiji. I don't remember
                    the details of their market picture. They once had a lot of competition from
                    Australia because the Australians grew sugar in Queensland, though not any more.
                    Europe was a principal market for Fijian sugar, and they would have some sort of
                    Commonwealth preferences with the UK.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>Sugar trade brought profound changes to Fiji. In the late 19th and early 20th
                    centuries, the British brought in about 60,000 laborers from India to work the
                    sugar plantations. The Indians are more prolific than the native Fijians, and
                    today native Fijians are a minority, but certain rights, including property
                    rights, are limited for Indians. On one occasion, Supreme Court Justice William
                    Douglas invited the desk officer for Fiji, that would be me, to lunch. I quizzed
                    his secretary to learn what he wanted to discuss, but unsuccessfully. Try as I
                    might, I couldn't learn what prompted this invitation from the blue. As it
                    turned out, Douglas had visited Fiji some years previously, and he was
                    interested to know how their efforts to deal with this Fijian/Indian balance in
                    their constitution had evolved. It was one of those slap-the-forehead moments:
                    Of course, isn't that just the thing a justice would be interested in! I
                    sincerely wished that I could have enlightened him, but Fiji constitutional
                    history was one subject that I had not studied up on. Douglas didn't seem
                    especially disappointed and we discussed other developments in Fiji. I was
                    pleased to lunch at the exclusive Cosmopolitan Club for the first and only time,
                    but I'm afraid that I didn't earn my meal.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Trade in both dairy and meat products were issues. They did not export
                    sugar. We, at the time I was on the desk, expended a lot of effort trying to
                    expand our export markets in Australia because they were growing economically.
                    We had a fair amount of direct investments in Australia. At the time I came on
                    the desk, Marshall Green was the ambassador. I don't know if he was the first
                    career ambassador we ever had there, but he was certainly the first we'd had in
                    many years. Green had a sense of humor, and he often quipped that previous
                    American ambassadors had tended to think of Australia as the next large cattle
                    ranch west of Texas. We had a tradition of sending ambassadors there who had
                    earned a political reward. So he was a different kind of animal, and I think by
                    and large Australians appreciated that.</p>

                <p>One of my more interesting experiences on the desk was accompanying Ronald
                    Reagan, who was then governor of California, to that part of the world in
                    December 1973. The genesis of the trip was a standing invitation from the Red
                    Cross of the Australian State of Victoria, to help them kick off their annual
                    fundraising drive. He accepted the invitation and then let the White House know
                    that he was traveling in that regiowas there anything that he could do for the
                    White House? And sure enough there was. He was designated as a “special
                    representative of the president to promote exports.” The trip went to Melbourne,
                    which is the capital of Victoria, and to Sydney and then to Singapore and
                    finally to Jakarta.</p>
                <p>As is typically the case, the department was throwing together briefing material
                    at the last minute and decided that it would look better to send an escort. I
                    was available. There were two of us actually; one fellow from protocol went
                    along also. We picked up the plane at Andrews and it went out to Los Angeles to
                    pick up the Reagan party and continue on the trip. About 15 minutes from landing
                    in Los Angeles, the protocol officer made the discovery that the briefing books
                    had, on the nice blue covers with gold seal and lettering, misspelled Reagan as
                    “Regan.” So we crashed for the next 10 minutes taking apart the books and hiding
                    the covers. As soon as we got on the ground we grabbed a taxi to a drugstore,
                    near Los Angeles International, and bought out its binders. I think we had two
                    or three different colors. We snuck them back on the plane and put the briefing
                    books all back together so at least we didn't start the trip with a strike
                    against the State Department. I don't know who read the briefing books; the
                    Reagan's certainly didn't. At a certain point before we arrived in Australia,
                    there was a casual meeting on the plane, what amounted to a briefing of the
                    party. It included Mike Deaver and a guy named Livingston who has since dropped
                    out of sight but was Deaver's equal at the time.</p>

                <p>Governor Reagan went over the outline of the keynote speech he had planned for
                    the big dinner in Melbourne. It was a speech he had given several times before
                    and, he said, was well received. The message was one of his trademark themeto
                    get government out of people's lives. He asked how that would be received in
                    Australia. I told him that there was a labor government at the national level in
                    Canberra that wouldn't be particularly receptive to that message, but for the
                    nationalist government in Victoria, it would be music to their ears. He asked
                    rhetorically, “We don't care anything about Labor's reaction, do we?” I wisely
                    agreed. I was subsequently less wise, however. The first night out, when the
                    Reagan's and the senior party went to the dinner and fancy dress ball, the rest
                    of us went out to dinner and engaged in a discussion of Watergate, which was at
                    that time in full flow. December '73. It turned out, in retrospect not
                    surprisingly, that I and the cultural officer from the Melbourne consulate ended
                    up arguing one side of the case and everybody else was arguing the other - the
                    other being that Watergate was completely politically inspired; i.e., a plot by
                    the Democrats. It was a very spirited discussion, which at times probably
                    crossed the line into heated argument. One of my favorite lines, uttered by the
                    other side, through clenched teeth: “The Sam Ervins of this country have a lot
                    to answer for.” I subsequently related the experience to the protocol officer,
                    Patrick, who had not been at the dinner. Patrick was aghast that I could show
                    such poor judgment as to get involved in this discussion with people who served
                    a person who conceivably could be president. President! To my discredit, I
                    laughed and said, “You can't be serious.” Of course he was right, and I was
                    wrong. Patrick had been around the block a few times. I still view the
                    discussion as one that should be possible in any free society. Patrick saw it as
                    a question of discretion, of how the department presents itself to people from
                    the outside. Both points of view can be argued.</p>
                <p>I did learn something from the episode that was of immediate use. It became known
                    that I was the only person reading the newspapers on the trip. On the long
                    flight to Singapore, I was invited into the Reagans' presence to brief them on
                    what had been happening back in Washington. That was at the time the House was
                    debating the question of what constituted an impeachable offense. At one point,
                    Nancy, who of course had a reputation for being not only Reagan's protector but
                    his enforcer, fixed me with a hard look and asked me what I thought the
                    congressmen were doing when they even considered whether Watergate-related
                    events were relevant to impeachment. I was suitably cautious, and had the sense
                    to plead ignorance, that I didn't know what they thought were doing.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>The Singapore stop was without any sort of significant incident, though this was
                    an important shopping interlude for most of the party. The baggage hold was
                    pretty full from then on. In Jakarta, another event offers some insight into the
                    relationship between the department and trips of this sort. Deaver said one of
                    the things they wanted to do was to get the Indonesians interested in some of
                    the things that California had to offer in agriculture, such as growing rice,
                    and he was annoyed that the control officer had not picked up and amplified the
                    idea. Well, it's not immediately apparent what California has to offer Indonesia
                    in terms of growing rice. There may be something, who knows? Never mind that we
                    already had an aid mission in Indonesia for some years. Deaver said, rightly I
                    suppose, “There may be things we can teach the Indonesians about growing rice.”
                    But Deaver interpreted the control officer's reaction as not suitably
                    enthusiastic. He went on to say, “After all, we developed the square tomato.” I
                    was speechless, but at least I wasn't negative. After all, while square tomatoes
                    aren't especially tasty, they travel well and they're great for growers,
                    shippers and supermarkets.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LANGE: It packs. I'm sure you can bounce one on this table. Anyway the whole trip
                    was a learning experience for me. I did not have the impression that it was for
                    the Reagan entourage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Ronald Reagan on this
                        trip?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Well it was not unlike the impression a lot of other people had of Ronald
                    Reagan. “Amiable dunce” may be a harsh judgment, but he didn't seem to be Mr.
                    Deep Thinker, either. He had messages, anti big government, for example, and he
                    delivered those very well. His timing was great. He was charming; he was
                    disarming. But he needed people to help him get ready. He was not prepared, for
                    example, to answer questions from journalists in Australia: “How can you justify
                    this trip at a time when we're having an energy crisis? How much is this trip
                    costing? What will be the benefits?” He and his party resented that sort of
                    question, which they seemed to regard as lese majesty. “He's the representative
                    of the President; how can they question the worth of this trip?” Between
                    Melbourne and Sydney, and again between Sydney and Singapore, we worked on
                    suitable answers for those questions. He was prepared, on the other hand, for
                    another question: “How does acting prepare you to be president?” His answer was
                    not very convincing, but he did come to show us, didn't he, that for better or
                    worse, acting and political success have much in common. Anyway, all things
                    considered, I thought on this trip he came across as a very likeable person but
                    with a very limited range. I would not have imagined that this qualified him to
                    be elected president, but I later came to understand better the value of
                    packaging in political life.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>Reagan's career was based on trashing government; the most recent government
                    mega-building in Washington is the Reagan Building. He fired the air
                    controllers; National Airport is now named after him. If irony could be tasted,
                    this would be delicious.</p>

                        watch out for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: To be sure! I was admitted to the inner circle only a few times, but she
                    was always serious and focused, much more focused and much more interested in
                    the political questions than he was. I was very conscious that I was being
                    tested when she braced me with the question about congress and an impeachable
                    offense. As a group, the whole party thought that Watergate was wholly
                    political, that there was nothing impeachable about Watergate. When we landed in
                    California, Ed Meese, who I think was his chief of staff, got on board before we
                    deplaned and told Reagan exactly what the issues were and what he should say
                    about them. There was very little back and forth; it was very one-sided. It was
                    almost like winding him up. I hate to put it that way, but that was my
                    impression. Really, I came away thinking this is not a person who should be
                    elected as president.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Meese came out with what the issues were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: He boarded the plane before Reagan got off, and he gave him a very full
                    briefing on what had happened in California and what he should be saying about
                    it. And this is the way Reagan got information; it was face-to-face,
                    person-to-person. I doubt that anyone ever read those briefing books that we
                    prepared for the trip.</p>

                <p>Philippines, 1975-79: The Later Marcos Era</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left this job in '75; where did you go then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: In 1975, I got the job in Manila. I extended the usual three-year tour for
                    one year, so I was there 1975-79. It was a great tour. A friend and I built a
                    sailboat, which we raced and took to islands not far from Luzon - Mindoro,
                    Marinduque, Romblon. I was in the combined commercial and economic section; it
                    was 1979 or so that Commerce established its own foreign commercial service. But
                    my position was more economic than commercial; I was the financial economist, so
                    I did the macroeconomic reporting. I dealt with the international financial
                    institutions and their projects. I was the embassy's liaison with the Agency for
                    International Development (AID) mission, which was quite large in the
                    Philippines at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got there in '75, what was the situation as you
                        saw it - political, economic - in the Philippines at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: This was well into the martial law period under Ferdinand Marcos. It was
                    clear that the nature of the Marcos regime was crony capitalism. It was not
                    clear the extent to which Marcos and the Marcos family were engaged in
                    corruption and how much they had accumulated. That became clear later. In terms
                    of attitudes of Filipinos, it was my feeling - and some in the embassy would not
                    agree with this - my feeling was that most people still had a positive attitude
                    toward Marcos and martial law because they remembered earlier years when there
                    was a lot of unrest and lawlessness, and a sort of warlord rule in the
                    countryside and the provinces. I think many Filipinos welcomed collection of
                    weapons and general lowering of temperature of life in the streets, and that
                    Marcos still enjoyed a pretty high degree of popular support, although he was
                    disliked by the political opposition and much of the intelligentsia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're economic-commercial, so how was it for Americans
                        doing business in the Philippines in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: It was pretty positive. There was an active and influential American
                    chamber of commerce, which was of long standing in the Philippines. American
                    businessmen liked martial law, but were somewhat ambivalent toward Marcos. They
                    liked stability, but corruption was beginning to be a problem. One of my
                    responsibilities was to try to help American companies get in on the ground
                    floor on major projects. And there were a lot of projects, in both basic
                    infrastructure nature and as part of the buildup for the International Monetary
                    Fund and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IMF/IBRD)
                    meetings that took place in Manila in October 1976. There was a huge landfill
                    project In Manila Bay, a major conference center that was being built on the
                    landfill and several hotel projects, all of which had murky financial
                    arrangements. Our knowledge of the Marcos regime's connections to these projects
                    gradually accumulated, but when I was there, it was only suspected. There was
                    one major project, a nuclear power project, that an American company was
                    successful in landing, which eventually proved to be very controversial.
                    Actually, it was controversial from the beginning, because the Philippines lies
                    in a major earthquake zone, so there were some basic questions about the wisdom
                    of a nuclear power reactor on Luzon. It was nevertheless heavily competed, and
                    in that sort of atmosphere you knew political connections had to play a role.
                    Company people came close to acknowledging that while I was there.</p>

                <p>LANGE: Westinghouse. They came close to acknowledging that they had a “special
                    relationship” with Malacanang, the presidential palace. This later became the
                    subject of official enquiry.</p>
                <p>Q: I can't remember when, but in '77 of course, the Carter administration came in
                    and they had a rather firm policy about anti-corruption and paying bribes and
                    all that. During the time you were there, had Congress passed the anti-bribery
                    law, which basically said an American firm could not pay money under the table
                    to get contracts?</p>
                <p>LANGE: I don't know when that was passed, but it was certainly part of the
                    background of doing business there. American business hated the law, believed it
                    put us at a competitive disadvantage. I saw the impact of the Carter
                    administration more in the human rights area. This affected our posture toward
                    projects supported by international financial institutions (IFIs) a new emphasis
                    on human rights and a general atmosphere of, how shall I put it, greater human
                    rights context to our policy in the Philippines. It became a more explicit U.S.
                    policy with the Carter administration. That was the time when the position of
                    Assistant Secretary for Human Rights was established. Pat Derian, the A/S for
                    Human Rights, had some extremely contentious visits to the Philippines.</p>
                <p>When I arrived in Manila, William Sullivan was the ambassador. He had a decidedly
                    arms length relationship with the Marcos family and particularly with Imelda.
                    There was a real antagonism there. After Sullivan departed (for Iran), there was
                    an interregnum, and the charge, Lee Stull, allowed the embassy to enter the warm
                    embrace of Imelda. She had a government position, which was as minister for
                    something with the wonderful acronym BLISS. This was derived from Bagong Lipunan
                    Sites and Services, which dealt with local development, that sort of thing. The
                    AID mission had always avoided this ministry like the plague. They didn't want
                    to get involved with BLISS, and particularly with Imelda. But then Stull, who
                    had come up through the USIS, thought we should engage. Imelda was all too happy
                    to engage, and in a big way. She started sending her van around to pick up
                    embassy officers to go visit her projects, which were typically long on
                    sentiment and drama and short on coherence. It was a difficult time for the AID
                    mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that point, it was pretty well determined that Imelda
                        was not somebody you wanted to get close to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Well, the AID position was that her notion of development was far removed
                    from the mandated basic human needs approach that they operated under. She
                    talked the talk, but she didn't walk the walk. She had very high profile
                    projects. She had a heart center that she supported and other medical programs
                    that had nothing to do with AID priorities. They just felt that to get involved
                    would distort their program and absorb their energies.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>Anyway, the Stull interregnum was good for me in a selfish sense because I got to
                    get out to see a lot of the Philippines. I was already traveling a fair amount
                    because I was visiting World Bank and Asian Development Bank projects. But Stull
                    traveled a great deal to the south, including to Muslim areas down there. I
                    doubt that anyone from the embassy travels to those areas these dayZamboanga,
                    Lake Lanao in northern Mindanao, even Basilan and the Jolo Islands.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LANGE: I don't think so. There was a substantial military attach� presence there,
                    and they had their own plane, which the ambassador could request. I don't think
                    that Sullivan took advantage of it, but Stull certainly did.</p>
                <p>A brief aside on travel by small plane in the Philippines. Early in 1976, not
                    long after I arrived, the economic counselor, Ed Cheney, who was my boss, along
                    with Garnett Zimmerly, the head of the AID mission, and Henry Lee, a Treasury
                    officer who was on the U.S. delegation to the Asian Development Bank, visited a
                    project somewhere outside of Manila. They were returning in poor weather
                    conditionwind, low ceiling and raiwhen their plane disappeared. The search went
                    on for several days, engaging all resources of the Philippine and U.S.
                    militaries. The emergency transmitter eventually faded out, and the search was
                    abandoned. Later that year, the crash site was located, and it was in a heavily
                    wooded area not far from Manila. It was a real loss to the mission. The country
                    is well known for its rugged and remote arearecall the WWII Japanese soldier who
                    only came out of hiding in 1975, and the “Lost Tribe of the Tasaday” on

                    In the Philippines, it was so much more obvious than it was in Vietnam. You had
                    individuals and families that were incredibly wealthy in the Philippines, and
                    they didn't mind showing it. At that the same time, you had this terrible
                    poverty at the bottom. You probably saw last week the tragedy at the Manila city
                    dump.</p>

                <p>LANGE: This very area in Manila, Tondo, was the location of a groundbreaking
                    World Bank project. They tried to attack this problem of the squatters coming in
                    and settling near the dumps. Of course the development dilemma is serious: Do
                    you want to improve living conditions for people there, thus possibly attracting
                    more people to come in from the countryside? This was a serious project that got
                    a lot of attention. Cong. Steve Solarz came out and visited it. I visited the
                    area several times, and the conditions that people lived in were really poor,
                    even in the project area, which had drainage, streets, and sanctioned access to
                    electricity (as opposed to just tapping into the nearest power line). The
                    difference, the huge gap between the poorest and the richest was so obvious. One
                    of the development puzzles about the Philippines was that it has always shown
                    great promise, with a reasonable good infrastructure and good human resources,
                    and yet it was not one of the Asian economic tigers. There are some objective
                    barriers to development. Communications and transportation was a problem. The
                    topography is rugged and forbidding, and with the exception of some lowland
                    paddy, the ground is not very fertile. On the island of Cebu, the crops were so
                    poor that I hardly recognized corn plants as such. Atomization of the country
                    into thousands of islands makes it difficult to move products around or deliver
                    services. On a trip to the remote island of Palawan, we visited a hospital where
                    malaria patients were so numerous they were crowding the hallways. There was no
                    medication to treat them.</p>

                    thought to be an advantage in the international marketplace, and I'm sure it
                    was. But the country always seemed to be a substandard performer in the Asian
                    context. I think recently things have looked better; they have done better in
                    the macro sense. But the export picture at that time was very much dominated by
                    a few commodities - sugar, coconut, to some extent mineral products, nickel and
                    copper - so they were subject to the vagaries of international markets.</p>

                <p>LANGE: We didn't explicitly promote investments in those types of things.
                    American labor unions were watching to be sure we didn't encourage
                    investmentthrough the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, for examplin
                    labor-intensive industry. Our role was more to give an objective assessment of
                    the political and economic picture. One of the other issues that I spent a great
                    deal of time on was external debt and balance of payments. That was a chronic
                    problem and one of the questions that visitors always had. For commercial banks,
                    it was a double-edged sword. They made a lot of money off of third world debt,
                    including Philippine debt, and the higher the risk, the higher the profit. So
                    they didn't necessarily view the high debt situation as a bad thing, as long as
                    collapse, i.e., default, could be put off to the indefinite future. This and
                    related issuethe value of the peso, the balance of payments and the debt service
                    burdecame under the economic analysis part of my job. The other part was
                    analysis of political stability. It is much easier to see in retrospect that
                    Marcos was not going to step down gracefully, and that eventually there would
                    have to be some sort of wrenching adjustment.</p>
                <p>A couple of anecdotes about the political scene: A political officer, Ralph
                    Braibanti, and I took a trip to northern Luzon, including the area where Marcos
                    came from. One of my reasons for taking the trip was to visit a World Bank dam
                    project up in the highlandthe Chico River, or perhaps it was the Magat River
                    dawhich was going to displace a number of tribal people in the area. Overall, it
                    was probably a good project, but the immediate impact in terms of relations with
                    the minorities in that area was not good. On our way back to Manila, we were
                    overnight guests of the governor of Ilocos Sur, which is maybe 100 miles north
                    of Manila. He was a character out of some novel who had - how shall I say -
                    floated to the top after the declaration of martial law. Our stay led me to the
                    conclusion that before martial law, everybody in that province was armed and
                    dangerous. After martial law, only the governor and his cronies were armed and
                    dangerous. His recreational interesin fact apparently the sum total of his
                    interestwas cockfighting. He didn't appear to think much about governing but
                    rather about maintaining his hold on power. He was surrounded by bodyguards. The
                    morning of our departure, we noticed our embassy driver was red-eyed, and we
                    were afraid he was going to fall asleep at the wheel. He told us that some of
                    the governor's bodyguards got him in a card game in which there was a lot of
                    drinking. He said that he was afraid to stop playing. Maybe this was just his
                    story, but we knew him well, and he wasn't a drinker. He was genuinely fearful
                    of these goons. The governor had on his wall an enlarged news photo, which had
                    him alighting from a jeep with an M-16 to confront a man in the road, also with
                    an M-16 at the ready. They were each evidently prepared to use them. He had
                    captioned the scene, “Outlaw Country.” He was caught up in this Wild West
                    mythology: He was Marcos's man in Ilocos Sur. Probably most people were glad
                    that the streets, for those who didn't cross the governor, were safer than they
                    had been. But there wasn't much of a nod toward democratic governance.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>The Marcos regime was not really comfortable with genuine democracy. For example,
                    my sailing partner was a journalist who was pretty tight with the opposition and
                    got into trouble with the regime several times for his reporting. He was the
                    subject of a deportation hearing that went on for several months, tied simply
                    because to his reporting on the opposition. For Marcos, the handwriting was
                    beginning to appear on the wall. The question was if Marcos would voluntarily
                    loosen his grip on power.</p>

                        generals got in trouble [because] he got very close to the family and all.

                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Well, I mentioned Sullivan's posture, which was to remain at a distance.
                    The last ambassador while I was there was Dick Murphy, who amusingly thought he
                    had been assigned by mistake. He was an Arab-speaking Middle East specialist,
                    and he honestly thought that someone had confused his name with another Murphy.
                    Sullivan had gone on to Iran, and events there had led everyone to rethink how
                    we relate to countries controlled by strongmen. There was a lot of internal
                    examination, how we were relating to the regime, how we were reporting it, if we
                    were missing indicators of the sort that would have let us predict the sort of
                    things that had happened in Iran. I think there was much more consciousness when
                    I left in '79 than when I arrived in '75 about looking for indicators outside
                    the power structure. But apart from this problem that I mentioned earlier, that
                    the AID mission specifically had of being associated with Imelda, I don't think
                    there was a problem, that I know of anyway, relating to the Marcos group.</p>
                <p>I became friendly with a young Malacanang staffer. His family was well off, he
                    had gone to school in the U.S., Cornell, and he was pretty full of himself. We
                    got together socially, but it never became a problem in terms of him trying to
                    use the relationship. He was, unfortunately, discreet when it came to goings-on
                    at Malacanang.</p>

                <p>LANGE: We had a very well developed visa referrals system. It was thoroughly
                    institutionalized, with forms to fill out, as I assume is common with all
                    high-pressure visa operations, such as in the Philippines. Long lines of
                    applicants appeared every morning. We had a system of rotation onto the visa
                    line for junior officers. I escaped that, having spent my junior years in
                    Vietnam. I never issued a visa, in Manila or anywhere else. I'm not sorry I
                    missed the work, and I'm not too sorry I missed the experience. Anyway, junior
                    officers would go into the visa section on rotation and they were aghast at the
                    way we treated visa applicants, funneling them through like cattle. We'd give
                    them a 60-second interview. But I mean pressure was there, you couldn't escape
                    it. After two months in that atmosphere, doing that job, everybody seemed to
                    arrive at the same place. You couldn't be compassionate. You didn't have the
                    time. You'd been lied to enough times that you were deeply suspicious of any

                <p>LANGE: Every place I've been, people imagine that the ambassador could mandate
                    issuance of a visa. As far as I could see, that wasn't true. Consuls general
                    maintained their independence, while sensitive to an ambassador's views, to be
                    sure. For us grunts, when we got a special appeal from a contact, we filled out
                    the referral form and sent it in, and sometimes a reinterview had an effect and
                    sometimes it didn't. It was the same in Poland and in China, both high-volume
                    visa posts.</p>

                        the law, in a way, that an ambassador cannot issue a visa and cannot order a
                        visa to be issued. Sometimes by indirection; it's not a good idea to cross
                        the ambassador too often. But also any ambassador knows that they can't
                        order a visa to be issued. So it's a good out for them; it gives then an
                        escape clause.</hi>

                    Philippines, what year that was. 1986, I believe. Even by the time I left the
                    Philippines, in '79, there was a lot of sentiment that we had gone too far in
                    supporting a less-than-democratic leader. I remember there was a Time magazine
                    cover article, just before I left. I think the background image was an inferno
                    or explosion and the thrust of the article, which was by Ross Munro - whom I
                    talked to when he came through the Philippines - the thrust of his article was
                    that the Philippines was a powder keg and Marcos' days were definitely numbered.
                    So there was a lot of reflection on the appropriate policy. I mentioned earlier
                    that after the Shah was overthrown in Iran, there was a lot of government-wide
                    examination about this issue — the balance between supporting democracy and
                    supporting a leader who could control and with whom you were friendly. Murphy,
                    in Manila, held regular Friday sessions with junior and mid-level embassy
                    officers exploring this question from different angles. How could we measure the
                    support Marcos had, and what should we be doing to prepare for the post-Marcos
                    period? This was a very live subject in '79, and the dilemma continued up until
                    Marcos's departure.</p>

                    itself was at Yang Ming Shan in the mountains north of Taipei, which had become
                    a rather well to do suburb of the city. It was a real excursion to go downtown,
                    so we were really separate from day-to-day AIT operations, both as a matter of
                    policy and in a geographic sense. Still, while we were exposed to Chinese
                    language and culture outside the classroom, it was not exactly immersion; we led
                    a rather suburban existence, and passed much of our free time together, speaking
                    English among ourselves.</p>

                        at the school, from your contacts, a sense of growing Taiwanese nationalism
                        itself, concern about China? Things were changing.</hi>

                <p>LANGE: That's right. I noticed outside the room here a book by Chuck Cross, the
                    first AIT director in Taipei. I'm sure he covered the transition very well.
                    Taiwan was still under martial law, as it had been since the late '40s. Politics
                    were still very much dominated by the KMT, the Kuomintang. 1980 was the time of
                    the Kaohsiung Incident, when a demonstration by the Democratic Progressive Party
                    - the DPP - in Kaohsiung turned violent. A number of DPP figures were arrested
                    and tossed in jail. At that time - '79-'8the people on Taiwan were reeling under
                    our derecognition and still very fearful of what that meant. Very watchful of
                    the effect of the Taiwan Relations Act and to what extent they could still rely
                    on the U.S. umbrella to help them avoid reunification with the mainland. There
                    was a lot of uncertainty, and a certain fatalism as well because virtually
                    everyone else in the world, with the exception of two or three dozen smaller
                    countries, had recognized Beijing. That's what makes present day Taiwan so
                    remarkable, because that's only 20 years ago. Within 10 years after the
                    Kaohsiung Incident, the DPP was legal, martial law had been lifted, and Taiwan
                    was on its way to real democracy.</p>

                        how did it work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Well, there was quite a lot available in academic journals, and more was
                    appearing all the time. There was more scope for Chinese economists to explore
                    the nature of their economy. There was a growing acceptability of alternate
                    models. As of '78, Deng Xiaoping had embraced opening to the outside world. So
                    this was a major new factor in Chinese economic orthodoxy. Getting a handle on
                    the Chinese economy was of course something else. Statistics were (and still
                    are) extremely suspect, regardless of the new attitudes and acceptability of new
                    ideas. There was still pressure from the leadership to report positively. So all
                    the statistics were quite doubtful. We spent a fair amount of time trying to
                    identify, through looking at the press and journal articles, individuals that we
                    could talk to, who could give us some insight into policymaking, trends,
                    attitudes, and particularly those that had some importance to American
                    businessmen and others. There were just three of us in the unit. One of the
                    others was on loan from the Agency and his Chinese was excellent because he had
                    grown up in Taiwan. He's since joined AID with his wife.</p>

                <p>LANGE: No, it was really an embassy position; it was not an Agency position. The
                    arrangement provided a cross-fertilization benefit to the Agency and the embassy
                    gained a Chinese language resource. The position was short term, but it was
                    reestablished from time to time.</p>

                        [they'd be] so sensitive about giving out economic information, like how
                        many shoes they sold would be a state secret or something. And this would be
                        an inhibitor on the part of people who'd be willing to talk to you.</hi>

                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>LANGE: Quite right. To have a spontaneous conversation with anybody in China was
                    extremely difficult for a foreigner, and as a representative of the embassy, we
                    were even more on the outside. The Chinese have a foreign affairs bureau for any
                    sizeable institution. The job of these “barbarian handlers” was to deal with
                    foreigners, either businessmen or foreign officials. You had to go through them
                    to set up meetings or visits. To be fair, some of these offices really did do
                    their best to facilitate access to people and information. But they often were
                    barriers and saw their jobs as minimizing contact between the foreigner and real
                    people in the organization. Their function was also to present a picture that
                    was approved by the local party structure. There was an additional constraint.
                    At the time I was there, there was a system of notification of the foreign
                    ministry whenever one traveled outside of a certain perimeter around Beijing.
                    Usually we could go where we wanted, but it meant that everyone along the way
                    knew you were coming. The economists and officials were usually quite careful,
                    limiting themselves to saying what they'd already said in print. So it magnified
                    the problem of trying to understand what was going on.</p>
                <p>Q: In a way, particularly in economics, which is so important - and I'm thinking
                    of countries such as China - it sounds like you were, with all this fancy
                    “restoring relations” and all the hubbub and all, you were almost back, as far
                    as you were concerned, to the bad old days of sitting around in Hong Kong and
                    trying to figure out what the hell was happening by reading newspapers and
                    reading journals and picking up information that way.</p>
                <p>LANGE: Yes and no. Of course, you could read all the journals in Hong Kong and
                    the newspaper articles. But I think the added element was personal experience,
                    the ability to observe things that were going on. You visit a factory, and they
                    couldn't totally pull the wool over your eyes because you could see what was
                    going on. Was stuff coming out the other end of the assembly line or not? Was
                    machinery sitting idle or not? And notwithstanding limitations on contacts and
                    pervasive self-censorship, we could talk to people. During the period I was
                    there, there was a certain amount of rivalry between our missions in Hong Kong
                    and Beijing, but the balance of value-added reporting had clearly shifted toward
                    Beijing. The other consulates we had established already - Shanghai and
                    Guangzhou, had also become significant bases for reporting, even with their
                    constraints.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think the strength, the muscle that made
                        everything work in Hong Kong was its staff of Chinese foreign service
                        nationals who'd been doing this for years who were not particularly, they,
                        just by the fact that they were in Hong Kong, they were not tools of the
                        Chinese mainland government. I know that during this, they were really
                        finely honed, as far as picking up things. Whereas in Beijing, my
                        understanding is that the ministry that handles barbarians was assigning you
                        people. You couldn't go out in the street and hire people. So, in a way, you
                        were deprived of objective, local nationals to read the journals.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>LANGE: That was certainly a weakness of the operation in Beijing. The local
                    employees were assigned by the Diplomatic Services Bureau, an office under the
                    foreign ministry. The embassy could refuse people on interview, for one reason
                    or another, but you couldn't, as you say, go out and recruit people for a
                    position. It was John Thompson, who was running the information section, who
                    first managed to get around that. He identified somebody who made himself
                    available through the Diplomatic Services Bureau. I don't know the details, but
                    he got a very good person as a senior FSN. But usually the people you would get
                    were career diplomats or government people who had an English language
                    capability, who accurately saw this assignment as not contributing to their
                    career. We suspected that some might have been made available by their parent
                    organization to the DSB because they weren't performing. So we got a really
                    mixed bag of Chinese employees, and we relied on them much less than did the
                    operation in Hong Kong. Remember, however, that things were changing fairly
                    fast, and the job of reporting from China posts shifted away from reading tea
                    leaves toward keeping on top of developments. We did have our employees in
                    Beijing scan the press and alert us to interesting developments and do the
                    contact work - setting up appointments and so forth. But we certainly didn't
                    have a cadre of really topnotch local employees to provide analysis.</p>

                        various people? Were they responsive, or did you feel they were told to let
                        you come but don't show too much or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: It varied a lot. Once you penetrated this layer of barbarian handlers and
                    got to people beyond that barrier, often they were enthusiastic. They were
                    thrilled in some cases that somebody was interested in what they were doing, or
                    more importantly, that it might lead to foreign investment and change their
                    lives. In some cases, not; they didn't see any advantage to cooperating or
                    revealing any more than was required. They didn't see any relevance; they were
                    just going through the motions.</p>
                <p>Apart from more or less formally-arranged visits, it was possible to deduce quite
                    a lot just from direct observation. To illustrate, I might relate some
                    experiences from a visit to Sichuan Province.</p>

                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>LANGE: This was the winter of 1980-81. I took the train, which was the principal
                    means of travel within the country, and it probably took between a day and 30
                    hours. In that time, I passed from the harsh winter landscape of northern China,
                    through the even more forbidding mud-brown villages of Henan, then into the
                    mountains separating North China from the protected basin of Sichuan. At about
                    this point in the journey, it was time for dinner. Foreigners could not go to
                    the dining car while Chinese were there, so I was summoned to dine after all
                    others had eaten. I was the only foreigner on the train. It was darn cold in the
                    car, so cold in fact that the grease that is a normal component of Chinese
                    cuisine had congealed on top of the dishes. I picked at it, but couldn't get
                    anything down. About a half hour after I returned to my compartment (which
                    again, I alone occupied), a terrified-looking cook called on me to ask if there
                    were anything wrong with dinner. He seemed petrified that I was going to
                    complain when we arrived. I assured him, and the conductor who was there as a
                    witness, that I suffered from a tender stomach and simply was unable to keep
                    anything down. He was clearly relieved that I was sick.</p>
                <p>Deng Xiaoping had only established the “opening to the outside” economic policy
                    in '78, and there was a terrific lag in carrying it out, especially in the
                    hinterlands. It was really only getting underway at that time. Sichuan is an
                    interior province, far from the coast. It is the province to which the
                    Nationalist leader, Chiang Kai-shek, retreated in the face of the Japanese
                    invasion in the late 1930s and established the Nationalist headquarters. It is
                    an incredibly populous province, with over 100 million people even at that time.
                    So it's very important. Because of its isolation, ideas and trends often got to
                    Sichuan much later than to the coastal areas. But it was very lively at that
                    time; the markets were packed. There was a lot of very small-scale market
                    activity - people selling things off the back of their bicycles and so forth.
                    One seller of baskets was an old man who came in from the countryside. They were
                    very attractive, and I still have a couple of them. So I began to engage him in
                    bargaining. Eventually we struck a price, and by this time we had drawn a crowd
                    of maybe 150 people who were watching this process because many of them had
                    never seen a foreigner. So after he had exchanged his baskets for my money, he
                    started talking to the crowd, defending his price as a fair price. He insisted
                    that it was the same he would have charged anybody else; he hadn't exploited the
                    foreigner, there was a lot of work involved in making the basket, etc. This
                    resulted in a lively and serious discussion among all these people about whether
                    this was a fair price or not. Eventually the consensus seemed to be that yes,
                    this was a fair price. It was strange that he felt obligated to defend his
                    price, possibly because he had always operated with fixed prices, selling to his
                    cooperative or whatever. And passersby didn't think it odd to pass judgment on
                    whether his price was fair or not. You won't find that sort of innocence in any
                    corner of China today.</p>
                <p>Generally, prices were low in Sichuan. Seven of us went out for a big
                    dinneadmittedly unrefined food (Sichuan cuisine is considered to be peasant fare
                    among sophisticated Chinese) and it cost the equivalent of a dollar apiece.
                    Radio and TV retail outlets were doing a very brisk business. Bicycles and
                    sewing machines and watcheall measures of relative prosperity in the interior in
                    those early daywere selling well.</p>

                <p>Other vignettes from Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan.</p>
                <p>?There was a memorable, 30-foot-high statue of Chairman Mao standing in the
                    middle of the city, with right arm raised in a salute to the masses. When I was
                    there, it was surrounded by scaffolding, and there were wild rumors that it was
                    being torn down. But as it turned out, it was just being scrubbed. They hadn't
                    quite worked out their attitude toward Chairman Mao at that time, though I noted
                    that in the bookstores, the obligatory section devoted to the works of Mao had
                    tarps over the books, dust covers that had apparently not been disturbed for
                    months.</p>
                <p>There was a large family planning billboard at the main downtown intersection in
                    Chengdu. This was at the height of the one-child-per-family campaign, which it
                    later became clear was a failure in the countryside. It worked in the cities
                    where they had some control over housing, ration coupons and so on, where you
                    could really put some pressure on people. But in rural areas, it never really
                    worked very well. The billboard depicted a happy mother, father and child. The
                    text was translated into English because, as a bystander told me, “some
                    foreigners have the impression that there are too many people in China.” But the
                    English translation was unfortunate because it said, “You better have just one
                    child,” which to us sounds like... “or else?.”! I really don't think that was
                    the intent, though the history of family planning in China includes local and
                    regional officials who took drastic measures, including coerced abortions, to
                    insure one-child families.</p>
                <p>In the middle of Chengdu there was an advertising agency, a small, storefront
                    operation. Of course the concept of an advertising agency was new to begin with,
                    and it had the interesting name of “The Hundred Flowers.” — Q: A hundred flowers
                    bloomed, and then they were all chopped off. — Exactly. Chinese were in the
                    mid-1950s invited to offer their honest views on political and social
                    development“Let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought
                    contend” then were attacked and persecuted for doing so. Given campaign and
                    numerous other reversals in Chinese history, the name of the shop showed
                    remarkable faith in the new policies, or perhaps foolish bravado. On the back
                    wall of this agency was a list of services and prices, flanked by portraits of
                    Karl Marx in one corner and Lenin in the other. I couldn't find anyone to ask,
                    but perhaps they were leftover decorations from the era just past. I doubt that
                    the irony was intended.</p>
                <p>I returned to Chengdu in 1998, and in most ways it had joined the rest of China
                    in terms of consumer goods, traffic choking the streets, pollution - all of the
                    trappings of modern China. Pollution is particularly bad in that area. All of
                    Sichuan is a basin, which largely accounts for its fertility and mild climate.
                    But it also traps air pollution close to the ground, which is quite unpleasant
                    and truly bad for health.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any events during this time? Did you find - I
                        have a feeling that initially there was a cooling off period when the Reagan
                        administration came in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: There was a lot of nervousness among the Chinese about the Reagan
                    administration. Soon after I arrived in 1980, George Bush made a visit. Just
                    about the time Bush touched down, Reagan made a statement that was tantamount to
                    suggesting reestablishment of official relations with Taiwan. Bush seemed as
                    surprised and nonplused as were. The Reagan statement of course sent the Chinese
                    through the roof and cast a pall over Bush's visit. So certainly there were a
                    lot of doubts about the Reagan administration and its meaning for the
                    relationship with China. The statement also highlighted the unfinished business
                    - still unfinished today - of our arms relationship with Taiwan, and this led to
                    the excruciating negotiation of the 1982 communiqu� on arms sales to Taiwan. I
                    was not a part of that negotiation, but it was certainly part of the background
                    to life in the embassy. We could see the pressure that Ambassador Hummel was
                    under.</p>
                <p>Political concerns however did not dampen Chinese interest in foreign investment,
                    new technology and trade. The promise of the China market allowed them to turn
                    that to political advantage. For example, China was just beginning to open up as
                    an aircraft market while I was there. The Chinese were not shy about hinting
                    that an upcoming major buy of aircraft could well go to the Europeans if the
                    terms offered by the Americans were not right or if political relations turned
                    sour. The Chinese are not alone in playing that card, but the market was really
                    meaningful to Boeing. The political environment is a consistent source of
                    anxiety I think to major players in business in China.</p>
                <p>To illustrate the power of Chinese interest in the latest technology, I
                    accompanied a group of American businessmen who were selling port-handling
                    equipment, that is cranes, straddle carriers, that sort of thing. We visited the
                    major ports, about a half dozen. We were provided access that you normally
                    couldn't get and observation of the truly retarded state of modernization in
                    Guangzhou, Shanghai, Qingdao and other ports. This was clearly a product of
                    Chinese eagerness for foreign business competition and world class
                    technology.</p>
                <p>This discussion relates to one of the enduring arguments in the China
                    relationship: Is our investment and technology transfer an agent of change in
                    the Chinese system, or is it “selling the rope with which they will hang us”
                    that is, does it act primarily to strengthen the present system. There is a lot
                    of simplistic thinking on this subject, and the time horizon for some people is
                    clearly very short. I firmly believe, however, that contact with non-Chinese
                    societies will change the Chinese system, and that trade and commerce are
                    powerful agents of such contact. The change may not always be what we expect, or
                    even necessarily for the better, but isolation is not really an option.</p>

                        the foreign service and moved to the Department of Commerce. How did this
                        seem to work in the field and in an important new market? What was your
                        impression?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: In a short term sense, it intensified one of the embassy's problems, which
                    was physical space. The extent to which the embassy could expand its operations
                    was limited by the number of people, and Woodcock had put a strict ceiling on
                    that number because of the size of the chancery and the limited number of
                    apartments available, which had to be in buildings expressly designated for
                    occupancy by foreign diplomats. When I first arrived - for at least the first
                    six weeks - I didn't have a desk to call my own. I had to work off the corner of
                    someone else's; you had to see who was absent that day to see where you were
                    going to work. We didn't have permanent living quarters either. My wife and I
                    lived in one room of a hotel for seven months. We got some relief on office
                    space when a carriage house/garage behind the Ambassador's residence was
                    converted. The economic and commercial functions moved into that building.</p>
                <p>Concerning the broader issue of commercial work, I think that the breakaway from
                    State did genuinely reflect a conflict. When it belonged to State, there was
                    always competition for an officer's time when he was doing both economic and
                    commercial work, and it was usually the commercial part that came up short. In
                    my experience, State officers, starting at the top, put a higher value on
                    economic analysis than on commercial work. Perhaps it was inevitable that the
                    commercial service would split off. It probably improved our commercial work,
                    though that view was certainly not welcome at the time. It was seen as yet
                    another sign of State's atrophied bureaucratic muscle, and there was also truth
                    to that.</p>
                <p>In Beijing, the commercial service came in and a couple of the
                    economic/commercial officers in place were assigned. A commercial counselor
                    position was established. The economic and commercial functions were co-located
                    for all the time I was there, in the converted garage. There were some growing
                    pains for the foreign commercial service, globally and locally. But they
                    eventually got some good people and built up their operation. They became a very
                    effective operation within the embassy.</p>

                    Economic Affairs office. That was from '82-'83. Then from '83-'85, I was on the

                <p>LANGE: At that time, there were three deputy directors, a principal and one each
                    for economic and politicaa fairly egregious example of title inflation. I was
                    chief of the economic affairs side of the desk, which had four officers and two
                    secretaries. It was a busy time. This was still early in the relationship, but
                    we were already catching a number of things on the rebound. During the very
                    early days, we had negotiated a number of economic and trade agreements, and
                    now, four years on, it was time to either extend them or renegotiate to try to
                    fix the things that were wrong. Many of them were concluded in the haste of
                    preparation for this or that high-level visit. You know the way agreements are
                    done. They're not negotiated in a calm environment; the deal isn't cut until
                    there's pressure to do that, and usually the pressure is a high-level visitor.
                    The result is sometimes not pretty, and flaws are soon exposed. I spent a lot of
                    my time with a maritime agreement, which we had concluded in '79, which was up
                    for renewal and which wasn't working. It lurched along through a couple of
                    renewals but eventually was allowed to lapse. There are still notions that a new
                    one can be negotiated.</p>

                <p>LANGE: One of the key issues that went to the heart of the Chinese system was
                    that our carriers wanted the ability to market their services in China. On the
                    Chinese side, you had a monopoly. And the monopoly, COSCO - China Overseas
                    Shipping Company - was not about to easily give up its position. And just as we
                    signed agreements under political pressure, the Chinese did as well. They may
                    have had good intentions in 1979 were never really able to deliver on that
                    agreement. This was a constant source of grievance for our carriers. Chinese
                    grievances were related to some leftovers from the Cold War in terms of access
                    to certain U.S. ports, the fear being that it was possible to gain technical
                    intelligence in ports that were near U.S. naval bases or where U.S. naval ships
                    transited. There were a number of restrictions on Chinese access to these ports,
                    though we were able to remove most of them. The fundamental problem
                    remaineAmerican carriers could not get direct access to the Chinese economy to
                    provide services complementary to shipping. Without that, they had limited
                    ability to compete with COSCO and its lower operating costs. It was incredibly
                    time consuming and frustrating to try and get those problems fixed. Perhaps WTO
                    membership for China will help in addressing them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, problemon both sides.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: On both sides. The Chinese for their part want instant acceptance on a
                    basis, to cite their mantra, of “equality and mutual benefit.” Residual
                    limitations on port access rankled. But this couldn't be quickly fixed. In
                    general terms, in the U.S. one saw almost daily in the press evidence of
                    suspicion of the Chinese from two angles. One was a doubt that they are able or
                    intend to deliver on agreements that they make. My own feeling is that there are
                    some notable failures, but that the Chinese do about as well as most countries
                    in that regard. A second area of suspicion relates to intentions. Is China a
                    long term threat to the U.S.? Do Chinese gather intelligence as a byproduct of
                    commercial activity? It is difficult to assess Chinese intentions, but frankly,
                    I think we are inclined to overrate their intelligence abilities. In any case,
                    one hears a bit less of “China is a threat” discussion these days, perhaps
                    because other, more tangible issues are commanding foreign affairs attention,
                    but it was a significant theme 20 years ago, and it did not facilitate agreement
                    on maritime relations.</p>

                        Warrior par excellence, a great supporter of Taiwan coming from California -
                        did you feel that you were dealing rationally with China by this time, as

                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>LANGE: Oh, yes. I think there was substantial transformation in the thinking of
                    President Reagan, and this really started soon after he took office. The third
                    agreement with the Chinese, the August '82 Communiqu� on arms sales to Taiwan, I
                    think was a measure of recognition of the young Reagan administration of the
                    importance of China in our overall foreign policy. And I think that's something
                    that all administrations since '79 have recognized, or you could trace it back
                    to '72. At that time, of course, the Cold War was still a reality and a factor
                    in the U.S.-China relationship. Since '89-'90, that hasn't been a factor, and
                    that has somewhat complicated the relationship in the sense that a lot of people
                    now question whether we need China, since it no longer functions as a
                    counterbalance, as it once did, to the Soviet Union. The conclusion of the 1982
                    Communiqu� was sort of a watershed event, in that the Administration at least
                    recognized the implications of normalization. The agreement opened the way for
                    three visits at the highest level from 1883 to '85. Those visits couldn't really
                    have taken place unless, as you imply, there was a pretty rational and
                    clearheaded approach to the relationship on the part of the Reagan
                    Administration.</p>
                <p>It is worth noting here that, just as we question China's fealty to agreements,
                    the Chinese do not believe that we are living up to the 1982 Communiqu�. The
                    1982 Communiqu� set out limitations on our arms sales to Taiwan, which we have,
                    well, observed in our own way. Our official position is that we abide by the
                    terms of the 1982 Communiqu�, even though the language of the communiqu�
                    envisions that we will not increase military sales to Taiwan, and will
                    eventually terminate them. That has not happened. We maintain that one of the
                    conditions for concluding the communiqu� was our understanding that it was
                    Chinese policy to peacefully resolve the Taiwan question, but that that policy
                    has not been realized, that in fact there continues to be a threat from the
                    Mainland side. The Chinese counterargument is that while Beijing seeks a
                    peaceful resolution and has no intention to use force against Taiwan, it cannot
                    forswear the use of force, since that would be tantamount to an invitation to
                    Taiwan to declare independence. I think it is fair to say that in 1982, Beijing
                    thought that we really would gradually phase out arms sales to Taiwan. They
                    regard the facts of the matteincreased arms sales to Taiwaas a sign of either
                    bad faith or inability of a series of administrations to deliver on the 1982
                    communiqu�.</p>

                <p>Another event of the 1983-'85 period was the entry of the PRC into the Asian
                    Development Bank (ADB). This was very difficult, because Taiwan (the “Republic
                    of China”) had a seat in the ADB. Taiwan had to somehow be accommodated at the
                    same time that the PRC was admitted. It was a difficult negotiation that went on
                    for a long time, which the Koreans were active in intermediating. The outcome
                    was not bait has workebut the solution, as is often the case, wasn't wholly
                    satisfactory to either side. Taiwan still has a voice through the Korean
                    executive director, and the PRC has its seat. The PRC could not freeze out
                    Taiwan, but the price for Taiwan was to accept a new name for use in the ADB.
                    This gets deeply into the theology of China nomenclature, but the Taiwan
                    authorities believe that the name under which they now participat“Taipei, China”
                    comes uncomfortably close to an acknowledgment that Taipei is a part of China as
                    we know it today, that is, the PRC. They thought that this formulation, with the
                    comma as opposed to without, could compromise their position in nomenclature
                    battles to come. As you see, this is extremely arcane, almost nanopolicy, but
                    these issues are quite important to both sides.</p>
                <p>Many Americans feel that such things as a seat in the Asian Development Bank
                    should be a reward for good behavior and essentially for adopting an approach to
                    governance that meets our test. This is one of the reasons there's such
                    emotional support for Taiwan in the Congress and editorially because Taiwan has
                    embraced democracy and our concept of governance, while Beijing explicitly
                    rejects it. So ideologically there's more support for Taiwan today than there
                    was in '79 when Taiwan was authoritarian and under martial law. This is all by
                    way of saying I think our policy toward the PRC gradually normalized to accord
                    with our official relationship. However, the specific problems multiplied
                    because we had a broader and deeper relationship covering many different
                    areas.</p>

                        finding that they're being? or some firm wants to get in there and sell
                        goods. Did that hit you?</hi>

                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>LANGE: One of the specific issues during this period was a countervailing duty
                    case that was brought against Chinese textile imports, one of the pressure
                    points in the trade relationship. We had a textile agreement that provided for a
                    certain growth factor. But it was easily foreseeable by the late '70s and early
                    '80s that this was going to be one of the really difficult trade areas because
                    they can produce so cheaply, and because on our side we had such a vociferous
                    and effective lobby to protect domestic textile manufacturers. This was kind of
                    an imaginative filing on the part of the textile lobby. It was based on a notion
                    that Chinese textiles were being sold in the U.S. for less that “fair market
                    value,” and that compensatory, or “countervailing,” customs duties should
                    therefore be imposed. It was a complicated and difficult case to make, requiring
                    calculation of imputed costs, for example, and the factual part of it depended
                    to a significant degree on advice to the industry from a retired foreign service
                    officer who'd served in China in the late '70early '80s. He became convinced
                    that Chinese textile exports to the U.S. were vulnerable in this area. This was
                    primarily the province of USTR and the commerce department, but all of us
                    concerned with China economic affairs spent an awful lot of time on the case.
                    The Chinese had no understanding of our process, and they refused to get engaged
                    in the case, other than to exhort us diplomatically to direct that the case be
                    dropped. The countervailing duty case had broad implications for imports from
                    China across the board. It would have effectively provided another tool for
                    keeping Chinese imports out of the U.S. market, but it eventually failed.</p>
                <p>I mentioned high-level visits. One of those was by the Chinese premier, Zhao
                    Ziyang. That was really our first high-level official visitor from China. Deng
                    Xiao-ping came in 1979, but he had no official government position at the time.
                    Zhao came in January 1984, and the visit was quite successful. Zhao was one of
                    the real architects for the China economic reform, and he was a practitioner as
                    well. He was imaginative; he thought outside the box. He had been very
                    successful as a party secretary in Sichuan, China's most populous province,
                    which now has over 100 million people. As it turned out, he was a little too
                    imaginative and political. His downfall was one product of the Tiananmen Square
                    episode in 1989. He was evidently in favor of hearing the students out, but he
                    was in the minority. The leadership's position was, “We've heard enough from the
                    students; let's stop this now, before they become a threat to stability.” Zhao
                    Ziyang, who did not sign on to the decision, has ever since effectively been
                    under house arrest. But his 1984 visit here was quite successful.</p>
                <p>It was followed a few months thereafter by a visit to China by Reagan, which, as
                    you can imagine, consumed us for months in preparation. I guess the single most
                    dramatic outcome of the Reagan visit was that the White House insisted and,
                    somewhat to our surprise, prevailed in getting Reagan access to live TV in
                    China. This was a big deal; he wanted to address the Chinese people directly.
                    And that has since been a necessary component of presidential visits to China.
                    During Clinton's visit in '98, a lot of planning revolved around opportunities
                    for communicating directly with the Chinese people.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>In 1983-84, tech transfer was a huge issue. High tech exports were controlled
                    through COCOa coordinating committee made up of developed exporting
                    countries.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was basically there to prevent technical goods of
                        military value from getting into the Communist orbit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: That's right, and this was, since we had customarily been more restrictive
                    than other countries, an effort by us to get everybody together to agree on what
                    those standards should be, particularly for so-called dual use items, that is
                    things which are imported for non-lethal use but can have military applications.
                    The classic example is a supercomputer, which is used for weather profiling and
                    prediction but can also be applied to nuclear weapons design. There are many
                    others, and this effort to coordinatstandards and approach when everybody's out
                    there competing and trying to sell is very difficult. We created a separate
                    category for China, to reflect their difference from the Soviets in terms of
                    both their capability and their apparent threat. So we, along with the
                    Europeans, tried to create different standards to apply to our exports to China.
                    One of my officerone year it was Richard Boucher, another it was Steve
                    Schlaikjespent virtually all his time on this issue of tech transfer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Richard Boucher, he's now the spokesman for the Department
                        of State.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: That's right, his last assignment was consul general in Hong Kong. Back to
                    1983: We were negotiating an investment protection agreement with China. That
                    never got done. It's still resurrected fitfully, but we never have signed an
                    agreement with China, because the fundamental approach to something like the
                    protection and treatment of investment, and all of the structures that support
                    an investment climate, is just so different that it has proved impossible so far
                    to bridge the gap. The other factor is that there's plenty of investment that
                    goes into China anyway without an investment agreement. So there's limited
                    pressure on our side or on theirs to get one done.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>Another issue was civil aviation. Pan American had service to China at the same
                    time that they wanted to resume service to Taiwan. Northwest wanted to come in
                    as a second carrier, while retaining its service to Taiwan, where the market was
                    strong and growing. That was very difficult to work out, to ensure that there
                    was no discrimination against Northwest in terms of its access to the China
                    market because it had service to Taiwan. Particularly in those early years of
                    our relationship, Beijing was extremely sensitive to anything that had to do
                    with Taiwan. Beijing tried to apply pressure to companies to pull out of Taiwan,
                    but that has largely failed. Boeing sells both to Taiwan and the mainland.
                    Carriers serve both places. I think that's one of the successes of our policy,
                    that we were able to separate to a large degree commercial activity from the
                    political. We framed it as economic relations with the “people of Taiwan”. Much
                    as Beijing would have liked our cooperation in raising economic pressure on
                    Taipei, we could not go along with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what were you doing? Were you giving ammunition to
                        the Special Trade Representative or were you dealing with the Chinese
                        through the embassy on these things? How did it work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: In the case of civil aviation, of course, that's one area where the
                    department has retained primary negotiating responsibility. So in that case we
                    on the desk worked very closely with the airlines and with EB (Bureau for
                    Economic and Business Affairs), which negotiates these things, to ensure that we
                    didn't compromise any of our basic principles in negotiating with the Chinese.
                    Sometimes the airlines were almost desperate, and they may have been tempted to
                    make a calculation - should we give up Taiwan because in the long term the PRC
                    is the larger market? I think we helped give airline management the backbone to
                    resist any inclination to give up on rights to Taiwan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well this reflects in a way a battle we'd gone through for
                        a long time on the Arab boycott of any American business dealing with Israel
                        except there the political clout was such that no American company could go
                        along with the Arab boycott because of some domestic repercussions. But you
                        didn't have that particularly in the China thing, did you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Not exactly, but domestic considerations were definitely a factor. There
                    was always the potential that you'd have this domestic backlash if it were seen
                    that we had pressured or encouraged a company to acquiesce to PRC political
                    pressure and give up commercial activity in Taiwan. I think the danger of that
                    happening is very low.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>Another issue at the time of the Zhao visit was a grain trade agreement. China
                    had undertaken to buy six million tons of wheat a year, but they didn't meet
                    their commitment. Other exporters were offering competitive prices, and China's
                    crops improved. They just didn't need to import as much as they had in years
                    previous. Even though we were working against market forces, we had to keep up
                    the pressure on the Chinese, and it was an irritant in the bilateral
                    relationship.</p>
                <p>Yet another issue was peaceful nuclear cooperation. China wanted our nuclear
                    power technology, and our companies wanted badly to sell it. But we needed an
                    agreement to deal with the non-proliferation issues. It was a very difficult
                    negotiation, pitting the requirements of our Atomic Energy Act against their
                    pride and notions of national sovereignty, and given our concerns about Chinese
                    relationships with nuclear programs in Pakistan and other countries. An
                    agreement was signed in 1985, but the president did not forward the necessary
                    determinations to Congress, a requirement for implementation, until late in the
                    1990s. As far as I know, there hasn't been any actual transfer of nuclear
                    technology or materials.</p>
                <p>After the Zhao Ziyang to the U.S. and Reagan to China trips, a third big visit
                    that we dealt with during that period was the visit to the U.S. by the Chinese
                    president, Li Xiannian. The part of that visit that I was more closely
                    associated with was one of his vice premiers who came along, Li Peng, who later
                    became premier. Li Peng was well known to us because he was not then, and has
                    never since been, very friendly to the U.S. He's a Soviet-trained engineer. He
                    had a sharp tongue, very acerbic, obviously never liked us very much. He was a
                    key figure in the management of the Chinese economy. We saw this as something of
                    an opportunity - it was his first and until now only visit to the United States
                    - to open his eyes and perhaps give him a different perspective. So we gave him
                    a separate program after Washington. Strangely enough, one of the key movers in
                    this special program was the Corp of Engineers. Why the Corp of Engineers? Well,
                    at that time, planning for the so-called Three Gorges project had reached the
                    point where the Corps felt that there was a possibility for the Corps and U.S.
                    business to get involved.</p>

                    which in Washington is nearly the same as being close to the president. He was
                    urging the Corps of Engineers and the Interior Department to mount a really
                    major campaign, directed and coordinated by the Interior Department, to get a

                    included a visit to part of the Mississippi lock system in Illinois and Boulder
                    Dam in Nevada. The visit to the lock system was all right; the Chinese were duly
                    impressed with the volume of barge traffic on the Mississippi. Boulder Dam,
                    however, gave Li Peng an opportunity to exhibit his well-known sarcasm. At a
                    meeting after touring the dam, he asked bluntly, “What exactly is the point of
                    showing me this 50-year old technology?” This is not the sort of thing you want
                    to hear from a high-level visitor that you are trying to impress. This was after
                    they pulled out all the stops, with ruffles and flourishes, but he professed not
                    to be impressed, and I guess he wasn't. Similarly, there was a visit to a
                    nuclear power plant under construction near Chicago, which was idle.
                    Construction had been held up by a court case for a couple of years or so. At
                    the conclusion of the visit, he said, “In China, when we decide to do something
                    we do it. We don't wait around for a court case to clear.” I don't think he said
                    that for effect. I think he was genuinely puzzled. He really didn't understand
                    why we thought our system was superior to theirs, because theirs got things
                    done. Another visit in his program failed to impress. A Ford plant outside
                    Chicago really was a throwback to an earlier era. It looked to me like something
                    out of the '20s or '30s. It was poorly lighted, and the workers didn't manage to
                    convey any sense of engagement or efficiency. At the end of this tour, one of
                    his accompanying vice ministers said with some apparent irritation, “I've been
                    to Japan where they've shown me modern factories. Why are you showing me this?”
                    Though it is hard to say, the irritation may have been real, not feigned.
                    Remember that the background was our limitations on technology transfers to
                    China. He may have believed we were purposely showing them a second-rate
                    factory. In reality, of course, this old factory simply fit into the schedule,
                    and in truth it probably was representative of a mature industry.</p>
                <p>As you know, planning for a visit like this incorporates several objectives. I
                    think for political reasons, the White House had decided early on that Chicago
                    was one of the preferred stops, so that becomes one of the determinants of what
                    you can do. What can you arrange in the vicinity of Chicago? And given that this
                    vice minister's special responsibility was automobiles and that we had U.S.
                    companies that were interested in getting into the automobile production
                    business in China, this factory visit fell into place; you wanted to show him
                    something. As for the nuclear plant visit, there weren't many - I doubt today
                    there are any that are under construction - in that day there were darn few. So
                    we had to show him what was available.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>Another visit was to the Board of Trade, also in Chicago. I don't know if you've
                    ever been there, but it's apparent pandemonium. Buyers and sellers of
                    commodities such as grains, pork bellies, etc., are shouting orders back and
                    forth and are clearly on the emotional edge. I just looked at it as good theater
                    and as an intense expression of the market at work. As we were about to leave,
                    another of the vice ministers who was on the trip characterized the scene as an
                    example of inhuman exploitation. He reacted to the human dimension of what was
                    going on on the floor, where people were yelling in one another's face and
                    building up lots of stress. Incipient ulcers are what he saw, I guess. He may
                    however have been predisposed to be negative, because he was the one who blew up
                    on the way in at some poor Secret Service guy who didn't see his special access
                    lapel pin and tried to search him. He went into high dudgeon, a classic
                    affronted Chinese dignity act, and the Secret Service supervisor had to offer an
                    abject apology. The incident illustrated the difficulty of divining what these
                    Chinese officials were actually seeing and thinking. Was he genuinely upset by
                    his treatment or what he saw on the trading floor, or was he scoring political
                    correctness points in front of his colleagues?</p>
                <p>The final episode I wanted to mention out of that trip with Vice Premier Li Peng
                    was a stop in Silicon Valley. We visited two or three companies, and then
                    concluded with a meeting with overseas Chinese students at Stanford. We gathered
                    in an auditorium; there must have been about 100 of them, almost all in
                    post-graduate study. Some were restrained and didn't want to say much. Others
                    made some pointed observations, contrasting conditions in the U.S. and China. At
                    this point, Li said, “Look, we recognize that some of you coming to the U.S. for
                    study will be seduced by materialism and consumerism, and you won't want to go
                    back to China. That's fine; we don't want you back.” This was obviously not a
                    politician in our sense of the term, but he was a very successful politician in
                    the Communist Party context. I daresay he must have convinced 10 or 20 in the
                    audience who were wavering, “Okay, I guess we will stay in the U.S.” It just
                    seemed very ill advised for him to say something like that to a group of Chinese
                    academic elite, but he is a dedicated communist and Chinese nationalist, and he
                    apparently calculated that China was better off getting back dedicated,
                    uncontaminated nationalists, even at the cost of some brain drain. Today, of
                    course, these academic elites can pursue their materialistic dreams in
                    China.</p>
                <p>Li Peng went on to become premier. Given his reputation as a hard-liner and,
                    later, his supposed role in the Tiananmen Square events, he never got an
                    invitation to the U.S. as premier, and that was a little awkward at times. Like
                    others in the Chinese leadership, he must have had a deep ambivalence about
                    China's course. He was picking his way and trying to somehow find a balance
                    between a market system and opening up to the outside on the one hand, and the
                    state dominated system he was accustomed to on the other. This did not apply
                    only to Chinese in the leadership.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Poland in '86, what was it like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Well, this was five years on from the beginning of the Solidarity
                    movement. Intellectual life was very dynamic. There was a lot of political
                    ferment. Poles had never been comfortable under the domination of the Soviets. I
                    don't think anyone there or here could see what was coming in '89-'90 in the
                    Soviet Union. So the national effort in Poland was to find a modus vivendi with
                    the Soviets that would permit the maximum autonomy and range of movement for
                    Poland. Economically, it always had been a mixed bag. In the early post-WWII
                    years, there was an attempt to collectivize farming, but this failed. Farming
                    remained in private hands. In my work in the economic section, we dealt a lot
                    with the agricultural sector and trying to support expansion of private activity
                    in the agricultural system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we do that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Well, there was an agricultural project that was connected to the church.
                    One feature of Polish life is the close association of its national identity and
                    the Catholic Church. Particularly with the term of Karol Wojtyla, the Polish
                    pope, and his identification with the Solidarity movement, it became even
                    stronger, but throughout the whole period, the Church was very important as an
                    anchor of national identity and moral support for resistance to Soviet
                    domination. Interestingly, church membership and participation has, since I
                    left, fallen way off in Poland. I'm sure this fits into some sort of general
                    model of political science that institutions thrive in periods of shared
                    endeavor and threat but suffer from indifference when there is not this shared
                    danger. Anyway, the church agricultural project enjoyed a lot of support in the
                    U.S., including on the Hill, and eventually there was an appropriation of 10
                    million dollars for the project. We would identify activities such as financing
                    programs that would help to support private agriculture in Poland. It was
                    economically tricky because while Polish agriculture was private, it was also
                    pretty inefficient, partly because holdings tend to be so small. We have the
                    same dilemma in this country of course. The most efficient operations tend to be
                    corporate and large scale. Small, family-run farms that are under-capitalized
                    are very difficult to make efficient and profitable.</p>
                <p>One of our other preoccupations was the problem of Polish debt. Over the years,
                    they'd borrowed a lot in international markets and were from time to time unable
                    to repay. Working with IMF and with private banks, we spent a lot of time
                    working on rescheduling their debt, and this was always painful, trying to get
                    official bankers and private bankers to reschedule the payments due and to avoid
                    the acknowledgment that ultimately, their loan is not ever going to be repaid.
                    So, that took a lot of time and effort as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>Another of our jobs was to find uses for excess zlotys. We had over the years,
                    provided agricultural commodities of one sort or the other to Poland, and this
                    had generated zlotys, the national currency. These holdings had built up to
                    sizeable amounts, and they were losing value as the zloty lost value against
                    other currencies. So there was an incentive to find uses, to spend the zlotys
                    while they were still worth something. One of the projects provided funding for
                    Project Hope, which was building a hospital outside of Krakow. The problem was
                    that the schedule of the project was such that the zlotys, as their value
                    eroded, were going to run out before the project was finished. This took a lot
                    of work, with Project Hope trying to get the project done as we pushed the
                    Polish authorities to kick in counterpart funding.</p>
                <p>Poland was a popular place to visit for American political figures. They were
                    always assured of a good enthusiastic reception in Poland because America was
                    truly popular.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chicago is the second-largest Polish city.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Right. That connection plus, particularly in the '80s, we were seen as the
                    lifeline for the Solidarity Movement and Poland's bulwark against Soviet
                    domination.</p>
                <p>Bush the father visited as vice president in 1987 or 88. We went trough the usual
                    exercise in preparing for a visit like that. I did learn however of one
                    difference: Advance people for a vice president are less experienceprivate
                    citizens who are brought in from around the country to help prepare a particular
                    site visit. Every visit like this generates its share of anecdotes. One of the
                    requirements was to visit a farm. This made political sense because of our
                    sentimental attachment to the private agricultural sector. But for the visuals,
                    this also had to be a “traditional” farm, which in practical terms meant at
                    least one thatched roof. It proved very difficult to find such a farm not too
                    far out of Warsaw. We eventually found one, though the thatch on the barn didn't
                    bear close examination as it was obviously rotting and falling apart. The
                    neighbors were totally puzzled as to why we would pick this farm, which in their
                    eyes was backward and a failure. We nevertheless forged ahead, and it required
                    the usual choreography and preparation. One of my junior officers was the site
                    officer for this thing, and it was his job to ensure that the chickens were
                    pecking and clucking at the appropriate time, when the motorcade came in, people
                    alighted from the cars, and the cameras were rolling. So he befriended one of
                    the kids at the farm site, and the kid's job was to corral the chickens and make
                    sure they were deployed at the right moment. He put a lot of rehearsal time into
                    “cueing the chickens.” As it turned out, the chickens blew it. They were
                    properly cued, but their chicken wills somehow propelled them in the opposite
                    direction. That wouldn't have been allowed to happen on a presidential visit.
                    The rest of the farm site event, including a just-folks conversation at the
                    kitchen table, was successful.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>Bush came back as president for a visit to Poland in June of 1989. By that time,
                    I had a new assignment, which was as DCM in Malta. So I came back to Washington
                    and took the DCM course, then went back to work the visit in Poland.</p>
                <p>Before going on to the Bush presidential visit, let me mention a particular
                    congressional visitor. There were a number of congressional delegations, but I
                    remember Dan Rostenkowski in particular, though not because of what he did
                    there, which was to open the U.S. pavilion at the Poznan trade fair.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a Chicago congressman at one point, with obviously
                        Polish background.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: That's right. Chicago was said to be the second largest Polish city after
                    Warsaw. Dan Rostenkowski was then the powerful chairman of the House Ways and
                    Means Committee. His was in some respects a typical American second or third
                    generation experience. His adult daughter was along, and I asked her about her
                    surname, Rosten. She told me that while she was growing up, it was the practice
                    to shorten and Americanize Polish names. Then at a certain point, it became
                    politically advantageous for her father to reclaim his Polish name, but she just
                    retained Rosten. The congressman knew a few Polish dishes but could not speak or
                    understand Polish. I met a large number of people of Polish ethnicity who
                    returned to Poland and knew almost nothing about their families or their
                    background. Perhaps the war had something to do with it too. I'm sure a lot of
                    them lost people in the war.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, sometimes it skips a generation. It's the kids later on who want to pick
                    it up and find out more about it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also, the majority of people who left were probably of
                        peasant background. And they're not sitting around contemplating their

                        life, and they don't have time to keep those ties.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Well, that's true. Many Polish-Americans have roots in southern Poland,
                    from which their ancestors had emigrated for economic reasons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, in your work, were you hit with
                        Polish-American businessmen who'd come and say, “Gee, I want to do something
                        for my native land, and let's set up a barbecue company here.” You know
                        trying to do things of that nature.</hi>

                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>LANGE: There was some of that. Certainly some businessmen who had Polish
                    background were interested in doing business not for purely business reasons.
                    But the connection was much less important than Chinese-Americans doing business
                    in China, for example, where language and culture are probably more important;
                    that is, European-American culture is closer to Poland than it is to China. Yes,
                    there was some of it, but not a great deal.</p>
                <p>One more thing about Poland. 1989 was sort of the culmination of the political
                    transformation of Poland. You may recall that in 1988, I think it was,
                    roundtable discussions involving Solidarity and the government/Party had begun.
                    Solidarity just wore the Party down, and of course they were creating objective
                    problems with waves of strikes and so forth. Ultimately, the authorities agreed
                    to an election. It was quite a dramatic experience. My colleague Terry Snell was
                    political counselor at that time, and he spent much of his time covering the
                    so-called roundtable process. On the 4th of June, 1989, just before I left for
                    Malta, the elections were held. I have a great postea near life size figure of
                    Gary Cooper in “High Noon”. In Polish, it said simply, “High Noon, June 4,”
                    which Solidarity and its friends clearly saw as the time for them to make their
                    move and run the bad guys out of town. I walked around the city during election
                    day, visiting polling places, and they were very active. Solidarity had set up
                    tables outside polling places everywhere. The Communist Party rank and file had
                    by that time essentially given up the ghost. They were not doing any campaigning
                    outside the polls. Their version of campaigning was to take bundles of leaflets
                    - and of course their printing presses were still churning stuff out - load them
                    in cars and dump them out in the street, sometimes still bundled together, as
                    they drove around the city. They made no attempt to convince people face to
                    face. That was very tangible evidence of the beginning of the end of the
                    Communist era, and it was exciting!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to while you were there, was martial law still
                        on? In '86?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: No, martial law was lifted in 1982-83.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, anyway, how did we view Jaruzelski at the time? In
                        terms of key meetings and all, what was the feeling about him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>LANGE: He was an enigmatic figure, and I think he remains so to some extent
                    today. He had given the order to crack down on Solidarity in 1980 and had
                    declared martial law. At the same time, his parents had perished in the Soviet
                    Union during the war, and his own story was, and remains today, that he had
                    acted in 1980 as a patriot. That is, he did what was necessary to avoid armed
                    intervention by the Soviet Union. Some will never believe that, but I think that
                    it is possible. I think that the view of Jaruzelski within the country was that
                    whatever he did in 1980, whatever his motivations were, what he was trying to do
                    was preserve the Communist Party and its command of politics in Poland, and this
                    was not the popular will. The popular will was represented by Solidarity. The
                    ambassador, John Davis, spent a great deal more of his time with Solidarity and
                    the opposition than with the established government. I probably had more contact
                    with government figures than other people in the embassy because I was dealing
                    with the economy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of, were the officials dealing
                        with the economy in Poland, were they sort of a different breed of cat than
                        they were before? Were they pragmatic or were you up against
                        ideologues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: It was a mixed bag. You had the ideologues who had come up through the
                    Party ranks, and they couldn't think but one way. This in fact was one of the
                    issues we faced in rescheduling the Polish debt. Did we want to reschedule these
                    debts and help thereby to strengthen the party in power? Or was it better to
                    allow things to drift toward default, with all that that implied, and let the
                    system come crashing down? That was one of the philosophical issues that
                    surrounded rescheduling. Coming back to Polish officialdom, you tended to find
                    more intellectual flexibility on the part of academics, many of whom now have
                    government positions. But even in government, I had contacts ranging from people
                    who were dyed-in-the-wool Party operatives to very sophisticated people who
                    worked in the World Bank here, for example, and had gone back home and were
                    really trying to do the right thing. So there were tremendous tensions within
                    the Polish system, reflecting this range of attitudes and approaches.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see any problems or reverse sophistication on the
                        part of the Solidarity movement toward the economic side? Did economics play
                        much of a role in Solidarity?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>LANGE: Yes and no. Solidarity of course started as a labor movement and became a
                    political movement. So economics was not a core organizing principle of
                    Solidarity. We had a very close relationship with a Solidarity economist named
                    Withold Tzecziakowski, a charming gentleman with an interesting personal
                    history. He had studied as a concert pianist, and during an allied bombing raid
                    near the end of the war had suffered the loss of one of his fingers. So he had
                    to give up being a pianist and became an economist. He was one of the two
                    leading Solidarity economists. But even when Solidarity took over the
                    government, I don't think he ever had a government position, possibly because he
                    was already well along in years. Economists in Solidarity reflected a range of
                    economic approaches. This is understandable, since what brought them together
                    was not economics but the politics of opposition. For all of them, Polish
                    nationalism was more important than economic theory.</p>
                <p>Anyway, as I mentioned I returned from the DCM course back to Warsaw to work for
                    President Bush's visit in the summer of 1989. When I left to take up my new post
                    in Malta, I congratulated myself that I would, for the next three years, be
                    insulated from high-level visits. Little did I know.</p>

                <p>LANGE: Right, with a couple of exceptions. For years during the Cold War, the
                    Maltese Labor Party prime minister, Dom Mintoff, made a career of playing off
                    the Soviets against the Americans. He was something of a thorn in our side, and
                    he held office from 1971-84. Then, there was a dramatic incident that took place
                    in 1985. A hijacked EgyptAir plane landed in Malta and was eventually stormed by
                    Egyptian troops. It ended badly, with considerable loss of life, including some
                    Americans aboard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>LANGE: The ambassador when I arrived was Peter Sommer. Peter he was not a foreign
                    service officer, but he had had some assignments in government including in the
                    National Security Council. We just overlapped for about two months before he
                    left. His successor, nominated about the time I arrived, was Sally Novetzke. She
                    was Iowa State cochairman of the George Bush for President Committee in 1988,
                    and as she put it, she was one of George Bush's 500 closest friends. She had
                    never imagined that she would have an ambassadorial appointment. What she really
                    wanted to do was in the field of tourism or something like that in the Commerce
                    Department in Washington, but that was not forthcoming, so she took the
                    ambassadorial job.</p>
                <p>Before she arrived in September of that year, there was the celebration of the
                    25th anniversary of Malta's independence from Great Britain, which called for a
                    presidential delegation. They put on a big show in Malta. It turns out that the
                    principal representative for the United States was President Bush's brother
                    William, known as Bucky, who was in the private sector in St. Louis. He and his
                    wife Patty, plus former Ambassador to Malta</p>
                <p>Bruce Laingehe was charge in Tehran at the time of the hostage crisiconstituted
                    the U.S. delegation. This delegation probably had some relevance to the later
                    selection of Malta as the site for the Bush-Gorbachev summit in December of
                    1989. At some point after Sommer had left and before Novetzke arrived, while I
                    was charge, I got a call in the dead of night - 3:00 am or 4:00 am, something
                    like that - from the Department's Jeannie Bull, whose name is familiar to many
                    who have worked presidential visits. She was responsible for securing hotel
                    rooms for big events.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's probably the most important job of them all!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>LANGE: That's right! I had followed with moderate interest the discussion in the
                    press about a U.S.-Soviet summit that was going to take place aboard ship
                    somewhere in the Mediterranean. As soon as I got this call, even in my sleepy
                    state, I knew the fat was in the fire. Ground zero was Malta. I wish that I
                    could say that I was honored or that I looked forward to a momentous event, or
                    even that I was excited about a career-enhancing possibility, but at that
                    moment, with the Bush visit to Poland that summer fresh in my mind, what I felt
                    was dismay. Not surprisingly, the White House hadn't worked out any of this with
                    the Maltese. None of us knew for sure the dimensions of what was to come. All I
                    knew at that point was that I had to secure 400 hotel rooms, hopefully in
                    concert with the Soviets because they would also need accommodations. At the
                    opening of business in the morning, as Jeannie Bull had alerted me, we had
                    telegraphic instructions. I contacted the Soviet ambassador, who hadn't heard a
                    word from Moscow about Malta as the site of the summit. He agreed that perhaps
                    we should make a joint approach to the government that morning on the subject of
                    hotel rooms. But he played a very passive role in the meeting with the Maltese.
                    Understandably, he wasn't going to get ahead of instructions from Moscow. The
                    Maltese quickly agreed that they would do what they could and started
                    immediately pumping me for details, which of course I didn't have. All I had was
                    the demand for room reservations.</p>
                <p>It often falls to us in the foreign service to support these affairs, and we've
                    become familiar with the drill. The White House demands everything without
                    offering anything in return in the way of hard cash or deposits to secure these
                    rooms, or any schedule on when people would be arriving. The number we demanded
                    turned out to be wildly exaggerated. Host governments in places like London or
                    Brussels are used to this, but it took the Maltese a while to wake up to what
                    was going on. On the receiving end of a summit, this travel agent functiogetting
                    hotel rooms, making sure X is available at Y at the right time, and all thais
                    perhaps our most important function.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>One day before my new ambassador arrived, the summit survey team arrived, headed
                    by a gentleman by the name of Sid Rogich. Rogich was in real estate in Las
                    Vegas. Perhaps there are other countries that turn high-level visits over to
                    political operatives, but I don't know of any. Rogich's Maltese counterpart, and
                    my principal contact for planning, was the prime minister's secretary, a fellow
                    by the name of Richard Cachia-Caruana. He was very able, educated in Britain,
                    one of the Maltese elite. The Maltese did everything we called upon them to do.
                    Once they realized that it was not going to be offshore as originally announced,
                    but rather within reach of TV cameras and the media, which meant somewhere in
                    harbor, they were all for it. For symbolic reasons, the summit was still to take
                    place on the respective warships, the meetings alternating between one and the
                    other. The Maltese wanted the meetings to take place in Grand Harbor, which is a
                    beautiful, deepwater harbor with impressive historic resonance. Mariners have
                    used it for centuries, going back to the Phoenicians, and since the Knights of
                    Malta (more properly, the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St. John of
                    Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta) constructed their fortified city there in the
                    16th century, the sheer walls and bastions afford great views, wonderful
                    overlooks, great visuals. But the Secret Service nixed the location. The angles
                    were too great looking down; they thought it was unsafe. So they went instead
                    for a location on the Southern side of the main Malta island, a harbor by the
                    name of Marsaxlokk, which is also very nice and picturesque. It's more open,
                    it's broader and doesn't have the same sort of dramatic overlooks that Grand
                    Harbor does. The logistics would be only slightly more complicated because the
                    entire island is not all that big.</p>
                <p>We bundled the survey team into a van and went over to Marsaxlokk Harbor to check
                    the layout. One of the first routes we took gave some elevation above the
                    harbor. At a certain overlook, we all piled out of the van and Rovich got out
                    and immediately did the director's thinframing the view with thumbs and
                    forefingers. Richard, the prime minister's secretary, later told me, “As soon as
                    I saw that, I knew it was all over” as far as the Maltese having any impact on
                    the summit. Richard was a fast learner.</p>
                <p>So things started rolling ahead. The Secret Service had an overwhelming presence,
                    as it always does, in terms of numbers and assertiveness. They're extremely
                    demanding and in places where these visits take place with some frequency, in
                    Europe for example, people learn to cope with this - they push back. The Maltese
                    were babes in the woods, so they didn't know when they should push back and when
                    they shouldn't. I mention this because it becomes relevant later in the story,
                    during the phase after a high-level visit when someone has to sweep up the
                    broken crockery.</p>
                <p>One of the issues from our narrow point of view at the embassy there was the
                    relationship of this summit to the host government. What the White House was
                    really interested in, rightly of course, was the relationship with Gorbachev and
                    the Soviets. Malta just provided a venue. William Bush, who as I mentioned had
                    been there a couple of months earlier for Malta's 25th anniversary of
                    independence, had probably whispered in brother George's ear that this was a
                    really neat place to have a summit, and one supposes that is the reason it blew
                    up on our shore.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>I have to take a brief excursion to explain the Maltese political scene. It's a
                    tiny place; the population is about 300,000. Party affiliation is almost evenly
                    split between the Labor Party and the Nationalist Party. The Labor Party has
                    historically not been very friendly to the U.S., or perhaps I should say it has
                    been “aggressively neutral”.</p>
                <p>Dom Mintoff was prime minister for 13 years and developed into an art form the
                    practice of playing off East versus West. The Americans against the Soviets; the
                    Soviets against the Chinese. It seems he used or tried to use every relationship
                    in one way or another. But Labor had been voted out in 1987. In Malta, the
                    electorate is so evenly divided that a party generally prevails by only one-half
                    to two percentage points. They have an incredible participation rate: Voting is
                    not mandatory, but typically 95-96% of people vote because it's damned important
                    to them who gets voted in. They have a highly developed spoils system. People
                    can lose their job based on the outcome. The Nationalists won by a typically
                    narrow margin in 1987.</p>
                <p>In 1989, the Labor party suspected the Nationalists of engineering a Malta summit
                    in order to boost their own prestige and future political prospects. So the
                    Laborites were very negatively predisposed toward the summit, and had planned
                    demonstrations against what they viewed as a cynical ploy by the Nationalists to
                    curry favor with the U.S. and the West. That was all the White House planners
                    had to hear. Negative demonstrations always make good TV, but that was the last
                    thing they wanted, especially when the summit was not even about Malta. So the
                    notion that Bush should not come to the prime minister's office for a meeting
                    quickly took root in the advance team. Was the White House going to insist on
                    just a five to ten minute handshake meeting at the airport, or would Bush travel
                    the 15-20 minutes downtown to meet the prime minister, Eddie Fenech-Adami, in
                    his office? This was of course of considerable symbolic and political importance
                    to the prime minister. For a couple of weeks, the White House advance team held
                    firm against the office call, and the issue was in doubt. While the issue was
                    framed in the language of security, I believe that the principal concern was
                    politicathe visuals and how they would look back home.</p>

                        thing?</hi>

                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>LANGE: Oh, yes! We thought it was important to have the meeting in the prime
                    minister's office because here was a government that was finally friendly to us
                    after 17 years of Labor. Were we going to slap them in the face and give the
                    Labor Party ammunition for the next election? It seemed of some importance, even
                    to the U.S., even in Malta, to have the meeting in the prime minister's office.
                    I have to say - and I'm no advocate of political ambassadors in small posts -
                    that this is one time where it was probably useful to have an ambassador whose
                    name was at least known in the White House. She, Ambassador Novetzke, commented
                    two or three times, “If George knew what was being planned here, he would make
                    the right decision and meet the prime minister in his office.” She was
                    unfamiliar with State Department structure, and she was reluctant to go out of
                    channels, but at a certain point it became clear that the only thing that was
                    going to turn the thing around was if she was able to establish a direct
                    connection. I am a lifelong chain of command guy, but I encouraged her to do it.
                    She managed to talk to the President for five minutes on the telephone and he
                    immediately decided to come to the prime minister's office. It was obviously the
                    right thing to do. The meeting did take place in the prime minister's office,
                    and it was a great success. The bleak scenariodemonstrations, security threat,
                    really bad newall melted away. The event was so popular among the Maltese that
                    even the Labor Party stalwarts couldn't find it in their hearts to organize a
                    meaningful demonstration against it.</p>
                <p>A footnote of diplomatic history: The summit came so soon after Ambassador
                    Novetzke's arrival that there was no opportunity for her to present her
                    credentials to the Maltese president before the meeting with the prime minister.
                    Technically, she was not yet accredited to Maltwas not officially the
                    ambassadobut I don't recall that the Maltese raised any objection. The Maltese
                    set some store by ritual, but they are also pragmatists. There was of course no
                    way that we were going to let this breach of protocol stand in the way of her
                    presence at the meeting. A few members of the diplomatic corps sniffed about it
                    afterwards, but there wasn't any meaningful fallout.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to talk to the Labor people about the
                        demonstration and say, “Hey, come on fellas...?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Not at that time. I'd been there just a short time. I had made my calls on
                    the Labor Party, but I didn't know any of these people personally and they
                    didn't know us. Some of them, probably most of them, genuinely believed that the
                    Nationalists had engineered this, going back to the visit of Bush's brother,
                    that the Nationalists had put a bug in his ear and had convinced him. Of course
                    the world revolved around Malta!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well if you look at it as the Mediterranean is the center

                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>LANGE: So of course it logically follows that the location for the summit was
                    chosen solely to shore up the electoral prospects of the Nationalists. That was
                    the Labor party's take on it, and their job was to open up the eyes of the
                    Maltese electorate. They had read too much Machiavelli. It was rather difficult,
                    even when I got to know them better, to discuss the real world with the Labor
                    Party people.</p>
                <p>The meeting in the prime minister's office was the extent of contact with the
                    Maltese government at that level. After that, the President retired to the Navy
                    ship, the cruiser Belknap. Then the wind came up. The Maltese told us later that
                    if we had consulted them they could have told us that December is the worst time
                    in the year to come to Malta, because you have one chance in ten there will be a
                    really serious windstorm. And sure enough, we had a ten-year storm. One of the
                    advance team's concerns was camera anglinsuring the best profile for the cruiser
                    as it lay at anchor in the harbor. And to ensure the proper camera angle
                    required fore and aft mooring. Mariners hate fore and aft mooring.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, because you want to swing and coordinate
                        against the wind and tide and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Yes, and there wasn't a proper aft mooring at Marsaxlokk, so they called
                    up a ship chandler from Italy - of course we had a large Navy infrastructure up
                    there and an Italian contractor who performed these sorts of services - and got
                    him to come down. I don't know what the expense was, but even the Navy guys said
                    it was a lot. When you hear that from the military, you know it had to be
                    expensive. The chandler placed what they call a first-class mooring, fixed to
                    the sea bottom, in the proper location so there could be mooring fore and aft to
                    insure the correct orientation for the cruiser; that is, a favorable camera
                    angle. Later, when during the storm the wind reached a certain force and was not
                    dead on the bow, they had to do what any mariner would do, which is to cut loose
                    the aft mooring. The ship began to swing on the bow mooring, and one side effect
                    was to put White House communications off the air for a time, until they
                    adjusted to the new conditions. There was considerable angst about the President
                    being out of touch, but this never got any play in the media. Perhaps it did
                    come to the media's attention, or perhaps it was just not as newsworthy as it
                    would have been in earlier years, when the threat of a nuclear attack was
                    thought to be genuine.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>The plan of having the meetings alternatively on the U.S. and Soviet ships
                    warships never worked out. Given weather conditions, Gorbachev refused to stay
                    on board their cruiser. I'd noticed earlier that the Soviets seemed much less
                    concerned about securing hotel rooms than we were. The reason was that their
                    solution was the same they'd use for the summit in Reykjavik: They brought in a
                    passenger cruise ship, Maxim Gorky. That saved everybody's bacon: It not only
                    eased pressure on hotel space for us, but this passenger ship, tied up at the
                    dock, turned out to be the venue for the summit meetings. Bush insisted on
                    staying on the Navy cruiser, even though the meetings weren't taking place
                    there. This was another source of considerable worry because, as you can
                    imagine, even in a protected harbor, the waves were pretty substantial. The
                    cruiser was fairly stable, but of course the tender bringing the President back
                    and forth was rising and falling 10-12 feet on the waves. They broke a few
                    ladders bringing him back and forth, and of course there was some risk of
                    injury.</p>
                <p>Q: Plus the President had been a naval officer, and he was a sailor, and
                    continued to be a sailor. And of course Gorbachev was from the inland of Russia,
                    so what the hell is this all about?</p>
                <p>LANGE: There was that. I presume that the president wanted to make some sort of
                    statement for the U.S. public or the Navy, or both. The Maltese developed a very
                    reasonable backup plan for staying at a secluded villa, but this was turned down
                    by the advance team. It would have worked, but transportation, security and
                    scheduling would have been more complicated, so Bush staying aboard ship made
                    life easier for the embassy.</p>
                <p>Another wrinkle to the summit was the issue of “neither confirm nor deny;” that
                    is, our policy to never confirm or deny that a naval ship is carrying nuclear
                    arms. Sentiment against nuclear weapons was broad in Malta, not unlike in New
                    Zealand, and it bridged both political parties. The Nationalists, however,
                    didn't want to force our hanthey didn't want to push us as far as insisting on a
                    declaration, because we had made it clear to them what our answer would have to
                    be. We couldn't provide them with any assurance one way or the other. The
                    Nationalists decided on their own to suggest, in a way that would not require us
                    to either confirm or not confirm their suggestion, that they were reasonably
                    sure that this was not a nuclear-armed vessel. One of the NSC staffers on the
                    advance team thought we had to respond, but he was overruled. The statement
                    worked: The Maltese got enough cover that they did not have to defend themselves
                    to the Maltese electorate, but not so much cover that there was an issue for the
                    United States to deal with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Soviets? What kind of warship did they bring
                        in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: It was a guided missile cruiser, the Slava. It looked even more like a
                    warship than ours: its missile launchers were much more evident in profile than
                    ours.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>Q: Ours were sort of enclosed, and the doors open when the time comes.</p>
                <p>LANGE: Right. But the Soviet cruiser played no role, except that it, with the
                    American ship anchored nearby, provided a nice tangible symbol of the meaning of
                    the summit; that is, winding up the Cold War. The image, seen dimly through the
                    storm, was effective, but an equally common TV and newsmagazine visual from the
                    summit was the horizontal rain streaming past the window of the press center in
                    Valletta.</p>
                <p>I'd like to relate a final story on the summit. I mentioned that the Maltese
                    tended to roll over whenever the Secret Service suggested something. There was
                    dredging in Marsaxlokk Harbor in connection with a container port that they were
                    developing there. The construction trade unions, and all organized labor for
                    that matter, were virtually 100% Labor Party, and they were very effective at
                    organizing their people. I heard of no specific plans, but the Secret Service
                    suggested that was a security issue. The Maltese authorities quickly decided on
                    their own to suspend dredging operations and to close down construction at the
                    container port. Even before the summit was over, the Maltese started raising
                    questions about how much this was going to cost, and as soon as I passed this on
                    to anybody on the advance team, I got the classic, “We'll get back to you on
                    that.” A few weeks after the summit, the Maltese presented a bill amounting to
                    about one million dollars, which I dutifully sent back to the Department. The
                    Department was at first incredulous and dismissive, then eventually took the
                    position that the Maltese suspended work on their own initiative and were now
                    showing that they were poor hosts. I doubt that it was even discussed with the
                    White House. Payment was a non-starter, and I had to tell the Maltese that we
                    couldn't be of any help. The Maltese position was that this was something on
                    which the Secret Service had insisted. I wasn't a party to the Secret Service
                    meetings, but I have no doubt that they strongly suggested closing down the port
                    project, as they always want the optimum security package wherever they go. Some
                    things they get, and some things they don't, but in the case of Malta, I believe
                    that they got everything they asked for regardless of cost. I'm sure the Maltese
                    learned a great deal about summitry. Unfortunately, their hard-won experience is
                    probably useless: Another summit does not seem likely any time soon. As for the
                    million-dollar bill, thankfully, it didn't come up again. Perhaps the
                    Nationalists presented the bill just to protect their backside against Labor,
                    with no real expectation of payment. Or perhaps it was presented at the behest
                    of their lawyers.</p>
                <p>The Maltese were in fact proud of their supporting role for the summit. In
                    January 1991, I represented the U.S. at the prime minister's dedication of a
                    monument at Marsaxlokk Harbor to the “End of the Cold War”, and the part played
                    by the Bush-Gorbachev meetings.</p>

                <p>LANGE: The Maltese set up a big press center at their Mediterranean Conference
                    Center at the northern tip of Valletta, overlooking the Mediterranean. Our
                    public affairs officer facilitated contact between the local authorities and the
                    White House people and tried to get the White House what they wanted. The press
                    was our primary competition for hotel rooms, and they put cash on the counter,
                    whereas all we had were promises.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, sometimes when you get the attention of the world
                        press, they all encamp and they start nosing around the rest of the place
                        only because they are only getting handouts anyway, so thought pieces on
                        whither Malta and all that. How was this going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: No interest. I don't remember a single article on Malta that was generated
                    out of the Malta Summit. Some stories about the storm, but we didn't have any
                    requests for meetings with the ambassador or myself.</p>
                <p>Q: With the summit, obviously this was something that Bush and Gorbachev said,
                    hey, how about Malta or something like that? Was there ever any consideration
                    that Malta wasn't the right place and were they looking, was an alternative
                    being buffeted about?</p>
                <p>LANGE: Not to my knowledge. I don't know how they settled on a shipboard summit
                    in the Mediterranean. As I've said, my speculation is that it was our idea, and
                    that Malta was resting there in someone's frontal lobe, placed there by Bucky
                    Bush's earlier visit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was probably George Bush because he was a Navy
                        man.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Right. I'm sure the notion of Malta came from us, and as I say, the Soviet
                    ambassador as of the morning I got the call hadn't even heard it was going to be
                    in Malta. As far as I know there was never any question that it was going to be
                    held there.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>One other anecdote about the summit. I had just come from the Presidential visit
                    to Poland, where Bush demonstrated that he genuinely had a regard for embassies
                    and the work of embassy staff. Perhaps this had something to do with his
                    experience with the career service in China and at the UN. He certainly made an
                    effort in Warsaw to meet the embassy staff; he seemed genuinely appreciative. So
                    in Malta, the scenario was that Air Force One arrives at the airport and there's
                    a transfer to a limo that takes Bush into town for his meeting with the prime
                    minister. It was a logical moment for him to come over to the rope line, on his
                    way to the limousine, and I thought I had this all arranged with the White House
                    staff. I turned out the entire embassy staff, and it was a huge deal for local
                    employees. We went out to the airport and stood behind the rope line, expecting
                    that Bush would at least, if not come over, at least acknowledge us in some way.
                    It didn't happen, and I lost some face with the embassy staff. It was
                    symptomatic of the fact that Malta was just a place to have the summit. The
                    summit was the big thing, the meeting with Gorbachev. From the cosmic point of
                    view, it was understandable. From our narrow point of view at the U.S. Embassy
                    in Malta, it was disappointing.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's talk a bit about, we had gone through this difficult time with the Labor
                    Party, who'd gotten rid of the British. I guess the British, with a certain
                    amount of pleasure, had left Malta. They were dismantling their empire anyway.
                    Did you find the Labor Party, was your impression that it was sort of like, in a
                    way the left wing of the British Labor Party? Was this its genesis, extreme
                    socialists almost communists, dislike of the West and capitalism and all of
                    that. What were the roots of its stand?</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>LANGE: It was, as you described, classic Labor party. It was very heavily statist
                    oriented, though some of the very worst economic problems they had on the island
                    were not really the fault of the Labor Party, but rather to some extent a legacy
                    of the colonial period. The shipyards, after all, had started out as components
                    of Her Majesty's Navy, and they become in due course parastatal-run shipyards.
                    They did wonderful work, and they had excellent facilities. They could bring in
                    supertankers and work on them at dockside. But they were very inefficient,
                    bloated and high cost. They represented the worst aspects, or perhaps I should
                    say were the climax expression of a state-run organization or institution. The
                    Labor Party sought to protect every last one of those jobs. At the same time,
                    they took a decidedly neutral approach in external affairs, starting as I
                    mentioned earlier with the East-West aspects of that, that is the Communist
                    world and the West, playing one side against the other. They were very
                    supportive of the South in the North-South debate. Finally, they were extremely
                    critical of the Nationalist government approach to Libya. Libya was and probably
                    always will be a problem for Malta because of its close proximity. Any
                    government in Malta has to recognize that Libya is important to Malta, in one
                    way or the other. The question is how that works out. I'll come back to this a
                    little bit in terms of the Pan Am 103 investigation. The Labor Party approach to
                    Libya was that it should be treated as a friend and that Malta should be
                    supportive of Libya's government and its foreign posture. Nor did the
                    Nationalists have any wish to antagonize Libya. We didn't appreciate this
                    approach, to say the least, but it wasn't entirely unreasonable in the Malta
                    context. It's a very small country; Libya is a large country. Libya has oil, and
                    Malta gets a preferential price on oil from Libya. But the Nationalists were
                    prepared to throw in their lot with Europthe West. The Nationalists explicitly
                    wanted to become members of the EU. The Labor Party thought Malta should remain
                    as an associate member, not become full member because that would compromise
                    Malta's “neutrality.”</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>I came away from my assignment in Malta with some views about non-career
                    ambassadors in Special Embassy Program (SEP) posts. In the case of this
                    political ambassador, as I have said, she really wanted another sort of job. All
                    previous ambassadors had been career foreign service or, in the case of Peter
                    Sommer, had had a number of government jobs. They were working ambassadors. They
                    wrote reports, they made demarches, they did representation. Sally Novetzke was
                    a great person, very likeable, and she presented a favorable public image for
                    the United States. Of course that's important for any ambassador in a friendly
                    country. But she had no wish to do reporting. She very much disliked making
                    demarches, particularly unpleasant demarches. None of us liked to do that. I
                    reckon that I made about 80% of the demarches that we were instructed to make.
                    And she never quite accepted the full import of representation. She liked to
                    have events with friendly people, and that's fine, but you know, particularly in
                    an environment where there was just � percent of the electorate that separated
                    those who were out and those who were in, that was not very far-sighted. She did
                    not see the point in trying to relate to people with whom we had deep
                    ideological differences. The long and short of it was that it fell to me to deal
                    with the Labor Party, which was fine. I didn't mind it, in fact I kind of
                    enjoyed it. I established relationships with a lot of people and I hope this
                    paid off a couple of years after I left, when the Labor Party was voted back in,
                    and the people I'd had to lunch and dinner were the prime minister and his
                    cabinet. It was frustrating, and of course it added a lot to my workload, to be
                    doing all the political reporting and demarching and at least half of
                    representation.</p>
                <p>There was some collateral damage. I found it difficult to give my full attention
                    to the management side. For a variety of reasons, five different admin officers
                    passed through Valletta in the space of two years, and the embassy did not fare
                    very well on the admin side in an inspection. That reflected inescapably on
                    me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was she married? Was there a Mr.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: There was a Mr., but he stayed home running his business. He came out a
                    couple of times, but he found Malta massively boring. I think the longest he
                    ever stayed was a week and a half. He was pretty much not there, and she was
                    absent a lot too. I spent a lot of time as charge. She once put it in one of her
                    evaluations of me that for some reason she was absent during crisis periods, and
                    this did in fact seem to be the case, for example during Desert Storm or at a
                    particularly critical time in the Pan Am 103 investigation. Anyway, it's a shame
                    that this small post, which could use a career person to do the work and which
                    could add to the pool of ambassadorial posts for career people, now seemingly
                    has been lost to State.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>I should add here that I have absolutely no complaints in personal terms.
                    Ambassador Novetzke and I got along well, and working for a political ambassador
                    no doubt benefitted my career in the short term. Malta was not exactly a posting
                    that normally commanded much attention. She submitted a very favorable
                    evaluation after our first six months together, and I think that her name at the
                    bottom, combined with the substance of the Malta summit, helped me over the
                    threshold into the Senior Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>I alluded a couple of times to the Pan Am 103 investigation. Pan American
                    Airlines flight 103 broke up in midair and fell to earth in Lockerbie, Scotland,
                    in December 1988. The investigation quickly established that a bomb was on the
                    airplane, which was what brought it down. Early phases of the investigation
                    focused on the Iranians. Speculation was that it was retaliation for our
                    mistakenly shooting down an Iranian airliner a couple of years previously. The
                    investigation went down various tracks. The Palestinians came on the screen
                    briefly. They had a mission in Malta. The Libyans also had some grievances with
                    us because in 1986 we had retaliated for the discotheque bombing in Germany by
                    launching a bombing raid over Tripoli, and one of the bombs killed Qadhafi's
                    adopted daughter. There was at the outset no shortage of potential suspects
                    around the world.</p>
                <p>Eventually, the forensic investigation, which was a really remarkable piece of
                    work, zeroed in on Malta as one of the possible points where the bomb had been
                    introduced into the baggage system. What led to this was the finding, at the
                    crash site in Scotland, of some clothing fragments, which it was determined had
                    been near the explosive device, probably in the same suitcase. The fragments
                    were traced to certain garments, which were in turn traced to a manufacturer,
                    and the manufacturer had sold those garments to a limited number of buyers. One
                    of the buyers of those garments was a very small clothing shop in Malta. It
                    happened that the proprietor of that shop had recalled selling several garments,
                    including those in question, to some people that he remembered as having been
                    from Libya. The Maltese language is Semitic, closely related to Arabic, although
                    Maltese is written in a Western script. Spoken differences are also substantial,
                    but they can make one another understood. In any case, the proprietor identified
                    the buyer as Libyan, and serious investigation launched from there. The FBI sent
                    some people to Malta who took up residence in an office of the embassy for over
                    a year. This was an important part of the investigation, and we'll see a lot of
                    this come out in the trial when it's finally kicked off in Holland.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>The FBI identified one current and one former employee of Libyan Airlines as
                    Libyan intelligence people. They acquired photos of these people and showed them
                    to the proprietor in a photo lineup, and amazingly enough, he remembered these
                    people anwhat they had bought. This established a key link. The theory, which
                    will be tested in court, is that based on their connections at the airport
                    through Libyan Airlines, they introduced a briefcase with the bomb, and a
                    detonator with a timing device. That bag was loaded onto a flight to Frankfort
                    where it was offloaded and transferred to Pan Am flight 103, bound for Heathrow
                    and on to the U.S. This was at a time when there was a very tenuous, shall we
                    say, control over unaccompanied baggage. It was supposedly impossible to put on
                    unaccompanied baggage, but there seemed little effort to enforce that
                    restriction. At any rate, the briefcase was transferred to Pan Am 103, which
                    went on to Heathrow. The timing device was set to detonate when the plane was
                    over water, in which case the evidence would have been unrecoverable. But the
                    flight was delayed, so the bomb went off early in the flight, while it was over
                    land. The timing device was traced to a maker in Switzerland, and the purchase
                    was supposedly traced to the Libyan intelligence service.</p>
                <p>This was all very tricky to handle with the Maltese, for reasons over and above
                    the usual sovereignty sensitivities of an investigation in a foreign country.
                    First, they didn't want to appear to be siding with the U.S. and Britisthe FBI
                    was pursuing the investigation jointly with the Scottish Policin prosecuting or
                    furthering this investigation, pointing a finger at the Libyans. Secondly, they
                    were concerned about the effect that an image of terrorist operations could have
                    on their tourism trade, which of course is important to Malta. It happened that
                    the foreign minister and concurrently deputy prime minister, Guido de Marco,
                    later to become Malta's president, had made his name as a defense lawyer. He was
                    more than ready to exercise his cross-examination skills, particularly when we
                    (that usually meant me) went in with a demarche related to the investigation.
                    The Maltese eventually did the right thing, but we had a reluctant host
                    government, and it was difficult to ensure their cooperation. Our intelligence
                    agencies were, of course, interested in the investigation, which added another
                    complicating dimension. I won't say more about this, but perhaps some of it
                    might come out at trial. Finally, since it was a joint investigation, we had to
                    do everything vis-�-vis the Maltese in tandem with the British government. It
                    was not always easy to keep everybody on the same page and steer clear of the
                    jealousies between the Scottish police and the FBI. But all told, it was a
                    remarkable investigative effort.</p>
                <p>Q: How did the Gulf War affect you? We're talking about when Iraq invaded Kuwait
                    and this engaged the energy of both the United States and Europe.</p>
                <p>LANGE: We had to deliver a lot of demarches on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say a demarche, can you explain what you
                        mean?</hi>

                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>LANGE: We made representations to the Maltese government in the form of
                    statements of our policy, and requests for information, action or statements of
                    Maltese policy. In the case of the Gulf War, we had Security Council resolutions
                    to back us up on the shipping of certain materials, particularly military
                    materials, to Iraq. Some shipping went through Malta, and there was a lot of
                    Maltese-registered shipping in all parts of the world. It was particularly the
                    stuff that went through Malta that from time to time interested U.S. agencies.
                    In making these demarches, we had to deal with the same defense lawyer, that is
                    the foreign minister/deputy prime minister, de Marco. He applied a very strict
                    legalistic interpretation of the Security Council resolutions, demanded elements
                    of proof, and in general seemed to make it as difficult as possible to pursue
                    questions regarding shipments going through Maltese ports. One should
                    acknowledge that the Maltese government had to deal with the unions on the docks
                    and the shipping companies, which were not always sympathetic to the Nationalist
                    government, to say the least. So the Nationalists had their own fish to fry in
                    terms of domestic politics. Basically these were not in themselves important
                    episodes involving significant quantities of proscribed materials. They involved
                    instead issues of principle, of assuring that all members of the Security
                    Council were abiding by the terms of the resolution. There was no instance in
                    which there were any obvious violations of Security Council resolutions.
                    Overall, the Maltese were not enthusiastic supporters of Desert Storm, but to
                    the extent they had a role to play, I would say that they acted correctly.</p>
                <p>Q: Were they, as so many countries, was CNN [Cable News Network] being seen
                    there? Because it became probably the world's greatest spectator sport, almost,
                    watching the war being played out.</p>
                <p>LANGE: They did not have cable in Malta while I was there. They were negotiating
                    with some companies, including an American company, to install cable. Broadcast
                    TV was local or came over the water from Italy. On arrival in Malta, one
                    immediately received two strong visual impressions. First, it presented a
                    dominantly ochre landscape, because all of the buildings were built of
                    limestone, which was quarried in Malta. This was particularly striking during
                    the dry season, when there was no green to relieve a uniform hue of hot yellow.
                    The other visual image was on the skyline, where there was a forest of
                    television antennae pointed toward Italy. You probably recall, as I do, the old
                    days of a TV antenna on the roof. Multiply that by several times, because
                    Maltese housing units are much smaller than American. The forest was dense
                    indeed. In any case, the Italian channels did not provide American-type
                    coverage, and without cable, the Maltese didn't have access to the “video game
                    war”.</p>

                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>LANGE: A lot of people understood Italian - partly because that was the TV they
                    got, partly because of the proximity - but it wasn't used very much. In the
                    marketplace, you would hear either Maltese or English. I would say 90% of the
                    people could speak English, but few could speak Italian. On the other hand, the
                    legal system was derived from Italy, which is curious because you would have
                    thought it would have been an English legal system. In terms of current
                    relations, the Italians provided the only meaningful military assistance. It was
                    very modest, but they provided assistance in the form of material, including
                    uniforms and that sort of thing. But they got very little mileage out of their
                    assistance; they didn't seem to have much influence in terms of policy or
                    anything. The British were much more influential than the Italians. We managed
                    to arrange donation of a couple of retired NOAA (National Oceanic and
                    Atmospheric Administration) patrol craft to the Maltese military as patrol
                    boats. We got quite a bit of favorable publicity. The Italians were just taken
                    for granted.</p>

                <p>LANGE: The December 1989 summit, when the USS Belknap came into Marsaxlokk
                    Harbor, was probably the first U.S. naval ship in Maltese waters since Maltese
                    independence in 1964. I believe that after 1989, visits took place from time to
                    time, but I don't know if they continued under the Labor Party government.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Yes, the Libyans certainly had a presence there. They had significant
                    number of visitors from Libya and a regular ferry service to Libya and back.
                    Libyans would often come over and buy things they couldn't obtain in Libya. I
                    remember tires were a big item for some reason; they were not readily available
                    in Libya. They had an embassy comparable in size to oursmall by our standards,
                    big by theirs. They had a public affairs program that engaged primarily in
                    distributing literature. The Libyans sent high-level visitors from time to time,
                    at the vice minister and ministerial level. So they definitely had a presence in
                    Malta. The ambassador appeared to be a reasonable person. We had little to do
                    with him, but he wasn't overtly hostile. The typical Maltese was not very
                    interested in Libya or Libyan culture. Most Maltese are oriented toward Europe.
                    Among the Nationalists particularly, many Maltese thought of themselves as
                    Europeans. Even within the Labor Party, strong as its political impulse toward
                    neutrality, few considered themselves to be North Africans.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LANGE: The Catholic Church had a lot of property, and the main job of the papal
                    nuncio was to negotiate the fate of that property. He spent all of his time on
                    it. I don't remember exactly the nature of their holdings. Their mission there
                    was not very imposing, but they swung a lot of weight through the Church and by
                    virtue of their property holdings. The Pope visited while I was there. That was
                    a huge event. Again, the Nationalists arranged the invitation, and I'm sure that
                    they welcomed the political dividend. On a local level, the influence of the
                    Church was substantial, in the old-fashioned way. There were numerous churches
                    around the island, and the parish church had tremendous influence. Many village
                    churches had annual festivals, and they were huge events. We had the good
                    fortune to live in an old villa, which dated from 1709 and which was located
                    about 25 meters from a church. It was a mixed blessing at the beginning because
                    the bells started at 6:00 am and went on regularly. The Maltese told us we would
                    get used to it. We didn't believe it, but we did in fact get used to it in a few
                    weeks. Still, you couldn't carry on a conversation out in the garden while the
                    bells were pealing. The festival at our local church built up to a climax for a
                    couple of weeks in late summer. There were fireworks and bells throughout this
                    period, and during the two days of the actual festival, it was just nonstop
                    cacophony. The Maltese love their fireworks. Nobody could quite explain this to
                    me, but they spent a lot of treasure on fireworks, which went on sort of all
                    year around. They produced them in backyard factories, which would occasionally
                    blow up, with injury or loss of life. At the same time, a lot of Maltese had
                    very bad memories of the siege of Malta during World War II, when things really
                    got desperate. The Germans blockaded the island. The Maltese ran short of food
                    and fuel. There was regular bombing of Malta. So one might have thought that
                    they had bad memories of explosives. Yet they had this drive to spend lots of
                    money on fireworks. Most realized that it was an expensive, sometimes annoying
                    and occasionally dangerous obsession, but campaigns to ratchet back the
                    fireworks fell on deaf ears.</p>

                <p>LANGE: In spite of the privations, a number of the older people had some fond
                    memories from the war. Perhaps because of the privationshared burdens, a common
                    enemy, all of that. An interesting WWII story: At an especially critical time in
                    1943, during the siege of Malta, a number of U.S. ships had been turned over for
                    use in supply convoys into Malta. One of those was the tanker Ohio, which had a
                    load of kerosene, important for cooking and other uses. It had been struck by
                    torpedoes and twice abandoned during the convoy, but it didn't sink and was
                    taken under tow. A famous picture is taken from the parapets above Grand Harbor.
                    The Ohio, half awash, is being nursed into port with a warship on each side.
                    They managed to get it in, even though its back was broken, and offloaded most
                    of the kerosene. The Ohio became a source of inspiration at a dark time.</p>
                <p>Another thing I could mention about Malta, that sort of relates to the summit.
                    The Soviet mission had just built a new chancery; in fact, a complete compound.
                    The Maltese were kind of bemused by the complex, which was on a hill and
                    surrounded by an imposing and threatening fence topped by downward-pointing
                    spiked metal apparatus.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Exactly. The Maltese joked that they should have been pointed the other
                    way to keep the Russians from getting out. The Soviets in 1989 were at the time
                    very preoccupied by what was going on within the Soviet Union, and it was
                    sometimes hard to get their attention. I remember summit planning meetings that
                    we would have there, and Soviet embassy officers would sort of break off and go
                    into a corner to argue about what was going on in the Soviet Union. There was
                    the mix of personnel that you would find in many Soviet embassies; it was large
                    enough to have people from the republics and indeed from all over the Soviet
                    Union. They became embroiled in their own intramural arguments at the time we
                    were trying to plan for the summit. It was a curious time for them, and they
                    were running short of money. They had this grand compound, and they appeared to
                    lack money to maintain it and keep it running.</p>
                <p>The Chinese also had a sizeable compound, and they also apparently had to pinch
                    pennies. As we used to say back in Nebraska, both the Soviets and the Chinese
                    were “house poor.”</p>

                    embassy with a 100-foot setback.</p>

                <p>LANGE: Tourism was mainly European and mainly British, i.e., the budget British
                    traveler. The Maltese were trying to upgrade, trying to get more Scandinavians,
                    people willing to spend a little more. They had a limited number of
                    international class hotels. One of their flagship hotels, the Phoenician, was
                    badly in need of refurbishing. I stayed there for a week when I first got there.
                    It was beautifully situated, just outside the walls of the fortified city of
                    Valletta. The hotel closed over a labor dispute shortly after I arrived and had
                    still not reopened when I left. The islands didn't have much in the way of
                    beaches, a couple were okay, but not great. Malta was on the other hand very
                    interesting from the standpoint of archaeology. It had some beautiful Neolithic
                    temples surrounded by a certain amount of mystery. They're still finding about
                    the people who built these wonderful, old megalithcomparable to but even more

                    Intellectual Property for the State Department. It's a rather arcane subject,

                    but I don't know if he ever reached a point where he wanted to publish.</p>
                <p>There were two aspects of the job that absorbed most of my energy. One was our
                    interface with the World Intellectual Property Organization, located in Geneva,
                    which goes by the wonderful acronym WIPO. It is a UN-affiliated agency, and it
                    administers something like 17 international agreements having to do with
                    intellectual property. It was sort of a special animal because it generated a
                    lot of income on its own from fees it charged on filing of patents. It had a
                    beautiful, relatively new headquarters building overlooking Lake Geneva. WIPO
                    was very well off and was the envy of other UN officials in Geneva. This
                    actually corresponds to the situation with respect to our own Patent and
                    Trademark Office, which generates income from patent fees and which as an
                    institution lives better than other government agencies.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>WIPO had been headed for many years by an American citizen by the name of Arpad
                    Bogsch. He was originally from Hungary, had spent some years in the U.S., but
                    most of his working life had been in Geneva. He was secretary-general of the
                    organization, and he ran it with an iron hand. He was a good secretary-general
                    from our policy point of view, and we managed to keep him in the position during
                    my tenure. We began work on negotiating new international arrangements with
                    respect to copyright, to address the new copyright environment created by the
                    Internet and new technology that change the questions you ask with respect to
                    protecting intellectual property. I can't pretend that I ever became expert in
                    this arcane field. The real experts are in the Patent and Trademark Office, the
                    Office of the Register of Copyrights, which is a function of the Library of
                    Congress, and to a lesser but increasing extent the Office of the U.S. Trade
                    Representative. Collectively, they are the ones who were principally responsible
                    for negotiating in this area.</p>
                <p>The other focus of the office was the trade aspect of IPR. A lot of effort here
                    revolved around the so-called Special 301 provisions of our Trade Act. The trend
                    toward making IPR a trade issue was resisted by some. But it became very
                    explicitly a matter for our trade negotiators to pay attention to, and one of
                    our tools to force governments to take seriously protection of IPR was trade
                    retaliation. Consumers in other countries were feeding off our intellectual
                    property products. Our producerthe recording industry, the software producers,
                    the motion picture industry represented by Jack Valentwere extremely effective
                    and influential in attacking piracy of IP. The tool of choice was the Special
                    301 provision. Every year, countries would be assessed with respect to their
                    effectiveness in protecting IPR. The law itself provided only for identifying a
                    country that was not doing an adequate job of protection, and was therefore
                    subject to trade retaliation in the form of punitive tariffs on selected imports
                    from such a country. This action was to be taken only in extreme instances,
                    preceded by a number of other steps. Part of the expression of this law, as it
                    developed over the years, was the separation of malefactor countries into three
                    tiers: watch list, priority watch list, and priority foreign country, the latter
                    being the most egregious category and a designation that could trigger
                    retaliation. The list was revised and renewed annually. The system worked
                    remarkably well. Countries would take their position on the list quite
                    seriously, and this afforded us leverage to negotiate IPR protection. Naturally,
                    it also became an issue in bilateral relations. The IP industry was extremely
                    demanding and aggressive. USTR was responsible for putting the list together,
                    and it had very close relationships with all of the IP lobbies. USTR would
                    essentially carry the IP industry message to foreign governments in terms of
                    measures they should take with respect to protecting intellectual property.
                    Well, that may be overstating the matter a bit, but the message we delivered as
                    a government was frequently the industry message, not much adulterated.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>Each country presented a different problem. In Italy, for example, it was Disney
                    videos. For some reason, Italians just loved pirating Disney product. So the
                    weight of Disney was brought down on the Italians. From our point of view, Italy
                    became a success story, partly because the Italians responded. They took it on
                    board. We had a meeting with the Italians, and they outlined a program, part of
                    which was for public consumptiomaking a big TV event of rounding up pirated
                    videos and running over them with steamrollers, that sort of thing, all good
                    theater. But they made a serious and effective effort to get on top of the
                    problem.</p>
                <p>Countries at the other end of the spectrum had no interest in protecting
                    intellectual property. Their perspective was that the recording companies for
                    example are becoming wealthy and they charge too much for tapes and CDs. “We're
                    a tiny little market so why should we go out of our way to protect intellectual
                    property?” We had to convince them that if they didn't, they'd be slapped with
                    retaliation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about some of the larger countries, particularly
                        China and Thailand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: China became the big issue during the time I was in this office. Taiwan
                    was also a problem, and this went back for years, starting with books, moving to
                    sound recordings, then to visual recordings. But part of the story with Taiwan
                    is that as it became more prosperous, it developed a domestic constituency for
                    protecting its own national product, and it turns out that's rather important.
                    The same thing happened with Korea. They became interested domestically in
                    protecting intellectual property rights, and that helps a lot. We're not in the
                    position of saying, “Protect it for us!” We're saying, “Protect it for yourself
                    as well.” An element of our mythology, going back to the early days of the
                    Republic, is that protecting intellectual property rights inspires creation of
                    intellectual property. Well, yes sometimes it does, but not always, and in my
                    humble opinion, it is possible to carry protection too far, beyond the point of
                    diminishing returns. (For example, copyright protection 70 years after the death
                    of the original copyright holder.) But to return to the main point, it is
                    certainly true that if you get an interest group made up of artists, authors,
                    inventors and others, it helps to sell protection of IPR.</p>

                <p> had a bit of exposure to the influence of domestic IPR stakeholders in Malta.
                    Talk about a tiny market. The concern started with videos and audio cassettes.
                    You could buy any cassette in the open markets in Malta, and they were always
                    pirated. You couldn't buy or rent a legitimate video there. All the videos we
                    watched at home for three years were pirated. The Maltese approach, not
                    surprisingly, was, “Look, these are available at a fraction of the cost of
                    legitimate products. We don't do the pirating, and our people are poor.” Many
                    countries take that approacthat their people can't afford the legitimate
                    product. In Malta's case, they didn't believe, with some reason, that sale of
                    pirated products there had much impact on the world market. We began to make
                    some progress, though, and one thing that helped was a fairly influential guy
                    who wanted to open a multiplex cinema. He wanted to show legitimate movies and
                    make a profit. It was against his interest to have immediately pirated videos in
                    the market, if he was going to be showing the same movies in his multiplex. So
                    that, combined with our threatand like the proverbial mule, to get their
                    attention you had to hit them with a two by fougradually persuaded them to take
                    the problem seriously. No government wants to address this politically unpopular
                    issue: they all want to ignore it and hope that it goes away.</p>

                <p>This is August 22, 2000. So we're in 1994; you're on the Taiwan desk. Can you
                    explain how the Taiwan desk at this pointhis is at maturithow it fit in. It's a
                    country we don't recognize and all that. Explain the setup.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>LANGE: In 1979, in connection with shifting our official recognition from Taipei
                    to Beijing, we worked out this seemingly simple but in practice rather elaborate
                    and tortured arrangement that implements an unofficial relationship with Taiwan.
                    What that means in practice is constantly subject to redefinition because there
                    aren't really any models for this. The interpretation of what it means, among
                    both politicians and policymakers, ranges over a fairly wide field. We created
                    the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) in 1979. AIT is charged with carrying
                    out, administering, the relationship. It actually has a corporate identity and
                    is incorporated in the District of Columbia. From the beginning it was
                    envisioned that AIT would provide the means of managing the relationship in a
                    way that can be portrayed by all parties as unofficial while providing for what
                    has become in practice a vibrant relationship. The nature of AIT, this
                    understanding that it would be private yet quasi-official, requires a certain
                    level of understanding by all parties. This, during my tenure, sort of broke
                    down on the U.S. side.</p>

                        explain where it fit? I mean here you have this American Institute sitting

                        of it, and then we'll talk about the Taiwanese side of it. Can you explain a
                        little bit about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>LANGE: You really have three loci to contend with, in Taipei, in Rosslyn, and in
                    the State Department. In Taipei, you have the Director of the American Institute
                    in Taiwan (AIT), Taipei. In Rosslyn, you have the Chairman of AIT, who is the
                    corporate chairman. In the State Department, you have the whole policy
                    structure, with a small office headed by the “Taiwan Coordination Advisor” in
                    the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs (EAP). There is no “director” of
                    the “Taiwan desk”, because desks (country directorates) are for countries, and
                    we don't recognize Taiwan as a country. So I was Taiwan coordination advisor. I
                    worked directly for a deputy assistant secretary in EAP, who was at that time in
                    charge of China and other countries, who reported to the assistant secretary,
                    and so on up the line. The principle was that we attended to policy with respect
                    to Taiwan, while AIT actually administered the relationship. This means that in
                    Taipei, AIT issues visas, helps businessmen, and in general does everything that
                    an official foreign mission does. In Rosslyn, you have a small establishmenAIT
                    Washington, or AIT/that manages the Washington end of the relationship. That is,
                    it interfaced with the unofficial Taiwan representation in Washington, which
                    from 1979 to 1994 went by the obscure name of the Coordinating Council for North
                    American Affairs. We managed to change this name, and I'll describe the
                    circumstances later. AIT/W also has a role in public affairs, particularly in
                    dealing with Taiwan oriented groups around the country, so it has to be careful
                    to accurately reflect official policy. AIT/W deals with Taiwan representatives
                    here, and it also, importantly, formulates the annual budget for AIT. AIT has a
                    separate budget, approved each year by Congress, separate from that of the State
                    Department budget. The budget covers personnel costs as well, because nominally
                    every one who serves in AIT has to resign from the Foreign Service and join AIT.
                    At the same time, this resignation is covered by an understanding that there are
                    no career costs involved. That is, your salary remains the same, you can be
                    promoted, your longevity clock keeps running, and you have guaranteed
                    reemployment in the State Department, with no loss in seniority.</p>

                        surrounding political leaders and very interesting political situations.
                        Were they doing these things? And how did they do those?</hi>

                <p>LANGE: It really operates like any mission abroareporting, presenting demarches,
                    etc. Now in the early days, there were a lot ohow shall I safirewalls
                    constructed to make it as plausible as possible that this was an unofficial
                    entity operating in an unofficial way. State Department telegrams, for example,
                    were nominally from “AIT Washington” to “AIT Taipei”. Of course, the fact is
                    that you need to manage the relationship, and you need to have it operate in a
                    way that's consistent with U.S. policy. For example, Taiwan's “foreign ministry”
                    (note the quotation markstrictly speaking, if we do not consider an entity a
                    county, we should not refer to its foreign ministry) calls up AIT in Taipei. The
                    director or another AIT official meets as requested, and results are reported
                    back to the Department.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Well, actually you can. We can't deliver a “note”, which is a diplomatic
                    instrument, to a Taiwan representative, but we did our business in unofficial
                    settings. Much of the time of the Taiwan coordination advisor, my job from '94
                    to '96, and his small staff of three people is spent working out elaborate rules
                    and guidelines for contact. Much of it I must say appears petty to us. But it is
                    important symbolism to both Beijing and Taipei, so it must be attended to. The
                    way it works out in Washington is that Taiwan's representatives could not enter
                    the State Department. That rule preserved a certain measure of unofficiality. Of
                    course they could meet with AIT people at any time, anywhere, except the State
                    Department. When I prepared my assistant secretary, who from 1994 to 1996 was
                    Winston Lord, for a meeting with Taiwan representatives, that meeting would take
                    place, under AIT auspices, in the State Plaza Hotel, which is across the street
                    from the State Department.</p>

                <p>LANGE: Taiwan would pay for a meeting room. Everyone understood that a meeting at
                    that level would take place there. Meetings could take place at the AIT offices
                    in Rosslyn as well, and some did take place there, usually at a lower level. But
                    it would be inconvenient for the assistant secretary to cross the river and go
                    up to the AIT offices.</p>
                <p>We followed different rules with respect to other departments. From the
                    beginning, we tried to establish the principle with Beijing that certain
                    elements of the relationship, particularly in the economic area, had no policy
                    significance and were necessary to carry out an effective relationship with
                    Taiwan. Our case was that to have good coordination with Taiwan in finance and
                    trade, it is clearly in the interest of the Asian, and indeed the world economy,
                    in everybody's interest to have effective coordination, and so we need to have
                    contact at all levels. Sometimes that might even require a meeting with a
                    cabinet secretary. Of course Beijing never explicitly agreed with this approach.
                    But at the same time that we maintained that we needed to have such meetings,
                    including occasionally at a cabinet level, we thought that it looked rather
                    official if a Taiwan minister of the economy, for example, comes in and calls on
                    Secretary Rubin in his Treasury Department office. Therefore we determined that
                    those meetings should not be in the cabinet member's office. You can easily
                    imagine how much effort and blood was spilled on the floor trying to enforce
                    this guideline on departments that had little understanding and less sympathy
                    with our Taiwan problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>That was one of the issues addressed in the so-called Taiwan Policy Review in
                    1994, which was just approaching implementation at the time I took over the
                    office. Pursuant to the review, cabinet secretaries are now permitted to have
                    meetings in their office. This sort of rulemaking and enforcing, which to most
                    Americans looks petty, unproductive, and even pusillanimous, took up an awful
                    lot of time and effort. But we thought that some of it was necessary to preserve
                    the principle that we were serious about not having an official relationship
                    with Taiwan.</p>
                <p>In many ways, and on almost a daily basis, we confronted the tension arising from
                    different policy objectives: Our wish to have unofficial yet dynamic relations
                    with Taiwan; Taiwan's effort to raise its international profilto gain more
                    international space; and Beijing's adamant opposition to any event that would
                    enable Taiwan to avoid coming to the table to negotiate its future as a part of
                    “one China”. For example, Taiwan sought the highest possible U.S. representation
                    at the annual meeting of the U.S.-ROC Economic Council, a group composed of all
                    the important businesses involved in U.S.-Taiwan economic relations. Our job was
                    to identify a cabinet or sub-cabinet level official in the economic area to
                    participate, one who covered an area where Beijing would think twice about
                    retaliating. One year, we sent Secretary of Transportation Pena to the Taiwan
                    meeting, reasoning that Beijing had important transportation interests and would
                    not be inclined to shut down communications with our transportation secretary or
                    retaliate in a more tangible way. Still, Beijing responded by refusing to let
                    Pena travel to China. For Taiwan, this annual U.S.-ROC Economic Council exercise
                    was about equal parts substance and symbol. For Beijing, it was wholly
                    symbolic.</p>
                <p>Another area where these differing policy objectives clashed was participation in
                    international organizations by Taiwan. The 1994 Taiwan Policy Review, to which I
                    previously referred, committed us to find organizations where Taiwan's
                    participation might be possible and to help promote entry, or at least allow
                    “its voice to be heard”. This particular outcome of the Review probably grew out
                    of the successful effort in the early 1990s to secure Taiwan's participation in
                    the Asia Pacific Economic Coordination forum (APEC). A high-ranking economic
                    official from Taiwan took part thereafter in the annual APEC meeting, and Taiwan
                    participated in subsidiary organizations. The agreement that opened the door to
                    that participation, however, did not extend to a “Leaders' Meeting” associated
                    with the APEC meetings, and which typically drew heads of government. Beijing
                    drew the line there; it was absolutely opposed to letting Taiwan's president
                    take part in the Leaders' Meeting. As we soon learned, there are no other
                    organizations like APEC, which could be viewed as a gathering of economies, not
                    countries. Other international organizations were either affiliated with the UN
                    or otherwise required statehood for participation. The PRC was firmly opposed to
                    Taiwan participation in such organizations, and it could easily mobilize the
                    votes by other country members to keep it out. From Beijing's point of view,
                    permitting this camel's nose under the tent would be yet another encouragement
                    to Taiwan's independence.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>Taiwan has done little to make this easy. Since the early 1990s, it has pursued a
                    seat at the UN, using the 28 or 30 countries with which it has official
                    relations. It doesn't have a chance, and the effort has heightened Beijing's
                    sensitivity and its resolve to fight tooth and nail any notion that Taiwan was
                    going to get a seat in an international or UN-affiliated organization. We
                    explored observer status in the WHO, for which there was precedent for non-state
                    participation (e.g., the PLO). Beijing was uncompromising. So we spun our wheels
                    but found nothing, even among obscure and highly specialized organizations.
                    Members of Congress, not surprisingly, thought we were not really trying; that
                    we could work our will if we really wanted to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would imagine, particularly after the 1989 Tiananmen
                        Square episode, that: 1) relations weren't that great with China; and 2)
                        that Beijing's continual carping about these little niceties of who meets
                        who when and where and all that were beginning to run a little sour as far
                        as we were concerned, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Yes, and that applies particularly to the Congress and to editorial
                    writers. Going back to 1972, when the Shanghai Communiqu� expressed our
                    intention to “normalize” relations with Beijing, and 1979, when we shifted our
                    recognition from Taipei to Beijinthese policy decisions were rooted in a
                    strategic assessment that we needed an official relationship with the “new”
                    China rather than with the China that had lost the civil war in 1949. A
                    relationship with the PRC was useful to us as a counterbalance to the Soviet
                    Union. Also at that time, in terms of the nature of the two regimes, there was a
                    lot less to differentiate Taipei from Beijing than there is today. Until well
                    into the 1980s, the Kuomintang followed policies and principles that would have
                    been very understandable in Moscow and in some cases can be traced back to
                    Comintern agentmost famously Mikhail Borodiwho visited China in the 1920s. The
                    organization of the KMT, and its intolerance for dissent, did not make it
                    exactly a model defender of human rights, to say the least.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>Then in 1989, we had Tiananmen and in the same year, the fall of the Berlin wall,
                    and shortly thereafter, the collapse of the Soviet Union. So changes in our
                    strategic calculations and in our emotional attitudes coincided. We didn't need
                    Beijing quite as much as we had before. The other thing that happened was that
                    out of necessity, the government in Taipei, and more importantly the KMT, began
                    a genuine process of democratization. After WWII, the KMT was a party that had
                    dumped itself in Taiwan after losing the civil war on the Mainland, was a
                    minority party, and was seen as an alien imposition on the Taiwan population.
                    But over a period of years it very gradually became “Taiwanized,” and
                    democratization of the political process became really a matter of survival for
                    the KMT. I don't think it grows primarily out of an ideological attachment to
                    Jeffersonian principles, though a lot of policymakers had received educations in
                    the United States or in the West and were certainly familiar with Western
                    notions of democracy. It couldn't have happened in the absence of a pragmatic
                    decision that the KMT had to broaden its appeal and had to democratize in order
                    to maintain power and avoid an explosion. So increasingly Taiwan's system began
                    to look attractive to us. On the other side of the strait, the PRC government
                    not only did not embrace our value system, it explicitly rejected it. Since much
                    of our own national identity is bound up in values that we promote around the
                    world, rejection of those values are difficult for us to tolerate, and that can
                    be a heavy burden for a relationship to bear.</p>
                <p>So after Tiananmen, there was a clear shift in public, congressional and media
                    sentiment away from Beijing and toward Taiwan. This contributed to pressure to
                    ratchet up the official nature of our relationship with Taiwan as much as
                    possible and to reject pressure from Beijing not to do so. This led to a couple
                    of things. One was the so-called Taiwan Policy Review, to which I have already
                    alluded. This was really a misnomer. It wasn't a review of policy so much as a
                    review of how we implement policy. There really wasn't a serious notion that we
                    would change policy, and it was unfortunate that on the Hill, and to some extent
                    in Taiwan, the impression was that we were considering a change in our policy in
                    some fundamental way. That was never in the cards. The actual review, which took
                    quite a long time, preceded my tenure in the office. What happened after I
                    arrived was the rolling out of the review. The results really affected only a
                    few things on the margin, and to this extent were a disappointment in Taiwan and
                    on the Hill. One example was the change in the name of the Taiwan office here,
                    from the awkward and somewhat mystifying “Coordinating Council for North
                    American Affairs.” There was clearly a case for changing the name, and Taiwan
                    would have liked to change it in a way that would make it look as official as
                    possible. Many on the Hill also wanted to make it as official as possible. We
                    wanted to change it in a way that clearly identified the office as
                    representative of Taiwan, but at the same time did not identify it as an
                    official organization. We eventually settled on “Taipei Economic and Cultural
                    Representative Office.” It's still pretty awkward, but at least it provides some
                    clue of what the office is about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm told that, one hears about the Israeli lobby and the
                        Greek lobby, but the Taiwanese lobby in the United States is no small

                </p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>LANGE: We rather thought in our parochial way that Taiwan was second only to
                    Israel in terms of its influence. That may be overstating it, but clearly they
                    are very effective. They've been practicing since the early '40s, when Mme.
                    Chiang Kai-shek was such a hit with the Congress. Many people from Taiwan have
                    been educated in the United States and speak fluent English. They adopt familiar
                    given nameFred, Jimmand that makes it easier for Americans to relate to them.
                    They understand our system. They patiently cultivate the grass roots. For
                    example, using their many branch officethe equivalent of consulatethey obtain
                    friendly resolutions from city councils and the like. In Georgia, they managed
                    to get the state authorities to issue diplomatic plates to their people in
                    Atlanta. The contrast with Beijing, which by and large has been dismissive of
                    such retail diplomacy, could hardly be starker. One of the ironies of the PRC
                    election influence scare, the notion that Beijing was trying to improperly
                    influence our political process, is that the PRC, unlike Taiwan, would hardly
                    have known where to attempt to exert improper influence.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LANGE: That's right. I think what the Chinese ambassador was trying to dto the
                    extent that the press is correct about what we know about meetings in the
                    Chinese embasswas to exhort his people to try and become at least half as
                    effective as their Taiwan counterparts in knowing what was happening on the Hill
                    and trying to be influential. And of course that's what our system is based
                    oinfluence. Although we will probably never know all the facts, I am doubtful
                    that they contemplated directly buying election influence. The Chinese
                    ambassador was at the time under the gun from Beijing, since this was shortly
                    after the shock we administered by allowing Taiwan's president to address a
                    Cornell graduation.</p>

                <p>LANGE: Well, Lee Teng-hui's Cornell visit in 1995 ties directly to your lead-in
                    about influence. Taiwan's influence traditionally was focused particularly on
                    the Hill. Taiwan never felt that the State Department was especially sympathetic
                    to their case, and there's some justification there. The State Department is
                    interested in a rational, logical and consistent policy that clearly serves our
                    interest. I don't want to say that the Hill is not interested in that;
                    congressional postures are generally placed in a national interest framework.
                    But Hill people have other priorities and respond to different things, such as
                    constituent pressure and what plays well in the media. The new dimension that
                    Taiwan, specifically the KMT, developed was working directly through lobbyists,
                    in effect bypassing its own foreign affairs establishment. Its foreign affairs
                    ministry had traditionally been dominated by Mainlanders, and they had a clear
                    understanding of this elaborate system that had been worked out, of the
                    official-unofficial balance and what the traffic would bear in Beijing. They
                    wanted to preserve a setup that fostered stability, which is really in Taiwan's
                    interest. But the first Taiwan-born present, Lee Teng-hui, was much less
                    concerned with any progress toward reunification, or even preserving the status
                    quo, than he was with establishing a separate identity and maximum autonomy for
                    Taiwan. So, against the advice of his foreign affairs establishment, the KMT,
                    through a chum and fellow Cornell grad, Liu Tai-ying, concluded a highly
                    lucrative contract with a lobbying firm in Washington. The KMT had vast business
                    interests, and we reckoned at the time that it was probably the wealthiest
                    political party in the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What lobbying firm was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Cassidy and Associates. We understood that Cassidy's mission was to secure
                    an invitation from Cornell to Lee to address a graduating class, and to get the
                    U.S. Government to permit it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a graduate of Cornell.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>LANGE: Lee is an alumnus of Cornell with a graduate degree in agricultural
                    economics. Cornell was actually ready to issue the invitation at any time, and
                    Cassidy's most important task was to make it happen, knowing that our foreign
                    affairs establishment would see it as an unbalancing act that did not serve our
                    national interests, knowing that it would be interpreted as threatening in
                    Beijing, even as a step toward reestablishment of an official relationship.
                    Cassidy went about this by emphasizing a couple of aspects. One was that this
                    was unofficial. Here's a man, they said, who's an alumnus. Cornell can invite
                    any alumnus to make an address. It was a private matter and had no political
                    significance. All of this was hogwash. Chinese on both sides of the Strait knew
                    that the matter was heavy with political significance. We cautioned members of
                    congress, both in testimony and privately, that it was a highly charged
                    political matter, though some later professed astonishment at the ensuing
                    firestorm and claimed that State had not warned them. The second pitch by
                    Cassidy was that nobody was going to tell the U.S. to whom we could issue a
                    visa. Were we going to let the Red Chinese tell us we could not? So what if
                    Beijing was a bit unhappy? This argument of course resonates in the U.S. body
                    politic. Cassidy encouraged friendly people in Congress to introduce resolutions
                    in both houses in favor of issuing a visa to Lee to go to Cornell. The
                    resolutions passed overwhelminglunanimously in the House and with just one
                    dissenting vote in the Senate. So the administration faced this dilemma knowing
                    this was going to exact a cost in our relationship with Beijing and knowing that
                    there was no clear benefit to our foreign relations to issue this visa, yet
                    facing an overwhelming expression of congressional sentiment.</p>
                <p>I was not a party to any high-level meetings at which decisions were taken but at
                    one point, there was a meeting in then Under Secretary Tarnoff's office with
                    Winston Lord. When we briefed Tarnoff on the state of play, particularly on the
                    Hill, he said, “Well, it looks like the game is over. It looks like we'll have
                    to agree to this visit.” So we did. I presume that Tarnoff had already been in
                    touch with the NSC, and I believe that by the time of the meeting, Pres. Clinton
                    had told Virginia Senator Chuck Robb that we would approve the visit, so there
                    was really nothing left for the State Department to fight about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, maybe I'm just looking at it too much in
                        retrospect, but when you get Congress doing something like this, there's no
                        way, I mean with the American public, you can't say, “Well so-and-so, who's
                        a distinguished alumnus can't go and address his college.” You know, it just
                        isn't the American way. Our fancy dance of trying to do this may play well
                        in the diplomatic circle, but this is one where it was a losing game to
                        start with.</hi>

                <p>LANGE: When you put it in those terms, matching one of our cherished freedomas
                    the NSC in this case came up with at the last minute, “freedom to travel”
                    against fastidious attention to diplomatic fine print, it's no contest. I think
                    the question that was not clearly joined, especially on the Hill, is whether or
                    not it was in our interest to agree to the visit. If we had made a strong case
                    to Cornell not to issue the invitation, they would not have done so, even though
                    they clearly had a right to do so. The Administration could have decided to
                    demonstrate to Beijing that our heart was in the right place by not issuing the
                    visa and forcing Congress, if it had the will, to pass binding legislation
                    rather than a non-binding resolution. But there was never serious consideration
                    of taking such a course, which would have been high risk and a political
                    loser.</p>
                <p>The way in which this unfolded, with the Administration hanging on to established
                    policy until the last minute, then suddenly capitulating, left us in an
                    unfavorable position with respect to what Lee would actually do when he went to
                    Cornell. There was no negotiating process leading up to the visa decision on
                    what he would say. After the decision was conveyed to Taiwan, we didn't dare
                    engage in such a process because we knew that any effort would get immediately
                    back to the Hill. We didn't want to be charged with trying to “muzzle” Lee.
                    Winston Lord has since said, both privately and publicly, that we had an
                    understanding that Lee was going to make a nonpolitical speeca reflection on his
                    years at Cornell. I think that was just wishful thinking on our part. We never
                    had such an understanding with the Taiwan authorities. Our director in Taipei
                    reported speculation that that's the sort of speech Lee might give, but I don't
                    recall that it was speculation rooted in information from Lee's office. I think
                    it's not correct to suggest that Taipei betrayed us, though Winston Lord has
                    taken a different position, and he blamed Taiwan's Washington representative,
                    Benjamin Lu, for not keeping us informed about the speech. The fact is, we had
                    no leverage on speech content, and Benjamin Lu was outside of Taiwan's
                    decision-making loop, considering that the KMT had frozen out Taiwan's foreign
                    ministry in generating pressure for the Cornell event. In any case, I believe
                    that once we decided to issue the visa, that decision became the essential fact.
                    What Lee said was in a sense secondary, and given all the KMT effort and expense
                    that had gone into producing the invitation and the visa approval, it was fairly
                    predictable that the address was not going to be bland and inoffensive to
                    Beijing. It was not in the event an apolitical speech, and it caused a
                    predictable firestorm. The whole episode surprised Beijing, and it raised
                    questions in the PRC about where we were going with Taiwan policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the major points that he was making?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>LANGE: As I suggested earlier, the content of the speech was in my view secondary
                    to the mere fact that he was making it: The first president of Taiwan, with
                    which we have unofficial relations, visiting the U.S. for a high profile event
                    and using that stage to say anything at all on Taiwan's status was going to
                    alarm Beijing. The speech itself wasn't blatantly political, but to those fluent
                    in the code of cross-Strait relations, it was provocative. On both sides of the
                    Taiwan Strait, they pay absolutely excruciating attention to terminology. For
                    example, when Lee referred to the “Republic of China on Taiwan”, that conveyed a
                    certain message to Beijing. The previous formulations had always been “Republic
                    of China,” period. The historical background is so important here. When Chiang
                    Kai-shek lost the civil war and retreated to Taiwan, he always said that he
                    would retake the mainland, reinstall the rightful government of China, and
                    restore the Republic of China. We went along with this fantasy for 30 years,
                    some even maintaining that we should “unleash Chiang”. After Chiang Kai-shek
                    died, his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, became president. Toward the end of his tenure,
                    Chiang the son explicitly dropped the notion that they would reinvade the
                    mainland at some point and reestablish a Republic of China government. But he
                    did not declare a second China located on Taiwan, or an independent Taiwan. Both
                    sides still subscribed to one China policy; that is, that Taiwan is a part of
                    China. Whether the Taiwan side under Lee Teng-hui still adhered to a one China
                    policy was in doubt, and when Lee alluded to the “Republic of China on Taiwan”,
                    it sounded tantamount to a declaration of a second China. But this was not
                    earth-shaking, and what he said was by and large consistent with what he had
                    said on previous occasions, not that Beijing liked hearing them then, either.
                    What was new was that he gained an important political platform. He could have
                    come to Cornell a few years later, when he would no longer be President of
                    Taiwan. But of course he and Cassidy, and for that matter Cornell, weren't
                    interested in that; they wanted to do it while he was president.</p>
                <p>Q: There must have been problems of security, and I take it everybody was taking
                    a very hands-off attitude in the government.</p>
                <p>LANGE: Actually, we did provide security, coordinated by State's Diplomatic
                    Security. AIT did the meet and greet, and coordination with Lee's traveling
                    party. To keep our official profile as low as possible, I sent my deputy to
                    Ithaca. Three members of Congress went up there to make their own publicity on
                    his arrivaJesse Helms, Alphonse D'Amato of New York, and Frank Murkowski of
                    Alaska.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>The political fallout from the Cornell episode was predictable in some respects
                    and unpredictable in others. We knew that it was going to cause complications in
                    our relations with China and with Taiwan. There was a Taiwan domestic politics
                    angle. Lee was at this point president by virtue of an indirect election, but
                    Taiwan's first direct election for president was approaching in March 1996. This
                    could well have been a driving force behind the Cassidy campaign: A U.S. visit
                    would surely lift Lee's electoral prospects. In advance of elections held
                    earlier for Taiwan's legislature, Beijing had conducted military exercises, just
                    to remind Taipei that they were there and that military action was possible if
                    political events got out of hand. Military experts agree that there's no way
                    that Beijing could prevail in a direct military action at this point. The PRC
                    doesn't have the capacity, including especially the amphibious capability, to
                    mount an invasion. But there are other options. They very explicitly reminded
                    Taipei during this period that they could create problems by disrupting
                    shipping, for example. Taiwan is heavily dependent on foreign trade, so
                    disruption of shipping would exact a very significant economic cost from Taiwan.
                    Beijing did this not very subtly by lobbing a few missiles into waters northeast
                    and southwest of Taiwan, near shipping lanes leading to the ports of Keelung in
                    the north and Kaohsiung in the south. It was a crude demonstration that Beijing
                    could put missiles wherever it chose, either threatening shipping or threatening
                    Taiwan itself. So this caused great consternation, particularly on the Hill,
                    though there was no indication that the PRC planned to take the demonstration
                    further, much less threaten an invasion of Taiwan.</p>
                <p>Here, the language of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) comes into play. The TRA
                    provides the fundamental legal framework for our relationship with Taiwan. It
                    sets up the American Institute in Taiwan and lays out various principles
                    governing our relationship. One of the provisions of the TRA is that the
                    President is directed to inform Congress promptly of any threat to the
                    socioeconomic system of the people of Taiwan or any danger to the United States
                    arising therefrom. Well, did these missile demonstrations rise to the level of a
                    threat to Taiwan? We concluded that they didn't; they were not reportable to
                    Congress as a threat because they were a demonstration, not a precursor to an
                    invasion. There were other views in the Congress and some sentiment that we
                    should “do something about it.” Clearly, Beijing was trying to intimidate the
                    voters in Taiwan and convince them not to vote for Lee, this president who had
                    flirted with notions of independence, upset the delicate political balance, and
                    endangered Taiwan security. It didn't work. Lee won the election by a very
                    substantial margin, and there is a possibility that PRC actions may well have
                    helped Lee.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>So what was the proper U.S. response to the missile gambit? It's a difficult
                    question. We had to signal that Taiwan was important to us without saying to
                    Taiwan that we were necessarily and unconditionally going to defend Taiwan if
                    something happened. We've always resisted doing that for the very good reason
                    that people in Taiwan might regard this as an invitation to declare independence
                    or do something otherwise provocative. We have never provided a guarantee of
                    military intervention. Ultimately, the decision that was taken was to convey to
                    both sides the sense that this was an important issue to the U.S. We did this by
                    dispatching two carrier task forces to the area. (I don't know who pushed for
                    two; we at State thought it would be one.) Contrary to what is commonly believed
                    and stated, the carriers and their support ships did not go into the Taiwan
                    Strait, but rather stood off Taiwan on the Pacific side. The Taiwan Strait is
                    international waters, and we do with some regularity send naval vessels through
                    the Strait. In this case, we did not do so for the good reason that it would be
                    seen as needlessly provocative. The message of the task force was that this was
                    an area of great policy importance to us. Beijing wasn't happy with our exercise
                    of gunboat diplomacy, but there wasn't anything it could do. Beijing had in fact
                    terminated the missile exercise before the carrier task forces were dispatched,
                    so the action was purely symbolic, for the benefit of Beijing, for U.S. public
                    opinion and for Taipei, in descending order. We matched the PRC, symbolic
                    gesture for symbolic gesture, and it was sufficient to allay fears in Congress
                    that we were not responding to the crisis. It was reassuring to Taiwan. Not
                    surprisingly, some in Taiwan also took it as a concrete sign that when the chips
                    are down, the U.S. will defend Taiwan militarily. This is the sort of dangerous
                    belief that we have tried to discourage over the years.</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>The Administration was not happy, needless to say, to be faced with this new
                    crisis in U.S.-China relations, or with the way in which Lee's actions had
                    precipitated it. I participated in a meeting meant to convey, directly to Taiwan
                    and at a high level, the message that the Cornell episode was not helpful to
                    U.S.-Taiwan relations or to U.S. efforts to preserve stability in that part of
                    the world. Deputy NSA Berger and Under Secretary Berger met in a New York hotel
                    with Ding Mou-shih, head of Taiwan's National Security Council. Ding had been
                    Taiwan's representative in Washington, spoke fluent English, and we knew him to
                    be very able. We had no illusions that he was part of Lee's inner circle, but we
                    thought that Ding had been careful to establish credibility with Lee, and that
                    as a highly-respected member of Taiwan's foreign affairs establishment, Lee
                    might listen to him. The meeting was arranged with extraordinary secrecy,
                    without either AIT/W or TECRO's knowledge, mainly to shield it from the
                    ever-resourceful Taiwan press. Berger went over U.S. policy and explained the
                    decision to sent the carrier task forces. He gave some emphasis, and he conveyed
                    this in firm tones, to our perception that this cross-Strait confrontation was
                    in significant measure traceable to the Cornell episode, and that it had been in
                    no one's interest, including Taiwan's. He indicated pretty clearly that the
                    Administration would not look kindly on another effort by Taiwan to take
                    unilateral actiosuch as it did on going around the Administration on the Cornell
                    vision something that was so closely linked to U.S. interests. It is hard to
                    know how that message was received in Taipei. Ding gave away nothing at the
                    meeting. Whatever he thought personally about the wisdom of the Cornell gambit,
                    he showed not a hint of doubt. One could conclude from the conversation that
                    Taiwan would continue to make its own judgments on its interests. To this I
                    would add my own interpretation: Whether or not it complicates American foreign
                    relations. It is certain that Taipei will continue to place great store in its
                    relations with members of Congress. Since the KMT has been voted out of power,
                    perhaps it no longer maintains the sort of independent relationship with
                    lobbyists that produced Cornell. Its successor as majority party, the Democratic
                    Progressive Party (DPP), even if it wanted to pursue this sort of back channel
                    foreign relations, does not have the resources to do so. The DPP does, however,
                    keep its lines open to members of Congress. Other groups that openly promote
                    Taiwan independence have long had strong relationships with some members.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see during this time, shortly before, a year or
                        two before, we had the demise of the Soviet Union. Particularly with the
                        right wing of the Republican Party, I've had sort of the feeling that it's
                        been looking around for an enemy, and China has become sort of the
                        designated enemy and continues today. Did you have any feel about that? They
                        were building up an atmosphere that China was gong to be the enemy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>LANGE: It's a question that's being thrashed out today. Entire conferences are
                    organized around the question of whether or not we are demonizing China. Current
                    press articles deal with disagreements within the Republican Party about the
                    appropriate stance toward China, worrying that we can have no confidence about
                    the direction in which China is going to go. There is this notion that people
                    were looking for the next adversary as the Cold War wound down. As David Sanger
                    of the New York Times titled an article: “Looking for an Enemy, and Finding
                    China”. It is useful to recall the self-fulfilling prophecy to which Winston
                    Lord often referred: If we want China as an enemy, we can assure that by
                    treating them as such.</p>
                <p>The fact is that Beijing explicitly rejects many of our notions about governance,
                    for example, or human rights. As a nation, we have a relatively short history,
                    and we are the product of many different social and historical traditions. One
                    thing that ties us together is shared values, and we actively promote those
                    values abroad, much more than other countries do. We are comfortable when others
                    accept those values. Taiwan has bought into this vision, but the PRC has not.
                    Another problem is that large countries have large interests, usually think
                    they're right, and don't like to be told what to do. That's true of
                    Chinliterally, the “Middle Kingdom” and of the U.S.</p>
                <p>Here's an illustration of how our differing perceptions of the PRC and Taiwan can
                    come into play in a concrete way. Taiwan has official relations with some
                    smaller countries in Central America and Africa, often those where Taiwan's aid
                    programs can influence diplomatic recognition. From time to time, Taiwan's
                    political leaders, including the president, want to visit those countries. The
                    only convenient way to get to those in Central America is through the United
                    States, so we've worked out these carefully delimited arrangements for transit.
                    This is strongly opposed by Beijing, which would prefer to keep tightening the
                    noose and completely isolate Taiwan. We've told Beijing that we are nevertheless
                    going to permit transits, for the “comfort and convenience” of the traveler.
                    These transits are not meant to be political events, but not surprisingly,
                    Taiwan usually tries to push the envelope and gain some political mileage of one
                    sort or the other. One of these episodes provided the backdrop for the Cornell
                    visa decision. In 1993, Lee Teng-hui wanted to visit Central America. He wanted
                    to stop in Hawaii and while there touch base with Chinese-American groups. We
                    tried to negotiate an arrangement whereby he could refuel the plane, but rather
                    than contact overseas Chinese, take a rest in the VIP lounge at Hickam AFB. This
                    was consistent with policy but did not meet Lee's expectations. He was so teed
                    off that upon landing, he refused to deplane. It was a master stroke, aided by
                    the press which widely reported that he was not allowed to deplane. Friends of
                    Taiwan were outraged, and were determined that we would never again show such
                    “disrespect” to the president of Taiwan, or “kowtow” to Beijing. The rest, as
                    they say, is history.</p>

                <p>The 2000 Taiwan presidential election resulted in the election of Chen Shui-bian.
                    This is remarkable in itself, because Chen heads the Democratic Progressive
                    Party (DPP), which only 20 years previously was outlawed in Taiwan. The DPP has
                    as an explicit element in its platform calling for independence for Taiwan. To
                    his credit, Chen has soft-pedaled this plank and has tried not to antagonize
                    Beijing. He requested a transit of the U.S. to visit Central America, and my
                    understanding is that his people were quite understanding and did not themselves
                    try to create pressure for political events. Some congressmen were not so
                    cautiouSam Gejdenson, Dana Rohrabacher, a couple of otherwanted to have a
                    meeting with Chen. He said it wasn't convenient. Rohrabacher apparently showed
                    up at the hotel anyway and sort of invited himself to have a meeting with Chen.
                    Now, our congressmen have a right to see a visitor when comes to the U.S. But is
                    the question rights or is it interests? In this case, the Taiwan leadership saw
                    that it was not in their interest to have these meetings, particularly on the
                    first transit. The congressmen had a different agenda and reached a different
                    conclusion. How long Chen sees it in his interest to exercise restraint remains
                    to be seen. His domestic political considerations may persuade him to be more
                    demanding in the future, particularly if he judges that the risk is limited
                    because of a security guarantee from the U.S.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Just last week. In a sense it goes back to your broader question of how we
                    view China. Is it or could it be an adversary? What are its intentions, to the
                    extent that we can determine them? Is it in our interest to promote the
                    international status of Taiwan in the course of one of these transits, even if
                    it complicates our relations with the PRC? From our standpoint, it could be
                    viewed as the “right thing” to do, consistent with spreading our values beyond
                    our borders. Beijing however is likely to view it as a threatening interference
                    in a Chinese affair.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, during this '94-96 period, were we working actively
                        to tell the people on Taiwait's not in your interest to go for declaring
                        independence.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>LANGE: Oh, yes. We tried in many ways to convey that message. It's received in
                    different ways in Taiwan. As I mentioned before, the foreign affairs
                    establishment in Taiwan agreed in principle that declaring an independent Taiwan
                    was not in Taiwan's interest. The issue is that an increasing percentage of the
                    population in Taiwan probably thinks that it should be independent. Taiwan is
                    very prosperous and is now embarked in a new political direction. It doesn't
                    trust Beijing. There are any number of reasons why an independent course appears
                    to be the way to go. What they're apparently recognizing is that although
                    independence may be an ultimate goal, to pursue that now is going to be
                    counterproductive. Actually, the status quo works well for Taiwan. It has in
                    many respects the best of all worlds. It has security, including an arrangement
                    with the United States that helps secure the peace in that area. It is
                    prosperous and is a successful trading economy. What it lacks is international
                    statu“respect”. It doesn't have a seat in the UN, and it doesn't have a seat in
                    various international bodies. So what most Taiwan people want is status quo
                    plus. They don't want to change their security, but they want more than that.
                    And why wouldn't they? Under the U.S. security umbrella, pushing the envelope
                    doesn't carry a high risk.</p>

                        Rosslyn at one point, I can't remember if it was during this time that they
                        appointed a director who was not sort of a China hand, but a political
                        person, and this caused a lot of turmoil?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Oh Lord, yeJim Wood! Personally, this episode represented my least
                    satisfactory contact with our appointments process. It truly was awful. It
                    relates to the corporate nature of AIT, with the chairman in Washington
                    (Rosslyn). This chairman has certain financial responsibilities with respect to
                    running AIT, but no policy role. At the same time there is a director in Taipei
                    who responds to the department like any other chief of mission, but does not
                    answer to Rosslyn on policy. If you look at the corporate documents of AIT, it
                    appears that the Taipei director works for the chairman in Rosslyn. From the
                    beginning, the AIT chairmen were retired Foreign Service personnel. They all
                    understood the origins of this animal and that its viability depended to a large
                    extent on unwritten understandings of how the institution operated. Jim Wood had
                    a White House connection, though I never clearly understood the nature or
                    strength of the connection. He had come from Arkansas years ago and he knew
                    Clinton, but he denied that he was an FOfriend of Bill. Wood had some
                    familiarity with AIT, because he had in the late 1970s worked for the Legal
                    Advisors Office of the State Department. He knew about the corporate legal
                    documents. He made a political case that the chairman should be a Democrat. I
                    saw a document at one point that laid out an argumennot specifically attributed
                    to Wood, but I'm sure it was reporting on his thinkinthat the sitting chairman
                    at that time, Nat Bellochi, a retired foreign service officer, was a Republican
                    appointee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nat, I know is a China hand, had served as an ambassador
                        there. He's a regular Foreign Service Officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>LANGE: Sure! This was utter nonsense! Nat had served in Taiwan and in Hong Kong.
                    He was later ambassador to an African country. Anyway, there was the argument
                    made in the memo that the Democrats should treat this as a political
                    appointment, and due to the black box nature of White House appointments, I
                    could never grab hold of this and put it out on the table and address it. There
                    was in any case heavy-handed pressure from the White House, exercised through
                    Dick Moose, then undersecretary for administration, to make the Wood
                    appointment. I tried to warn Winston Lord that this would be trouble. Later, I
                    was told by others, not Lord, that Lord was pressured to accept Woothat he
                    understood that if he did not sign off on this appointment, he would not get
                    action on a vacant DAS (deputy assistant secretary) position in EAP that he
                    desperately needed to fill. Someone was really playing hardball.</p>
                <p>AIT has a board structure, at that time constituted of three uncompensated,
                    retired and senior State Department officers. They met from time to time to
                    discuss what was going on in AIT, but frankly didn't have a lot to do with
                    running AIT. When it was evident that the Wood appointment was going through,
                    all three of the directors resigned, and one of them did it quite publicly,
                    writing a letter to the Secretary. I spent a great deal of time finding three
                    new board members who would serve in this situation, but you can imagine how
                    reluctant people were to take on this thankless job, as I mentioned
                    uncompensated. I eventually found three willing to sign on. One in particular,
                    Bill Brown, agreed to head the board, and he devoted a great deal of effort to
                    understand the issues and to look for a resolution to this crisis in AIT
                    governance. He was careful to act independently and keep his distance from
                    State, but he helped to keep a lid on things, and we owe a lot to him.</p>
                <p>I had to try to limit the damage of an incoming chairman who not only didn't
                    really understand the system and by all indications was even hostile to the
                    system. I decided to use as one tool the Secretary's letter of appointment to
                    the AIT chairman. Theretofore the letter had been a matter of a page or so and
                    largely non-substantive. With help from the Legal Adviser's Office, I undertook
                    to create a letter that was much more specific, spelling out responsibilities
                    and expectations. It ended up three-and-a-half pages. Moose presented the letter
                    to Wood, who was very unhappy. He didn't like it because it made certain things
                    explicit that he didn't want made explicisuch as that the AIT director in Taipei
                    was subject to policy direction from the Department, not from the AIT chairman.
                    From the outset, the Department had a very strained and unhappy relationship
                    with Wood. He made some really irresponsible charges about fraud and malfeasance
                    within AIT, even selling visas for money and sexual favors. He also allegedly
                    became involved in political fund raisinI don't know if it was improper, but the
                    FBI opened an inquiry. Eventually, because he had created so much bad blood and
                    was so obviously not on the team, Wood was prevailed upon to resign.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be political fundraising?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>LANGE: Yes. When you're dealing with Taiwan, it's a very tempting target,
                    considering its prosperity and its need to maintain political influence in the
                    U.S. Recall that this was during the fund-raising activities of John Huang, and
                    there were some news accounts of cooperation between Wood and Huang. My only
                    direct knowledge of relevant information took place in California. In 1996,
                    after Lee Teng-hui was elected Taiwan president in the first-ever direct
                    election, we needed a delegation to send to the inauguration. The White House
                    eventually decided that the delegation (which represented not the government or
                    the nation, but the “people of the United States”) should be headed by FOB
                    Vernon Jordan, and it included Senator Jay Rockefeller and University of
                    California Berkeley Chancellor Chang-lin Tien. Delegation selection afforded
                    some indirect evidence that Wood was not plugged in to the White House. The day
                    before we learned of Jordan's selection, Wood told me that he thought Jordan
                    would be a “terrible” choice. He soon deemed it a brilliant selection. The
                    delegation flew to San Francisco, there to pick up Chancellor Tien. While we
                    were waiting in a lounge at the airport, Wood began to hold forth on the mistake
                    that Taiwan was committing in overemphasizing its relationship to the Republican
                    Party and ignoring the Democrats. He asserted that Taiwan was contributing
                    directly to Republican campaigns; Rockefeller expressed skepticism. Wood forged
                    ahead, pointing out that the dispatch of the carriers in the recent crisis
                    showed that Taiwan owed much to the Democratic Party and should get its
                    priorities straight. This was a theme that Wood reportedly continued to repeat
                    in Taiwan. Wood delivered this in the presence of Taiwan's San Francisco
                    representative who was there to greet the delegation. He was visibly embarrassed
                    and was mute throughout the conversation. We all thought it was a remarkable
                    performance.</p>
                <p>I don't know where the investigation led, but apparently direct solicitation of
                    contributions was not substantiated. The FBI interviewed me about the San
                    Francisco episode, but I heard nothing more about it. Wood continued to fight
                    after his resignation. He held a couple of press conferences at which he alleged
                    that he was forced to resign because of what he had uncovered about fraud and
                    mismanagement in AIT. I believe that he later brought suit against AIT and
                    Bellochi. I don't know the details, but I think it has been dismissed. The seeds
                    of AIT's accounting problems can be traced back to its creation. It is such a
                    strange creature, and it doesn't easily fit in the Department system. The
                    Department accounting standard that's applied to official overseas missions
                    isn't appropriate to AIT, which has a stand alone budget and a separate
                    congressional appropriation. It also earns a lot of its own money through visa
                    fees. AIT is something that was created out of policy necessity and had not been
                    put on a sound accounting basis. So it did give rise to some doubts about
                    appropriate accounting and what had happened to certain money. Audits found that
                    some funds could not be properly accounted for; Wood converted that into
                    “missing” funds. Wood took it upon himself to hire on behalf of AIT independent
                    auditors, who confirmed that the accounts were in a mess. But Wood spoke
                    irresponsibly of fraud and malfeasance, and in many ways tried to create
                    difficulties. It was a painful and debilitating episode, and it should have
                    never happened. It was entirely a self-inflicted wound.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>There is another significant Taiwan issue, perhaps the most important issue in
                    the triangular U.S.-PRC-Taiwan relationship, that I should mentiomilitary arms
                    sales to Taiwan. At the time we established diplomatic relations with the PRC in
                    1979, the issue of our continued arms sales to Taiwan had by mutual agreement
                    been pushed down the road. But in 1981, alarmed by some statements by Ronald
                    Reagan that seemed to portend a resumption of official relations with Taiwan,
                    Beijing sought to confront and resolve the issue. The PRC understandably regards
                    continued arms sales as interference in its domestic affairs. Of more concrete
                    importance, the PRC believes that arms sales, plus our apparent readiness to
                    support Taiwan in a confrontation with the PRC, enable Taiwan to resist
                    indefinitely engagement in discussions on resolution of Taiwan's status. After
                    intense and difficult negotiations over several months, the result was the
                    August 1982 communiqu� with the PRC, which called on the U.S. to limit arms
                    sales to Taiwan to the levels of “recent years”, with a view to eventual
                    termination of such sales. One can debate whether or not the agreed terms of the
                    communiqu� were realistic, but with the passing years, it became increasingly
                    difficult to reconcile with realities. This was particularly so as the PRC
                    directed its military attention away from its borders, especially the
                    USSR/Russia, and toward Taiwan. This PRC posture can be viewed as threatening,
                    and the Taiwan Relations Act, which legally and politically trumps an executive
                    agreement such as the 1982 communiqu�, requires the U.S. to make available to
                    Taiwan the means for self-defense, i.e., arms sales. Our signature to the 1982
                    agreement was premised on the PRC's policy of seeking a peaceful resolution to
                    the Taiwan issue, and its aggressive military posture calls that policy into
                    question. This affords us an additional rationale for levels of arms sales, and
                    these sales are increasingly difficult to reconcile with the 1982 agreement. We
                    assert that we continue to abide by the agreement, while explaining our
                    increasing levels of sales in terms of inflation, necessary replacement for
                    obsolete and out of production items, and doubts about the PRC's peaceful
                    intentions toward Taiwan.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>Arms sales annually came into sharp focus at the time of scheduled arms sales
                    meetings with Taiwan. These were formal meetings at AIT/W, chaired by DOD, at
                    which Taiwan presented a list of its requests for weapons and weapons systems.
                    Taiwan's request lists grew out of both its military and political needs. The
                    F-16 sale in 1991, for example, worth about $6 billion, was of course militarily
                    important, but it was also a huge political and psychological boost to Taiwan.
                    As weapons systems became more sophisticated, they became more difficult to
                    incorporate into Taiwan's military, but it was important to have a steady flow
                    of approvals to show resolve and U.S. support. Each item on the request list was
                    exhaustively vetted from the standpoint of its military importance to Taiwan and
                    its possible effect on cross-Taiwan Strait stability. Each major system brings
                    in its wake a whole series of contingent questions. How do you outfit the F-16,
                    for example? What kind of avionics do you put in and what sort of missiles do
                    you hang on it? Another difficult question was submarines. It is a perennial on
                    Taiwan's wish list, and is an excellent example of a weapons system that Taiwan
                    desires as much for political as for military reasonfor the message that it
                    would send about U.S. support against Beijing's efforts toward unification. For
                    years, we refused to approve sale of submarines, because our judgment was that
                    they are inherently offensive, not defensive, and that they would be
                    destabilizing. Contrary views on this and other weapons systems were common,
                    including on the Hill. Arms sales issues were intensive and required a great
                    deal of inter-agency work with the Pentagon. One of my two officers in the
                    office spent almost full time on arms sales. Later, when I moved to the China
                    Desk, I was on the receiving end of regular protests by the PRC that our arms
                    sales were in violation of the 1982 Communiqu�.</p>

                        1996?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: In '96, I was asked to be the director of the Office of Chinese and
                    Mongolian Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you did that from '96 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: '98.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was happening then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: A lot. The office manages a difficult relationship, so it's a large and
                    busy desk, consisting of ten officers and three administrative assistants. I
                    knew what I was getting into, and I saw it as my last shot at promotion before I
                    TIC-ed out.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That means “time in class.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: I had one more year to get promoted or be forced to retire. I had two
                    interesting yeara lot of work and long hourbut I didn't get the promotion. That,
                    by the way, is a Chinese malediction: “May you live in interesting times.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the issues that you were dealing with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Well, there's a standard quartet of big issues that we deal with on China.
                    One we spent some time on already, which was Taiwan. The second is human rights.
                    Third is proliferation of weapons and delivery systems. The fourth is trade and
                    all of its various manifestations. While I was there we had a fifth one as well,
                    which was the reversion of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty. So any one of those
                    is a major issue and is time-consuming and - in the classic foreign affairs
                    senstends not to be resolvable; the best you can hope is that issues are
                    manageable. One gets from point A to point B but never comes out the end of the
                    tunnel.</p>
                <p>It might be helpful to briefly describe the foreign affairs bureaucracy as it
                    relates to China. Because of the importance of the relationship, the White House
                    always has an interest. That is particularly true in advance of high-level
                    visits, and one of those was always on the horizon during my tenure on the Desk.
                    The president's national security adviser has a direct interest in teeing up
                    these visits. This means that the NSC takes an active part in all significant
                    policy issues, leaving the Desk to manage the day-to-day relationship and,
                    especially when there was a crunch for briefing papers, to act informally to
                    support the small NSC staff. In 1996, shortly before I took over the Desk, the
                    NSC had tried to establish a high-level dialogue, in part to get above the
                    forest of issues and problems and get into the clear air of high strategy. This
                    led to direct insertion of NSA Tony Lake into the dialogue. The nearest
                    counterpart that could be found on the PRC side was Liu Huaqiu, who was director
                    of the State Council foreign affairs office. Lake's meetings with Liu came at
                    roughly the same time as the Strait missile crisis in 1996, and this had the
                    effect of further reinforcing the NSC's hold on China policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>My experience was that the important policy work was done by a small group
                    composed of the NSC deputy for Asia (Sandy Kristoff during most of my tenure),
                    the NSC China person (Bob Suettinger, then Jeff Bader), the EAP DAS for China
                    (Jeff Bader, then Susan Shirk), and Al Romberg, who had the China portfolio in
                    the State Policy Planning Office. They provided the interface to the seventh
                    floor (the policy level) in State, and to the president's national security
                    adviser at NSC. They also made the trips to China to advance important visits.
                    Significant developments in policy or in public diplomacy came out of that
                    group. State, with its manifold responsibilities and relatively ponderous and
                    multi-layered structure, really played second fiddle to the NSC when it came to
                    China policy. The NSC has a lean bureaucracy, and has the pick of State's China
                    people to staff its effort. Half way through my tenure on the China Desk, Susan
                    Shirk came in from academia to fill the China DAS position at State. I think
                    that it was extremely difficult for her to learn in a short period of time what
                    she needed to know about the Washington environment and at the same time
                    establish a working relationship with this small group that was formulating and
                    packaging our China policy.</p>
                <p>We had an awful lot of high-level visitors in those days in both directions.
                    Chinese president Jiang Zemin visited the U.S. in October 1997, and President
                    Clinton visited China in June 1998. These summits always involve intense
                    preparations, where all aspects of the relationship are examined, with a focus
                    on possible “deliverables” agreements, for example, that can be pushed to
                    completion and lend the visits some substance. In both cases, after the summits
                    we prepared multi-page “fact sheets” on achievements that were catalogues of the
                    broad sweep of the relationship. They covered areas such as weapons
                    non-proliferation, regional stability, peaceful nuclear cooperation, human
                    rights, political and security dialogue, military-to-military relations,
                    promotion of the rule of law in China, cooperation in law enforcement, economic
                    and commercial relations, energy and the environment, and science and
                    technology.</p>
                <p>We had a number of other high level visits as well. The vice president,
                    Secretaries of State Christopher and Albright, and CIA Director Deutsch visited
                    China. We had corresponding visits in this direction by China's foreign minister
                    and its national security advisor. The U.S. president and the Chinese president
                    always meet during the annual APEC meeting. There was also a real spike in
                    congressional visits to Beijing. I think during a six-month period, about 20% of
                    the members of congress visited Beijing, which was much more of a load for the
                    embassy in Beijing than for us, but we had to provide briefings and prepare trip
                    materials and all that. We prepared lots of testimony on the Hill. There were a
                    number of meetings with the Chinese on non-proliferation. The Hong Kong
                    reversion really took a lot of time and effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After all, Hong Kong was between the British and the
                        Chinese. What was our role, other than as an observer?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>LANGE: We asserted ourselves for two related reasons. First is our abiding
                    compulsion to spread our political culture — liberal democracy — wherever
                    possible. Secondly, we have assumed a global role as judge of the state of human
                    rights. Remember that every year we publish well over a thousand pages of text
                    on how think other people in the world are behaving with respect to human
                    rights. We took an interest, almost a proprietary interest, in human rights in
                    Hong Kong. Hong Kong had not drawn much human rights attention during over 140
                    years as a colony of Britain, but it captured our imagination now that it was
                    reverting to the sovereignty of “Red China”. Hong Kong had become a success
                    story, really a poster child of laissez-faire capitalism, a free wheeling
                    environment that capitalism hasn't enjoyed in this country since the days of the
                    robber barons. It exhibited the sort of freedom of expression that one would
                    expect to see in any place that had been absorbed into the British system. With
                    reversion to Chinese sovereignty in the offing, Britain had recently begun to
                    allow limited exercise of the right to vote. The Chinese and British had reached
                    agreement in 1982 about arrangements for reversion. In 1992, Congress passed the
                    Hong Kong Policy Act, which mandates an annual report by the State Department on
                    how well China carries out this agreement with the British, with particular
                    attention to Hong Kong's autonomy, specified in the 1982 Sino-British agreement
                    in very broad areas. Hong Kong is to maintain its own customs territory, which
                    means it has its own trade laws. It handles its own immigration and issues its
                    own passport. In any number of lesser ways, it does maintain a separate
                    identity. A process is specified by which Hong Kong people will progressively
                    exercise more direct say through the vote in the selection of a legislative
                    council and a Hong Kong chief executive. The process is deliberate, too slow for
                    some in the U.S. and some in opposition parties in Hong Kong. There were also
                    doubts about the democratic credentials of the first chief executive, who was a
                    business tycoon. He was Beijing's pick, and this rankled among those who thought
                    Hong Kong should be as independent as possible. My view is that in the real
                    world, it made sense in those early, uncertain days that whoever was chief
                    executive in Hong Kong, where China exercises sovereignty, should have a good
                    relationship with Beijing. Otherwise it wasn't going to work.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>Given its iconographic status, there was a great deal of attention in this
                    country to Hong Kong. There was pressure from some quarters on the Hill that the
                    United States should declare that Beijing was in breach of the terms of the '82
                    agreement with the Brits, even though the party directly involved, Britain, was
                    not going to take that step. We decided not to involve ourselves in that
                    question, I think wisely so. Considering all of the doubts that the PRC organism
                    would be able to tolerate the introduction of Hong Kong into its system, or that
                    Beijing might smother the goose that was laying golden eggs, the reversion went
                    pretty smoothly. The PRC handled it carefully. For the reversion ceremony in
                    June 1997, Madeline Albright went to represent the United States. The Chinese
                    army had sent a token garrison, but they stayed in their barracks at the time,
                    and I believe there continues to be little outward sign of a Chinese military
                    presence there. Hong Kong had considerable economic difficulty growing out of
                    the 1998 Asian financial crisis, but had a period of recovery from that and
                    generally speaking has done pretty well financially and politically, much better
                    than I think critics had anticipated. The long term is another question. As
                    other Chinese coastal cities, notably Shanghai, become economic powerhouses,
                    they could become effective competitors. Hong Kong's boom years may not
                    return.</p>
                <p>Politically, there are certain areas where Beijing is extremely sensitive and
                    where the authorities in Hong Kong are going to respect that sensitivity.
                    Advocacy of Taiwan or Tibet independence, for example, will continue to be
                    neuralgic activities in Hong Kong. But Hong Kong these days is much lower on the
                    radar screen than it was during those years leading up to reversion to
                    China.</p>
                <p>The reversion of Macao from Portuguese colonial rule to Chinese sovereignty at
                    the end of 1999 occasioned much less attention from us. It has a much smaller
                    population than Hong Kong and is not very significant economically. Also, the
                    Portuguese have made less pretense of democratic process in their colonies than
                    the British have, so it presented a less compelling object of human rights
                    concern.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>There is a broader significance to Hong Kong. In the early days of the reversion,
                    Taiwan was at pains to point out that Beijing's policy of “one country, two
                    systems”, as applied to Hong Kong, is not a model for Taiwan, and that's quite
                    true. However, Hong Kong is a test for how well Beijing can handle incorporation
                    of a radically different system. Can it manage to keep its hands off? Can it
                    show tolerance of an entity that is much different than anything else on the
                    mainland? In general, can it show that it is able to deal in a flexible way with
                    something that it claims is part of China and in that way begin to develop the
                    sort of trust that is necessary to work out similar, perhaps even more flexible
                    arrangements with Taiwan? On the face of it what Beijing offers Taiwan seems not
                    all that bad. The Beijing leadership has said Taiwan can maintain its own
                    military, keep its own flamany features of separateness, but without
                    sovereignty. Maybe Beijing would even be willing to work out arrangements for
                    Taiwan participation in international organizations, but that seems a distant
                    hope for now. As I have earlier indicated, both sides look at international
                    organization as a zero-sum game. There is no sign of an emerging will to
                    compromise.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Tibet during this '96-98 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Tibet has captured the imagination of the West, particularly Hollywood.
                    Orville Schell, China scholar and Dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at
                    Berkeley, wrote a nice book on the subject: “Virtual Tibet: The Search for
                    Shangri-la from the Himalayas to Hollywood.” I'm sure you're familiar with the
                    current situation. China occupied Tibet in 1950. In '58, the Dalai Lama escaped
                    to India and has been in northern India ever since with a large number of his
                    followers and a government in exile. He also has the stature of a Nobel Peace
                    Prize winner and is a legitimate and compelling religious figure. There's
                    widespread sentiment in the West that Tibet deserves to be an independent
                    country and a sense that Tibetan culture is being compromised, not only as a
                    result of explicit Beijing policy but because of settlement in Tibet by large

                    the Tibetans have good relationships on the Hill. In many respects Americans

                <p>LANGE: Yes, Lost Horizon, in 1933. It was, by the way, the first paper-back book
                    ever published. Shangri-la is an other worldly place, a utopia. People are kind
                    to one another, and life is reflective and rewarding. During the time that I was
                    on the desk, there was an initiative on the Hill to pass legislation mandating a
                    special envoy for Tibet. Now the title “special envoy” conveys a certain
                    officiality. It implies in some sense a recognition that Tibet deserves
                    independence. It was something that, in the judgment of the Department, was not
                    wise and would not promote resolution of the Tibet problem. So in due course,
                    the Department in order to preempt such legislation decided to appoint a
                    “special representative” for Tibet. The person selected for this position was
                    Greg Craig, who at that time was director of Policy Planning. This was years
                    before Elian Gonzales episode, when Craig received much wider public exposure.
                    The rationale was that China and the United States had any number of reasons for
                    Greg Craig to interact with his counterparts in China. We had strategic
                    interests in common that we had a mutual interest in discussing, and therefore,
                    the thinking went, the Chinese would be encouraged to deal with Craig and this
                    might promote his acceptability to them as a Special Representative for Tibetan
                    Affairs. It didn't exactly work out that way. The Chinese were very hardheaded
                    about it. To the extent that they dealt with Craig, they attempted to ensure
                    that he would not try to discuss Tibet with them because in their view there was
                    nothing to discuss. It was better than legislation mandating a special envoy,
                    but it didn't really advance our interest in promoting dialogue between Beijing
                    and the Dalai Lama.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about weapons proliferation? What were the Chinese

                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>LANGE: There are a couple of different aspects to this. One is that Chinese firms
                    or entities were engaged in shipping bad stuff to bad people without the
                    explicit authorization and perhaps even without the knowledge of the central
                    government. The other aspect is the extent to which they knowingly assist
                    countries that in our view should not be assisted. That typically applies to
                    Pakistan, both in the nuclear area and in delivery vehicles; i.e., missiles and
                    missile technology. This gets to be very technical, and I personally did not
                    participate in proliferation discussions with the Chinese. The question can
                    turn, for example, on the very specific provisions of the Missile Technology
                    Control Regime our understanding of what they mean and the Chinese understanding
                    of what they mean. Clearly they skated on the edge with respect to Pakistan. On
                    the other hand, they cooperated with respect to Iran, to which they were sending
                    cruise missiles and where they took steps to end that relationship. This was not
                    easy for China, in terms of its relationship to Iran. It also clearly had a more
                    benign view of Iran than we did. The overall picture is a mixed one - some
                    successes, some areas where we still have a lot of work to do, and a very
                    difficult dialogue. Here is where you come up against Chinese pride, and their
                    sense they're being subjected to standards that we don't subject ourselves to.
                    We identify the bad countries in the world and expect others to agree with us,
                    that sort of thing. It's a very, very tough sell. The other complication is
                    Taiwan. The opening Chinese response in any discussion of proliferation is
                    Taiwan. They always try to leverage our interest in other areas into concessions
                    on arms sales to Taiwan. They would not even accept this
                    characterizatio“concessions”. In their view, they are calling on us to meet our
                    commitments under the 1982 communiqu� on arms sales to Taiwan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now their motivation, irrespective of the Taiwan thing, to
                        Iran, Pakistan and all, would you say that their interest was projection of
                        power or was this commercial?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANGE: It was a combination. It's actually quite similar to our own situation:
                    Commercial interests find the arms trade lucrative; they sell arms to make a
                    profit. Many Chinese parastatal organizations with arms to sell are on a
                    commercial basis. Their prosperity depends on the bottom line, much like Boeing
                    or Lockheed Martin. Governments permit arms sales if they are consistent with
                    their efforts to exert geopolitical influence. In the case of Pakistan, there's
                    a long historical relationship dating back to China's confrontation with India
                    in the 1950s. In the case of Iran or other countries in the Middle East, it's
                    interests similar to our owsecuring relationships in the region that are going
                    to be longstanding and help them secure sources of petroleum. We've demonstrated
                    that we're prepared to go to war over oil, and we'll almost certainly do so
                    again in the future, so it's not surprising that China is prepared to develop
                    arms sales relationships toward the same end. China also has an interest in
                    relationships with the Muslim World that might help to counterbalance Muslim
                    separatist efforts in China's Far West.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LANGE: Beijing? It's not good. They are backward, and the investigation into the
                    '96 fundraising probably set them back even further. They still have a feeling
                    that they don't quite understand the rules, and they have a clear sense that a
                    different standard is applied to them. This is particularly the case now that
                    Taiwan has drawn closer to our own political value system. There's a certain
                    maladroitness in the way the PRC reps present their case. Sometimes it's even a
                    failure to present their case. I've heard staffers on the Hill, even sympathetic
                    staffers, tell me - “We haven't heard from these guys.” They lack confidence.
                    They lack fluency in the language of the Hill. They feel constrained in a way
                    that people from Taiwan don't. They always hew very tightly to policy lines, and
                    this often comes off as strident and uncompromising. They're just not very good

                    do this, you're not going to get very far within the Washington scene. You want
                    to be able to have the ambassador sit down and be able to lunch with a couple of
                    staffers on an important committee or something like that. They can't respond to

                <p>LANGE: The current Chinese ambassador, Li Zhaoxing, came up through the
                    interpreter ranks, not unusual in the Chinese system, and his English is very
                    good. On a one-to-one basis, he can be quite charming. But in his public
                    appearances, he often sounds as though he's reading from his instructions and
                    speaking for Beijing ears. One of the reasons the previous ambassador who was
                    here in '95 took a real hit was failure to understand Washington, and to foresee
                    the Lee Teng-hui visa decision. It was a glaring example of their inability to
                    read us inscrutable Americans. A few weeks prior to our decision that Taiwan's
                    president could come to Cornell, there was a meeting in New York between Chinese
                    Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Secretary Christopher. Naturally, Qian asked
                    about all of the media stories about pressure to issue Lee a visa. Christopher's
                    response was that it's the Administration's policy that we will not agree to
                    this visit but, he went on (I paraphrase), “you have to understand that there is
                    terrific pressure on Capitol Hill. The two houses just passed two resolutions
                    virtually unanimously.” As we read the account of the meeting, we thought to a
                    person that Christopher was trying to convey the real situation. To us, the true
                    meaning of his words was that, “This is the policy today, but tomorrow it could
                    change; you'd better alert Beijing that things could change.” It went right over
                    their heads; the Chinese didn't understand it at all. They undoubtedly reported
                    back to Beijing that they had a fresh, firm assurance from Secretary Christopher
                    that Administration policy is that there won't be a visit by Lee. They truly
                    didn't understand. At the working level, we couldn't give them a clear heads up.
                    Policy is policy, until leadership decides it is no longer policy. The Chinese
                    really felt that they had been badly misled. The Chinese ambassador had to go
                    back to Beijing, and he was still bleeding when he returned to Washington. I
                    think any ambassador here now must feel like he has to be extremely aggressive
                    in pressing Beijing's agenda.</p>

                <p>LANGE: It wasn't long after this that a great brouhaha arose over alleged Chinese
                    attempts to improperly influence our political process, and the ensuing campaign
                    finance investigation. I thought from the time of the first media story, which
                    was based on leaked intercepts, that the information was ambiguous and after
                    storm and fury would still not lead to a clear conclusion on the facts. That was
                    in fact the outcome, but the episode was an invitation to those inclined to
                    “demonize” China in any event to put the worst face on the evidence, such as it
                    was. The irony is inescapable: Lee Teng-hui to Cornell happened in part because
                    the PRC hadn't a clue how to influence or even interpret American political
                    events. When they tried to beef up their ability to play the game, even though
                    that effort may have even been legitimate, that also blew up in their face.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>Even had the Chinese been knowledgeable and able in the ways of Washington, I'm
                    not sure how much they could have done, given an atmosphere approaching
                    hysteria. Scandal piled on scandal, invariably hyped by partisan politics. There
                    were the campaign finance and political influence investigations on John Huang,
                    Maria Hsia, Johnny Chung and Charlie Trie (Chinagate, Donorgate). I think that
                    all of these people were essentially influence peddlers, not sinister agents.
                    Congressional investigations and hearings, headed by Fred Thompson on the Senate
                    side and Dan Burton on the House side, churned the water furiously but in the
                    end came up with no persuasive evidence, in spite of illegal campaign finance
                    activity, to support wild allegations that the Chinese had affected elections.
                    Then there were national security issues raised over involvement in trade of
                    companies controlled by Chinese military units, allegations of assistance to
                    Chinese missile design by U.S. companies Hughes and Loral, and a story that Wen
                    Ho Lee had obtained nuclear secrets from the Los Alamos labs. There were even
                    notions that acquisition by a Hong Kong company, Hutchison Whampoa, of port
                    facilities at either end of the Panama Canal constituted a potential security
                    threat. A select committee headed by California congressman Chris Cox examined
                    all these issues. The Cox Committee findings were dispiriting, not because of
                    the findings per se, which could have been anticipated, but because they were
                    the antithesis of careful and objective inquiry. The report reached dark and
                    categorical conclusions about China's spying activities in the U.S., which
                    rested however on poor analysis and on worst-case assumptions with respect to
                    every ambiguous piece of information. Academics and others discredited the
                    committee's work, but the damage had been done. Well, perhaps this overview
                    serves to give some sense of the noxious climate in which we were trying to
                    conduct relations with China.</p>

                <p>LANGE: That's when I retired. Before we retire from this, though, I mentioned at
                    the outset four big issues that occupied us from '96 to '98. We haven't devoted

                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>Human rights occupied one desk person full time, and it suffused nearly all
                    activities on the desk. At any one time, we were likely to be actively engaged
                    with one or more specific cases, e.g., Harry Wu and prison labor, detention of
                    religious figures in China, suppression of speech, high profile political
                    prisoners, the Falun Gong issue, alleged traffic in human organs. There was
                    always something. It was always a component of high-level meetings. We tried to
                    engage the Chinese, and we tried to exert pressure. Production of the human
                    rights report on China was an annual ordeal. Where did the emphasis belong? Was
                    it on the historical context, in which the experience of the typical Chinese
                    looked quite favorable, or on a universal standard, against which many human
                    rights practices fell short? Typically, those who produced the draft in our
                    embassy were impressed by improvements and the unprecedented enjoyment of human
                    rights in some areas, while the Washington human rights bureaucracy looked
                    through the prism of the human rights professionals, including the
                    non-government organizations. Three-way drafting battles shifted back and forth
                    among the embassy, the desk, and the human rights bureau (DRL). Sometimes,
                    specific issues got to the assistant secretary level. It seemed that no entry
                    could be dropped in subsequent years. The report got longer and longer and the
                    process more excruciating.</p>
                <p>After my retirement, I went to annual meetings in Geneva of the UN Commission on
                    Human Rights to help push for a resolution addressing human rights in China. We
                    had tried for several years to pass such a resolution but had come close only
                    once, in 1995. China assigned a high priority to defeating the resolution and
                    used a combination of enticement and threat on the other delegations, many of
                    which recognized that they themselves could one day be the subject of a
                    country-specific resolution. China argued that a confrontational resolution was
                    not the way to influence human rights behavior and that, regardless of who
                    joined us as cosponsors, the U.S. was trying to impose its human rights
                    standards on others. Every year, a majority of commission members, whatever
                    their views of human rights in China, decided that it was not in their interest
                    to vote for a China resolution. Some human rights advocates argued strongly that
                    the act of presenting such a resolution had a beneficial effect on human rights
                    in China, but after a decade of unsuccessful campaigns, even some non-government
                    organization NGO reps at the Geneva meeting told me that losing efforts were
                    becoming counterproductive.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>Our bilateral efforts to deal with human rights met with mixed success. Between
                    1996 and '98, our bilateral “human rights dialogue” was on hold, in part because
                    of a controversial meeting in earlier years that State's assistant secretary for
                    democracy and human rights, John Shattuck, had set up with a dissident during a
                    visit to Beijing. We made some headway on separate human rights initiativethe
                    beginnings of a program to promote rule of law in China, obtaining agreement for
                    a visit by a delegation looking into religious freedobut progress was fitful.
                    One tempting initiative, particularly in advance of high-level visits, was to
                    secure the release of high-profile political prisoners. Many of us were
                    skeptical about the wisdom of submitting lists of such prisoners to the Chinese,
                    since they could always present any releases as gestures of good faith, with
                    little or no significance to the larger human rights picture. Moreover, the
                    releases were always on “medical” grounds, for treatment outside prison but with
                    the understanding that treatment would be sought abroad; the prisoners were
                    subject to reincarceration if they attempted to return to China. The Chinese
                    thus skirted the potential problem of releasing these dissidents back into
                    Chinese society. We managed to get Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng out in this way.
                    The case of Wei Jingsheng is instructive. He had captured the imagination of the
                    West, because of his personal courage and implacable challenge to the Chinese
                    authorities. He was the dissident with whom John Shattuck had met earlier. But
                    he was largely a solitary figure, not high educatewhich counts for much in the
                    Chinese contexand he did not have strong connections to the expatriate Chinese
                    dissident community. He has not learned English. He has a research position, I
                    think at Harvard, but he has not been able to establish a life for himself
                    outside that of a sort of professional Chinese dissident. By releasing him,
                    China rid itself of an irritant in the U.S.-China relationship at little
                    cost.</p>
                <p>What makes human rights such a difficult issue between us? For some Americans,
                    China is a highly visible outlier in an international human rights structure.
                    Other Americans are committed to a particular aspect of human rights; e.g.,
                    religious freedom, and China has long been a target of Christian missionary
                    effort. At root, I think, is the sense that Chinese human rights practices
                    represent American failure to promote our values and institutionan explicit
                    rejection of what George Kennan, for example, has identified as our messianic
                    notion about U.S. responsibilities in carrying out its foreign relations. In a
                    related way, large numbers of Americans regard promotion of human rights in
                    China as a tool to weaken the hold of an ideology that is corrupt and against
                    which we were pitted during half a century of Cold War.</p>

                <p>The Chinese authorities view our emphasis on human rights as an element of a
                    long-term policy to change their system. On the most obvious level, certain
                    manifestations of human rights, such as freedom of speech or assembly, could
                    turn into threats to the control of the Communist Party of China, and
                    self-preservation dictates resistance. But there is a more broadly Chinese
                    factor at work, a Chinese aversion to luan, or disorder, and a substantial
                    emphasis on collective rights. For traditional Chinese, Western emphasis on
                    individual rights comes across as self-indulgent and, well, foreign. Resentment
                    of foreign efforts to impose change has a long history, predating the Opium Wars
                    of the 1840s. For all of these reasons, I think that we are well served to be
                    patient, and to allow indirect influencethe Internet, growing prosperity,
                    interaction of trade and foreign investment, and student exchangto induce change
                    from within. Unfortunately, our system favors results in four-year cycles. When
                    administrations argue that contact and engagement would bring beneficial change
                    to China, and administrations uniformly make such arguments, they are within two
                    or three years called upon to explain why change has not yet manifested itself.
                    Patience is not one of our virtues.</p>
                <p>Trade seems likely to cause friction for the indefinite future. China has a
                    nearly inexhaustible supply of cheap labor and a rapidly improving technological
                    base. We have a seemingly unlimited appetite for finished goods and the ability
                    to buy them, at least as long as other countries are willing to finance our
                    consumption by buying our debt. That adds up to a chronic and growing trade
                    deficit for us, and to pain for specific sectors such as textiles. It may be
                    true, as economists believe, that bilateral deficits don't matter; but as long
                    as the overall balance is in chronic deficit, huge bilateral deficits are
                    difficult to defend at the political level. From time to time, there have been
                    efforts, legislative or otherwise, to deal with particular pieces of the trade
                    problem on a bilateral basis. Hopefully, with China's accession to the World
                    Trade Organization, we will be able to manage some of the trade issues on an
                    international basis.</p>

                <p>China trade and human rights issues met, until China joined the World Trade
                    Organization in 2001, in the annual ritual of most-favored nation (MFN)
                    hearings. The Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the U.S. Trade Act required a
                    certification that communist countries such as China were not hindering
                    emigration. This was a hangover from the period when the Soviet Union was
                    preventing Jews from emigrating to Israel, but notwithstanding the language of
                    the law, it had mutated over the years into a broad examination of human rights
                    practices in communist countries. The congressional and editorial debates on the
                    pros and cons of MFN for Chinwhether extending it or withholding it was more
                    likely to bring about positive change in Chinwere repeated year after year. The
                    annual renewal effort engaged all of the economic agencies for months and
                    generated reams of congressional testimony. The outcome was always the
                    samrenewal of MFN for Chinbut only after exhaustive and extravagant application
                    of bureaucratic and political capital, from the White House on down. The
                    exercise became part of the landscape, and many in the media and on the Hill
                    regarded it as an opportunity to get in their licks on China. As one member of
                    Congress said, it had become a habit. Perhaps one can understand Deng Xiaoping's
                    confusion about the source of this annual uproar and, upon being informed that
                    the U.S. law in question called for freedom of emigration, his bemusement. He
                    suggested that China would be willing to part with a million or so Chinese
                    emigrants if the U.S. would take them.</p>
                <p>U.S.-China relations have been characterized by wide swings of the pendulum.
                    During my first involvement, 1980-85, there was great optimism, even euphoria,
                    about the future of the relationship. During my second involvement, 1994-98
                    (including my period as Taiwan coordination advisor), we seemed to lurch from
                    crisis to crisis, and to be continually called upon to justify a
                    non-confrontational relationship with China. Even a neutral characterization of
                    the relationship is hard to find. The last-minute product, in connection with
                    preparations for the 1998 Clinton visit to China, was that the U.S. and China
                    were “...working toward a constructive partnership.” The media truncated this
                    for public consumption, dropping the “working toward” element, and making it
                    appear that the Administration was overselling the relationship, or naive, or
                    perhaps both.</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>I would like to be hopeful that we can smooth out the ups and downs of U.S.-China
                    relations, but I am actually not very sanguine. We do have some interests in
                    common. One of these is an interest in stability, which argues for common cause
                    in places like the Korean Peninsula, for economic and trade growth, against
                    regional terrorism, and against proliferation of WMD, even though we may differ
                    on the particular elements of controlling proliferation. On the other hand,
                    China is clearly a rising power, one that will become increasingly important in
                    the region, while we are committed to asserting our interests in the region,
                    including through forward deployment of military forces. On both sides,
                    nationalist sentiments run high. On Taiwan, it is difficult to anticipate
                    resolution of our differences, and there are clearly forces acting to exacerbate
                    those differences. Most fundamentally, China seems unlikely under the current
                    order to embrace our notions of governance and social interaction. Even a new
                    Chinese order, which would probably not come about without a period of disorder
                    or even chaos, might fall short of our ideal of a liberal democracy.</p>
                <p>A constructive relationship is clearly in the mutual interest of the U.S. and
                    China. Given the forces continually heating and cooling these two bodies, it
                    falls to the State Department to anticipate and modulate sudden shocks, and to
                    keep the relationship on track.</p>
