                <p>Q: Today is the 3rd of August, 1999. This is an interview with John A. Buche, and
                    this is being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and
                    Training, and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. John, let's start at the beginning.
                    Can you tell me when and were you were born and something about your family?</p>
                <p>BUCHE: I was born in Richmond, Indiana, on January 13, 1935. I was the first of
                    five children. My father was at the time working for a wholesale food company, a
                    locally owned company. He attended Earlham College for two or three years and
                    then dropped out. My mother had graduated from Earlham. I was raised in
                    Indiana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Earlham is what sort of a school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: It is a Quaker school. It is a liberal arts school, probably never went
                    beyond 3,000 students. My grandparents on my mother's side were both graduates
                    of Earlham, and my grandfather, Rufus Allen, was chairman of the board for many
                    years at Earlham. After I finished grade school in Richmond, I went off to study
                    for the Catholic priesthood at Saint Meinrad Seminary, in southern Indiana. I
                    stayed there for about six years, and after deciding I did not want to become a
                    priest, I left and entered Purdue University. I graduated in 1957, with a
                    Bachelor of Science degree (summa cum laude) and was immediately drafted into
                    the U.S. Army.</p>
                <p>Q: I'd like to go back just a bit. Where were you?</p>
                <p>BUCHE: I was in St. Andrew's School in Richmond. It was a Catholic parish school,
                    taught by the Franciscan nuns of Oldenburg, Indiana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I was wondering, we try to grab some social history
                        whilwe're at it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Fine. I was focusing on what I did later.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Q: I know, but I feel that I would be delinquent if I didn't, as our cadre comes
                    from quite diverse backgrounds. What was your impression of going to a Catholic
                    school run by nuns? This would be in the 1940s.</p>
                <p>BUCHE: That is correct. I had nothing to compare it with. If I had not gone to
                    St. Andrew's Catholic School, I would have gone to public schools. My friends
                    who were not Catholic went to those schools. We competed in basketball, school
                    to school, and then during the summer, we competed one neighborhood against
                    another neighborhood in baseball. Richmond was a typical small Midwestern town
                    of about 35,000. What I remember of Richmond is that school was enjoyable. I
                    always did like school. I also enjoyed the vacation times because we went on
                    small excursions around Richmond, fishing and sometimes picnicking. But I was
                    looking for other things - not that I really disliked Richmond, but I was eager
                    to see what the rest of the United States had to offer. That may have been
                    subconsciously an attraction for going to Saint Meinrad. I am pretty sure at the
                    time, at the age of thirteen or fourteen, I really wanted to become a priest. I
                    was a devout, serious kid, and also one of the best students in the grade
                    school. I think those qualities brought me to the attention of the assistant
                    pastor, who then encouraged me to think about the priesthood. Since I had an
                    uncle who was a priest and an older cousin who was studying at St. Meinrad to be
                    a priest, I thought it would be interesting to follow their example. I could
                    thus get away from Richmond and live in a boarding school. Also, in our
                    small-town family and parish circles, there was some prestige in being a
                    seminarian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was this located?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: It is in the town of Saint Meinrad, Indiana, in southern Indiana, close to
                    Jasper, Tell City, and Ferdinand. It is twenty miles north of the Ohio River,
                    and if you keep going north you will hit Indianapolis. The institution was run
                    by Benedictine monks and comprised a high school, college, and school of
                    theology, plus the monastery for the monks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like you get away from Richmond, but it doesn't
                        sounlike you're getting away to the big city.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>BUCHE: No, it certainly was not the big city, but I heard it was a place where
                    some good minds went and also where there was an active intramural sports
                    program and that I would like it. And I really did. I found life as a seminarian
                    at St. Meinrad to be everything I had hoped for. The academic standards were
                    demanding, but I was always at the top of my class. The religious life was quite
                    different from what I had experienced in Richmond, but I assimilated the
                    discipline and instruction and earnestly sought to advance my spiritual
                    development. Participation in athletics was mandatory, and that suited me well,
                    since I was a good athlete. While I was quite happy as a young seminarian for
                    the first four or five years, it was becoming apparent to me when I went home at
                    Christmastime and during the summers, that there were other attractions in the
                    world beyond St. Meinrad. While the priesthood was my goal as a young teenager,
                    once I approached twenty, I saw more interesting options for my life. I decided
                    in my second year of college at St. Meinrad to give up the goal of becoming a
                    priest and to go to Purdue University to study for a secular career. (My family
                    had moved from Richmond to West Lafayette, Indiana in 1954.) I was attracted to
                    women and found the idea of a celibate life as a priest more and more
                    unappealing. I had no girlfriend at the time, of course, since it was forbidden
                    to date or even think about dating. The monks of St. Meinrad strongly encouraged
                    us to work during our summer vacations at jobs where there would not be women
                    present. Factory jobs or construction work were considered ideal. I worked two
                    summers in a factory, one summer on a highway survey crew, and one summer on the
                    New York Central Railroad as a track repairman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, a gandy-dancer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: I was a gandy-dancer, believe it or not, and I could keep up with the
                    others in hammering the spikes into the ties after about four or five weeks of
                    on-the-job training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's quite an art.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: It is; it requires rhythm. I found out that to be an effective member of
                    the four-man team, I should not hit the spike with full strength, since we
                    worked an eight-hour day, and there was not much shade around. We had to pace
                    ourselves and keep the rhythm. The four men on the team rotate every quarter
                    hour. Two men pound the spikes, and the other two do what is called “nipping”.
                    One person uses a crowbar to raise the wooden tie up a few inches and the other
                    tamps gravel with a shovel in underneath the tie.</p>
                <p>Q: This is quite an art. In the old days, one could say “a gandy-dancer,” and
                    everyone would know what it means, but this is an unfamiliar term to many people
                    today. There was a song about the gandy-dancer.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>BUCHE: Oh, there must have been a lot of songs about them. We certainly did not
                    sing any on the job. It was too hot, and the work so strenuous that we needed
                    all our energy to get through the day. I did not like the work, but it was very
                    well paying. When I returned to school and the monks learned where I had worked
                    for the summer, they told me I had the ideal job for a seminarian - hard manual
                    labor, exclusively with men. I said there were other aspects of working with
                    gandy-dancers which were not so positive. They were at the bottom of the working
                    class, and in most cases were men who had problems holding other jobs. Their
                    language was filled with profanity, and the stories they told about their women,
                    their drinking and fighting, their encounters with the law, and other aspects of
                    their life were not what the good monks had in mind for a young seminarian to
                    hear.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, I would think that you would have felt rather constrained at a certain
                    point. How much theology were you hit with at Saint Meinrad? Did you also have
                    classes in English, history, and the other usual subjects?</p>
                <p>BUCHE: This was the thing that surprised me more than anything else. We had
                    morning mass and evening prayers, and some devotional reading, but it was a very
                    heavy academic schedule of liberal arts subjects such as math, history, science,
                    English, Latin, and Greek. It was an old-fashion classical school, and the
                    monks' approach was “to form the mind” during the high school and the first two
                    years of college. This was known as the minor seminary. The next two years of
                    college and the four years of theology made up the major seminary, where the
                    emphasis was on studies and spiritual formation directly relating to the
                    priesthood. The idea was that a student had to have a broadly based education to
                    be able to understand the philosophy and theology concentration of the major
                    seminary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where would you say the faculty, the priests, and nuns,
                        werfrom?-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: There were no nuns. The only women we ever saw at St. Meinrad were the
                    families of the students who came to visit. The faculty was entirely male, and
                    they were all Benedictine monks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: All Benedictines. Q: Benedictines. Where were they from?</p>
                <p>BUCHE: They came in 1849 from Einsiedeln in Switzerland. Their mother abbey is
                    near Z�rich. There is still a very close relationship between the two
                    abbeys.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you weren't hit with what became the predominant strain
                        in thUnited States, which was a sort of Irish Catholicism.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: No, this was Swiss-German, and it was very much of that culture. Most of
                    the monks were of German background, but were born in the United States. I
                    entered St. Meinrad in 1949, and there were still a few monks who had come over
                    before World War II from the mother abbey. Where St. Meinrad is located is an
                    area in the U.S., where there was a heavy immigration from southern Germany and
                    where the older people still spoke German among themselves. The area was
                    predominantly Catholic. German was, of course, the preferred modern language for
                    the students to study. There were a dozen or so in my class who spoke German in
                    varying degrees at home. The school did make a concession and offered French,
                    but we were encouraged to choose German. There was no Spanish taught. There was
                    a very disciplined Germanic approach in the school, not just to religion and
                    theology, but to everyday living. Our day was modeled to a certain extent on the
                    monastery. One got up at 5:25 A.M. for mass on weekdays, and at 5:55 A.M. on
                    Sundays. After mass, we had breakfast together and went to our various classes
                    from Monday through Saturday. We ate lunch and dinner together. During one meal
                    each day we remained silent and listened to a reading from scripture or from a
                    spiritual work. The Prefects made sure that our table manners were correct, that
                    we were properly groomed, that our cassock (the long, black robe we wore) was
                    clean and our shoes shined. Almost every activity was programmed, and bells
                    would ring to announce the commencement or termination. We studied together in
                    large halls, and at the end of the day, a bell would announce that it was time
                    to go from our study halls in complete silence to our dormitories. Each dorm
                    contained about thirty beds, head to foot, with a yard of space on the sides.
                    Our bed had to be made properly each morning and all our clothes stowed in a
                    locker. The disciplined, communal life at St. Meinrad prepared me well for basic
                    training in the U.S. Army.</p>
                <p>Q: While you were getting your history and all, were you learning much about the
                    world? Was Indiana or the U.S. the prime focus, or was it broader?</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>BUCHE: Oh, no. Although it was a very small settlement isolated on a hilltop,
                    Saint Meinrad was cosmopolitan in many ways. They had visiting priests
                    constantly from other abbeys throughout the United States, and they encouraged
                    one or two of the students to come from Einsiedeln or other abbeys outside the
                    United States. I recall that we did not have any courses in Indiana history or
                    government. Our history courses covered America and the world. We had a heavy
                    dose of classical Greek and Roman history to complement our study of Greek and
                    Latin. Our professors had studied elsewhere for their advanced degrees, since at
                    that time, St. Meinrad was accredited to award only a BA. Interestingly, many
                    studied outside of the United States. Some of the monks completed their
                    theological studies at Saint Meinrad and then went elsewhere for graduate
                    training; usually to Catholic University (in Washington, DC) or to Notre Dame.
                    Others went elsewhere for theology after completing their undergraduate work.
                    Mainly, they went to Rome, Paris, Louvain (in Belgium), or Innsbruck (in
                    Austria). The latter was a favorite because it was German-speaking. Those monks
                    who were considered by the abbot as not having the ability to become teachers or
                    canon lawyers remained at St. Meinrad for their entire education.</p>
                <p>Q: St. Meinrad Seminary was of Swiss origins with connections to Austria and
                    Germany. While you were there, not too long after World War II, were you getting
                    any sort of reflections about Germany and what happened in Germany during the
                    Hitler time?</p>
                <p>BUCHE: No, we did not, as far as I can recall. We knew about the camps and the
                    extermination campaigns, but there was no emphasis given to the subject. It was
                    treated as part of history. We did not have any exhibits or any special lectures
                    on the holocaust. There were, however, no efforts as far as I know to turn
                    students away from the subject.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: What was more threatening to the Western world, as far as some of the
                    monks were concerned, was Communism. I recall at the time we were told to pray
                    for the Croatian priests and hierarchy who were being “unjustly” jailed or
                    executed by Tito. Also the subject of our prayers were the Catholic priests in
                    Eastern Europe who were persecuted by the Soviets. In later life I was quite
                    chagrined at my na�vet� when I realized that many of those priests were pretty
                    nasty people who were guilty of collaborating with the Nazis in persecuting Jews
                    and others.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: As I said, I went home every Christmas and during the summer. I think it
                    was in 1954, during the first summer I spent in West Lafayette, when I began
                    having serious doubts about my vocation to the priesthood. I took a job in a
                    factory making pre-fabricated houses, and worked the second shift from three
                    o'clock in the afternoon to midnight. I had every morning free and decided to
                    take some courses at Purdue University. I took two courses which were not
                    offered at St. Meinrad, an economics course and an advanced German literature
                    course. (I decided not to ask permission from St. Meinrad to take the courses,
                    since the answer would have been negative. The monks would not have objected to
                    the courses, but to the fact that I would come into contact with coeds.) And I
                    did come into daily contact with coeds, as I was the only male in the German
                    class and one of two or three males in the econ class. I began thinking whether
                    I really wanted to become a priest. At the end of the summer, the answer was
                    still yes, so I returned to St. Meinrad. I continued to think about that
                    all-important question and to pray for guidance. At Christmas time, I
                    participated in a wedding of a close friend from grade school, looked up a few
                    of my classmates from the summer session, and met the sons and daughters of some
                    of my parents' new friends and acquaintances in Lafayette. The question of my
                    future became more acute. I was leaning toward abandoning the goal of
                    priesthood, but decided to return to St. Meinrad to discuss the issue with my
                    confessor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were about how old then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: I must have been about 20.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>BUCHE: I told my father confessor at Saint Meinrad that I had some doubts, but I
                    thought the best thing to do would be to stay at the school - I was very happy
                    there - and wait until summertime to make up my mind. I did not think there was
                    a real need to make a quick decision. That was not, however, the way the monks
                    approached the issue. All I had to say was, “I have some doubts,” and the way
                    the Saint Meinrad mind worked was if you have doubts, you should not stay here.
                    You can resolve your doubts better by leaving immediately for two reasons. One,
                    you think you know what the priesthood is; you do not yet have the experience of
                    living as an adult lay person. Leave now, and if you wish, you can come back in
                    four or five years. What Father Adelbert told me seemed logical. He also told me
                    the second reason: “We don't want a lot of doubting, conflicted young men around
                    here because they would infect others.” I agreed to leave, but I first had to
                    finish some term papers and a few other projects. Father Adelbert said to forget
                    the papers and the projects and call my parents to tell them I planned to leave
                    in two days. I called up my father and said, “Dad, I'm leaving and coming home.”
                    He asked what made me change my mind, since I had said nothing to my family
                    during the Christmas break. I told him we could discuss that at home. And so
                    after some hasty farewells to my classmates and professors, I left. During the
                    six-hour bus trip home, I was filled with sadness and a fear of the unknown, but
                    also with great relief that I had at last made a decision. When I returned to
                    St. Meinrad for my first visit some eight months later, I then knew I had made
                    the right choice to leave. I have remained deeply appreciative of what I learned
                    at St. Meinrad, from the classrooms as well as from the way of life of the
                    monks. I have visited St. Meinrad dozens of times and have remained in contact
                    with some of my classmates and professors. I was delighted to have been invited
                    to teach at the College after I retired from the Foreign Service. I retain a
                    very fond feeling for Saint Meinrad. Father Adelbert's advice was sound: I had
                    doubts and resolved them, and I did come back, as an adjunct professor for two
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: I went home to West Lafayette. I already had a taste of Purdue, so I
                    thought I would like to go somewhere else to study. My father said I could go to
                    any college which awarded me a full scholarship, since he could afford to send
                    me only to Purdue. He was concerned about the costs of college for my four
                    siblings. He suggested I start immediately at Purdue and explore scholarships
                    from there. I could transfer only about two-thirds of my credits from St.
                    Meinrad, but I was determined to graduate from Purdue at the same time as if I
                    had stayed at the seminary. (Purdue would not give credit for my classes in
                    Latin, Greek, Church History, Biblical Studies, and Gregorian Chant.) I told my
                    academic adviser I intended to take extra classes to compensate for the
                    non-transferable credits. He was strongly against the suggestion, since I had a
                    heavy load of required science courses to make up. I persisted, so he had me
                    sign a paper that I had been warned.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: I found the science courses difficult at first and much more demanding
                    than what I had experienced at St. Meinrad. That should not have surprised me,
                    since Purdue was a technical university (The Boilermakers). I continued with
                    extra classes, another session of summer school, and passed several course
                    equivalency tests to obtain credits for English composition and literature. We
                    had covered that material in high school! I still ended up having to take some
                    basic science courses in my senior year to fulfill all the requirements for the
                    Bachelor of Science degree. Nevertheless, I graduated on schedule with a 3.9
                    average and the citation summa cum laude.</p>

                <p>BUCHE: It was Uncle Sam's will. While I was in Purdue, I was trying to figure out
                    what I really wanted to do, since I was not going to become a priest. I thought
                    of becoming a lawyer or a professor, but in the back of my mind was the idea of
                    doing something that would involve working or traveling overseas. My study of
                    German and classical languages and European history sparked that interest. I did
                    not think becoming a lawyer or college professor would necessarily lead me in
                    that direction. Faute de mieux, I figured becoming a college professor would be
                    better than being a lawyer. As a lawyer, I could occasionally travel overseas,
                    but if I chose to become a college professor, maybe I could study abroad, as
                    some of my classmates were doing, in Innsbruck, Paris, or Rome. I told my
                    parents I had decided to become a college professor, although I was not sure in
                    which discipline. Then one afternoon I had a class canceled, so I decided to
                    visit a professor in his office. Outside his office there was a month-old notice
                    on the bulletin board that the State Department was sending a recruiter to the
                    campus to speak about careers in the Foreign Service. The meeting was for that
                    very day and hour. I was intrigued with the idea, since I had never heard of the
                    Foreign Service. So I went to the lecture, picked up application forms, and
                    decided that this is something to pursue on the side, since it was an option for
                    going overseas and would not interfere with graduate work. I discovered that the
                    way to get into the Foreign Service was to take the written examination, which I
                    could do if I got the application in pretty quickly, which I did. I drove down
                    to Indianapolis to take the exam. I think it was six or seven weeks after I had
                    heard about it. I came very close to passing the test. Failing by such a narrow
                    margin was a challenge and a goad to sign up for the next exam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, with a 3.9 average and your record at St.

                <p>BUCHE: I had never flunked an exam in my whole life, and I got within one point
                    of passing, so I said to myself “I've got to pass this - if for no other reason
                    than to prove that I could have entered the Foreign Service if I had so
                    desired.” I did not realize that few undergraduates in their junior year even
                    took the exam, much less pass it. So I took it the following fall, and passed. I
                    was invited to sit for the oral examination. My attitude was, “Well, why not -
                    my favorite cousin lives in Cincinnati, so I'll drive down, take the exam, and
                    visit her.” It never occurred to me that I would not pass it, and so I went in
                    completely relaxed and very confident. I had nothing to lose. I even corrected
                    members of the examining panel. One examiner noted that I had studied German
                    literature and made some comments about Schiller and Goethe. He mixed up the
                    two, so I corrected him. Another panel member, noting that I had been studying
                    in a Catholic seminary, made a comment about the popes in Avignon that was wrong
                    by about a century in his timing. So, I corrected him, too. I thought that was
                    what was expected of me. I apparently answered their questions and defended my
                    positions to their satisfaction, since at the end of the exam, they came out and
                    said, “Congratulations, we want you in the Foreign Service.” And I said, “Oh,
                    that's fine, I am going to finish my senior year and then go to graduate school.
                    After I get my doctorate, I would definitely consider the Foreign Service.” They
                    looked at me incredulously and said they wanted me as soon as possible and that
                    the Personnel Department (PER) could probably process me in time for the March
                    A-100 class for newly-entering FSOs. As far as graduate work was concerned, that
                    was out of the question. I had to accept the offer or decline it. I was taken
                    aback, since I did not realize there was any urgency in actually joining the
                    Foreign Service after passing the exam. I was on the spot. I quickly made up my
                    mind. I dropped the idea of graduate school, since I did not even know what
                    specialty I wanted to pursue, but I was determined to graduate. I told them my
                    sine qua non of accepting their offer was that I be allowed to graduate
                    first.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I'm not surprised.</hi>

                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>BUCHE: The panel chairman replied “Is that your firm sine qua non?” And I said,
                    “Ita, vere.” And he said, “That sounds like yes.” I replied it was. He smiled
                    and offered me his hand in agreement. So I was allowed to finish my senior year.
                    I thought I had really pulled off a coup, because I knew I was going to receive
                    a draft notice from Uncle Sam in the next month or so telling me to report for
                    induction shortly after I graduated. I began scheming how I could use the
                    Foreign Service appointment to avoid the draft. I planned to write to the draft
                    board and say I cannot serve in the U.S. Army, since I am going to the
                    Department of State. So when I got my notice that I was to report on such and
                    such a day, I called the State Department Personnel Office. I told an officer in
                    Personnel about the induction notice and asked him to call up the appropriate
                    office of the Department of Defense and tell them that I was needed in the
                    Foreign Service and so could not serve in the army. He listened patiently and
                    then completely demolished my scheme. He said I was of marginal value to the
                    Foreign Service at this stage of my life. You are going to learn a lot as an
                    Army draftee. You will probably go overseas and learn something there, so when
                    you finish your military obligation, you will be of much more use to the
                    Department. You will also be more mature. I was really deflated by his response,
                    and terribly disappointed. I now had no alternative but to show up at the
                    induction center.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: After basic training at Fort Hood in Texas, I served in a small town in
                    Germany, called Crailsheim. The town was about half way between Stuttgart and
                    Nuremberg and was located on a major east-west highway and along a rail line. It
                    was an ideal location as a staging post for armor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in an armor unit?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>BUCHE: Yes, it was the Fourth Armored Division. The Fourth Armored Division had
                    stationed its tank battalions and mechanized infantry in that region of Germany,
                    so that we could quickly move eastward if the balloon went up. I was trained as
                    a tank commander in Fort Hood, Texas, which is nothing more than being in charge
                    of the tank. Each M-48 tank had a gunner, a loader, a driver, and a commander,
                    but that did not mean that I commanded anything other than the tank itself. I
                    took my orders from the platoon sergeant or lieutenant. After five months of
                    basic and armor training at Fort Hood, we were given leave for Christmas and
                    told to report to Fort Dix, New Jersey for transport to Germany. Several
                    thousand of us were crammed into an aging troopship, the U.S. Geiger, for a
                    ten-day January crossing of the Atlantic to Bremerhaven, Germany. From there we
                    went by railroad to Crailsheim. I was ecstatic to be in Europe, even though it
                    was as a draftee. We had our first field training exercise a week after arrival.
                    Training and driving conditions for the tanks were considerably more difficult
                    in Germany than in Texas. At Fort Hood, there were hundreds of miles of open
                    range for the tanks to use. Around Crailsheim, the secondary roads were twisty,
                    narrow, hilly, and at this time of year, icy; there were fruit orchards and
                    cultivated fields; there were buildings; and to add to the difficulties for the
                    tank drivers, the German populace were going about their everyday business. Our
                    battalion caused considerable property damage on the first day as tanks skidded
                    into parked cars, trees, fire hydrants, and even a few buildings. Since my file
                    indicated I could speak German, I was summoned by the battalion commander,
                    Lieutenant Colonel George Redheffer, from my tank and ordered to report
                    immediately to a Lieutenant Evans, who had been given responsibility for the
                    battalion's liaison with local civil officials a few days before the exercise..
                    The lieutenant had come over on the Geiger with us and knew nothing about civil
                    affairs. His primary task was platoon leader for the mortar unit, and he spent
                    his first week in Germany making sure the unit's men, vehicles, and weapons were
                    combat ready. I certainly did not know anything about the U.S. Army's handling
                    of civil affairs, but I could see what had to be done. Our immediate task was to
                    placate some very angry Germans. Evans and I consulted the instructions and
                    forms from the European Command about how to initiate the claims process.
                    Lieutenant Evans was delighted that I was willing to take the lead, as long as
                    he was seen to be in charge. After the exercise was ended, there was an enormous
                    amount of work ahead of us with the claims process. I was officially transferred
                    to the mortar platoon and told to assist Lieutenant Evans. He still had the
                    full-time job as platoon leader, so I was given de-facto responsibility for
                    civil affairs and maneuver-damage control and compensation and completed the
                    work by myself. Since I was an enlisted man, I could not sign anything. I had to
                    do the work in the field and then bring it to Lt. Evans to sign. Within a few
                    weeks, we had the first reaction from EUCOM. A colonel in Heidelberg wrote a
                    complimentary report to the Battalion Commander Redheffer on Lt. Evans for his
                    sensitive interaction with local German officials and the expeditious and
                    correct handling of the maneuver-damage claims. Our battalion commander was, of
                    course, greatly pleased, since he was ultimately responsible. With those two
                    officers content, I was left pretty much on my own. Our next field exercise was
                    a two-week NATO maneuver involving several army divisions, including Bundeswehr
                    units. Weather conditions were almost as bad as in January at the beginning.
                    Then a sudden warm spell descended, and the fields and dirt roads were no longer
                    firmly frozen. The tanks chewed up the roads and fields. A new flood of angry
                    officials and farmers and damage claims. I was fully employed for months. I had
                    a great deal of freedom. I had my first taste of interacting with another
                    culture and bureaucracy. I was delighted with the experience.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you in Bavaria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: We were on the Bavarian border, between Bavaria and Baden-W�rttemburg. The
                    first town to the east of us was Ansbach, in Bavaria. The people of the
                    Crailsheim area, even the ones who lived a short distance over the border in
                    Bavaria, tended not to speak the Bavarian dialect, but rather Swabian
                    (Schw�bisch as it is called in German). There was also a sub-dialect that was
                    called Hohenlohisch, which was spoken by the older generation. The town (and
                    castle) of Hohenlohe was the ancestral home of Price Phillip of Britain. I was
                    interested in such things as German dialects. Although I could not speak either
                    Hohenlohisch or Schw�bisch, I eventually learned to understand a little. I made
                    a lot of inquiries about what was the meaning of this and that word or phrase. I
                    was a source of amusement to many of the farmers because I spoke a German that
                    was not at all colloquial. It was a classical German. Of course, they understood
                    it, but they thought it was amusing that I would use some words that had dropped
                    out of modern German or had taken on different meanings, - and some of them were
                    just plain wrong for the context. Some, however, were pretty elegant, but just
                    no longer used in everyday speech.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how long were you in the military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: About twenty-one months. I was able to get an early discharge based on
                    “hardship” because I wanted to go to Tuebingen University in Germany. I wrote
                    the Department of Defense that if I were not discharged by a certain date, I
                    could not go to that university and thus my future career in the Department of
                    State might be harmed. There was no emergency situation that demanded my
                    presence with the battalion, so I thought my chances were good. I had worked
                    closely with officers in our battalion headquarters during my assignment in
                    Germany, and my successful results made them look good, so they were willing to
                    endorse my request for an early discharge. My request was approved. I later
                    learned that in peacetime, such requests were quite frequent and were routinely
                    granted on the basis of having to do farm work or seasonal labor or for family
                    problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say that you wanted to go to a German university.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>BUCHE: That was my desire. When early in the training cycle at Fort Hood I
                    learned that our entire unit was to be sent to Germany, it was the best news I
                    had since induction day. The news made up for the loss of what I would have much
                    rather been doing, namely training with the State Department instead of the
                    Army, with so many boring hours marching, saluting, firing the rifle, plus KP
                    and endless inspections. But the fact that I was going to Germany was a goal I
                    was about to achieve- not through anything on my part, however. I happened to be
                    assigned to the right unit at the right time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in the Army in Germany, did you ever get to
                        ouConsulate General in Stuttgart?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: I went there once to get a passport, but the Vice Consul would not issue
                    me one. There was a regulation stating that U.S. military personnel stationed in
                    Germany could not be issued passports unless they could prove that they were
                    going to visit a country, where the US military ID card would not be recognized.
                    And the only place I could think of was East Germany, and that was off-limits to
                    us. I told the Vice Consul, Barney Stokes, I simply wanted a passport. I had
                    never had a passport. He said to come back within 90 days of being discharged,
                    and I would be eligible for a passport. Although my request was denied, Stokes
                    did accept my application. He said it would be kept for a year in the files. I
                    was already contemplating applying for an early discharge overseas.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, about the time when you were there, I was a passport officer in
                    Frankfurt, and we sure as hell didn't want to have the whole US Army getting
                    passports. I mean it's just an awful lot of work for no useful purpose.</p>
                <p>BUCHE: I have a theory that the Army did not want the soldiers to have passports
                    because if they were out late at night or drinking too much and the MP's came
                    into the bar to check on them, the G.I. could just flip out his passport and
                    say, “I'm a tourist here, so move on!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What university were you going to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: T�bingen.</p>

                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>BUCHE: I was there for a semester and a summer. Because of my work in civil
                    affairs and the fact that I could not take leave, I was able to go to T�bingen
                    University about a month before I was actually discharged. I used my accrued
                    leave and some passes. I worked this out with my commanding officer, who was
                    very supportive. He and his boss were grateful, because my work with the
                    maneuver damage problems and with the German authorities brought them praise on
                    several occasions from the Commanding General of the Fourth Armored Division in
                    G�ppingen. The US Military Command in Germany placed high priority on good
                    relations with German officials and civilians, so commendations along that line
                    really helped the careers of the two men. My commanding officer also cited me
                    for my outstanding work in civil affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were at T�bingen in 1959 to about 1960?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: I enrolled as a regular student at Tuebingen in January 1959, and hoped to
                    stay for several years. I took all my courses for credit because I thought I
                    would continue for another year at least. I was not going to take the visiting
                    student approach. I chose T�bingen over Munich or Heidelberg because T�bingen
                    did not have a visiting student program. Both Heidelberg and Munich had exchange
                    programs with US universities, and so attracted hundreds of American students
                    for one or two semesters. I also chose T�bingen because it was small and
                    relatively isolated. There were few foreigners there. It was reputed to be one
                    of the most traditional German universities, and several German authors whom I
                    admired had studied in T�bingen or had taught there. I did not start classes
                    until late February of 1959. I stayed in Germany until August of that year. I
                    went through the semester and that summer. I had wanted to stay for the fall
                    semester and the following year, but an officer in the Department's Personnel
                    Office called me around June to tell me that there was an opening in the A-100
                    class for new officers and that I had to make that opening in September.
                    (Apparently there were extra funds that had to be spent before the end of the
                    fiscal year.) Otherwise I could not be assured of a Foreign Service appointment.
                    I think that if had said I could not make the September class, but I could make
                    the next one, they would have agreed. When I said I was thinking about the fall
                    semester, he said there was no obligation under law to keep my appointment open.
                    I had to make an important decision. After a few moments, I replied I would be
                    there for the September class. I could not resist telling him that when I wanted
                    the Department to take me, after I graduated and before I was inducted, the
                    response was “Go to the Army and get some experience overseas; now that am
                    getting that experience in Germany, the Department urgently wants me.” He
                    laughed.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: So I said, “Fine, I'll be there.”</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you do a little comparing and contrasting, Purdue
                        witT�bingen, as far as education?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Well, Purdue was a typical American university, where the classes were a
                    mixture of lecture and discussions. There were also workshops and labs. The
                    professors and particularly the graduate assistants were accessible and
                    encouraged us to meet periodically with them. We had tests or quizzes throughout
                    the semester, and in the upper level classes we had term papers to write. The
                    library was open, and we had access to the stacks. There were also staff
                    counselors or advisers for the students, plus a clinic for minor illnesses.
                    Attendance was taken in many of the classes. Attendance and absences were noted;
                    the students were on a short leash. The American universities today are quite
                    different, but this was mid-1950. In T�bingen, there were many differences.
                    Class attendance was optional. There were large lecture halls packed with more
                    students than available chairs, and where the professors spoke without questions
                    from the students, The lectures were fascinating and showed the erudition of
                    theprofessor. I had the impression they were addressing their colleagues and not
                    the students around them. I was quite surprised at my first lecture. The
                    professor entered exactly fifteen minutes late; the students arose and began
                    stamping their feet; he surveyed the hundreds of assembled students; made a
                    slight bow which instantly quieted the hall; and began his lecture. At the end,
                    the process was repeated. I made a special effort to meet with my professors
                    several times during the semester, since I thought that was expected. I learned,
                    however, that for the first several years in a German university, one short,
                    formal meeting was the norm. Graduate assistants helped the professors do
                    research; they did not have much to do with the students. The library was not
                    user-friendly. I had to order a book and wait for several hours before it was
                    delivered. There was no browsing. Fortunately, I did not get sick, for there was
                    no student health clinic. I realized I was on my own at T�bingen. No one was
                    going to force me to go to a class or take my attendance. The idea was that the
                    students were capable of making their own decisions. They could finish their
                    work in five, seven, or even ten years if they so chose. There was little
                    pressure to take a minimum number of classes. It was up to each student to set
                    the pace. I had a paper to write in each class. I took four classes, and so
                    worked awfully hard. My results were not bad. The students did not receive a
                    letter or number grade on the paper or for the class. We were given a notation
                    such as good, outstanding, or acceptable. I had not heard of anyone's paper
                    being marked “failure.” Sometimes the professors would add other comments on the
                    paper. At the end of the semester, the student would collect a certificate that
                    he or she had successfully participated in the course. These were called
                    Seminarscheine. When a student had a sufficient number of Seminarscheine, it was
                    time to begin the process of writing the thesis. That meant finding a professor
                    to direct the research and to help with admission to other higher level

                        icontact with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>BUCHE: My initial contacts were with several students who were not very serious
                    about their studies. They were intelligent and had surmounted the difficult
                    entrance requirements, but they were not yet prepared to devote their time to
                    scholarly pursuits. That would come later. Life as a university student was
                    pleasant for them. They were planning to spend seven or eight years of their
                    lives at Tuebingen, with perhaps one year in between at another university.
                    Rushing through their university phase in five years was not their intention.
                    They liked parties, drinking, travel, and socializing. They were the first
                    students I met who showed any interest in me. We first met not in a classroom,
                    but in an old, traditional student restaurant called, “Tante Emelia,” where I
                    ate regularly. They were curious about an American who spoke pretty good German,
                    knew something about their country, was Catholic, and was not a socialist. They
                    were kind enough to invite me to some of their parties at their student
                    fraternity, Burschenschaft Borussia. At Purdue, I had experienced students whose
                    idea of college life was fraternities, football games, and beer parties, but my
                    Tuebingen colleagues seemed to be more interesting. I enjoyed their parties,
                    although the heavy drinking and rowdiness did not sit well with me. It became
                    clear to me that I was in with a group whose life style and outlook were quite
                    different from my own. They were from wealthy families, very conservative in
                    their politics, strongly nationalistic, not very critical about the Third Reich,
                    and disdainful of any students who espoused radical or socialist ideas. Too
                    often I heard their lament that if only the West had early on joined with
                    Germany to fight the Soviets, everything would have worked out well. There would
                    be no Soviet Union, no iron curtain, no divided Germany, but rather a successful
                    modern crusade against Bolshevism! I thought their version of recent German
                    history was completely wacko, but found them interesting interlocutors. After we
                    had been together for a few parties, they told me their fraternity still
                    practiced dueling. I was shocked, but fascinated. I knew that dueling
                    fraternities had been forbidden by the Occupation Forces after World War II, but
                    with the return of German sovereignty, there was a quiet resurgence among some
                    of the more conservative Burschenschaften. My hosts probed me about my reactions
                    toward dueling. Completely against it, I responded. They tried to convince me
                    otherwise and praised the virtues of dueling...develops discipline, skill,
                    self-confidence, courage, etc. They explained that the modern version of dueling
                    is different from what their fathers' generation experienced. There are masks
                    and heavily-padded clothing; no one gets hurt. It is even an Olympic sport. I
                    was unconvinced, but I decided to keep an open mind. Gradually it dawned on me
                    they were probing to determine whether to ask me to join Burschenschaft
                    Borussia. (Since I was enrolled as a normal student, they assumed I would remain
                    at Tuebingen for a couple of years. I did not disabuse them of that assumption,
                    since I hoped to remain at least until the summer of 1960.) They mentioned that
                    after the War, the fraternities were encouraged by the universities and the
                    government to become more open and democratic. Many fraternities, including
                    Burschenshaft Borussia, took in a few, carefully-selected “internationals”. It
                    was about this time that I was beginning to meet other students who were more my
                    style. I was eager to expand my social circle. My newer acquaintances were
                    serious students and seemed determined to finish in five or so years in order to
                    begin their careers as lawyers, journalists, doctors, or whatever. I did not
                    break with my friends from Burschenschaft Borussia, since we still ate daily
                    lunch and dinner together at “Tante Emelia,” and occasionally met for a few
                    beers in the evenings. I believe they came to realize I was not the type of
                    “international” they wanted to tap for their fraternity.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had they gotten away from the scars?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Before the second World War, a dueling scar had long been a badge of honor
                    in certain levels of German society. After the War, there was practically no way
                    to get such a scar because the duelers wore masks. Some men still wanted a scar,
                    so they would go to a surgeon who used a scalpel under anesthesia to cut the
                    scar in just the right place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about politics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: This was the Adenauer era, CDU time. I was fascinated by German national
                    politics, and was staunchly CDU. I thought Adenauer was a great leader. My
                    professor for a German history course for the period between the two World Wars
                    asked me in my first meeting about my views on German politics. I told him I was
                    deeply impressed by Adenauer and the CDU. He asked me whether I had ever studied
                    the Socialist Party of Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The SPD.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: I said, “Well, not much at all, were they not close to the Communists in
                    the Weimar era and are they not opposed to NATO and for closer relations with
                    East Germany?” He had a look of disgust on his face and asked which party forced
                    the Communists out of the German labor unions. I had no idea, but from the way
                    he asked the question, it must have been the SPD. I hesitatingly replied, the
                    SPD? Of course, he said and added that I apparently had much to learn about the
                    last forty years of German history. He said he expected me to take the
                    opportunity while in his class to make up for my past deficiencies. End of
                    discussion! I was humiliated, but resolved to make up for my lack of knowledge
                    of this area. I immediately went to the library and ordered several books on the
                    Weimar period to see what the Socialist Party had done. It was clear that the
                    Socialists were much more committed to democracy and social justice than the
                    Catholic parties and the rightists. It was the Catholics and the rightists who
                    played key roles in sabotaging the Weimar Republic and assisting the rise of
                    Nazism. I recalled a course at St. Meinrad on modern European history, where the
                    professor repeated castigated the Socialist Parties of Europe for their
                    opposition to the Catholic Church and the Papacy. I even recalled having to
                    study several encyclicals from the late 19th century strongly condemning
                    socialism. My history courses at Purdue did not cover that era, so I had no
                    counterview.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they got quite close to Hitler.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>BUCHE: Yes, it was the Catholic parties and others on the right who held their
                    nose and voted for Hitler. Some of the first victims of Hitler were not the
                    Jews, but Communists and Socialists. Although my first meeting with the
                    professor was embarrassing, it turned out to be a positive experience. I spent
                    many hours reading about the Weimar Republic and the role of the SPD. That was
                    the theme of my paper for his class. He marked it ausgezeichnet, (outstanding)!
                    I also read about the SPD in contemporary German politics. Later, when Willy
                    Brandt became Chancellor, I felt I knew all about him and his Party, thanks to
                    the professor's challenge to my one-sided educational experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Normally one thinks of college students as going through
                        theiradical stage as part of their development. Did you find much of
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Yes, there were some, but I believe they were the minority. T�bingen was
                    probably the most conservative university in Germany. It was in a conservative
                    area (solidly CDU). There were two highly renowned faculties of theology,
                    Catholic and Protestant. I understood at the time they were both conservative,
                    although that certainly changed. There were many theological students there,
                    mostly on the Protestant side. I was told the best and the brightest of the
                    would-be lawyers were not choosing T�bingen. There were no economics or
                    sociology departments, and the science faculties, other than medicine, were not
                    particularly noteworthy. The history department was more focused on the distant
                    past rather than modern times, and the political science department was only a
                    few years old. There were excellent departments of classical languages and
                    archaeology. Tuebingen did not have the faculties or the tradition which would
                    attract many students on the left. It was home to the conservative elements, at
                    least when I was there. There was a small Communist student group and a somewhat
                    larger Socialist student group. They put up a lot of posters, held rallies and
                    debates, and ran candidates for student offices, but they were a minority. Often
                    they attacked each other with more vehemence than was directed against the
                    conservative groups. Prospective students with a leftist philosophy would find
                    the universities in Heidelberg, Berlin, or Munich more in line with their way of
                    thinking. I really liked the institution and the experience. I was not
                    interested in getting into student politics. I just wanted to study and attend
                    the lectures and seminars. I had friends and acquaintances from a broad
                    political spectrum.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you left there at the end of the summer of 1959. You
                        entered the Foreign Service when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: In September of 1959.</p>

                <p>BUCHE: The A-100 course. It was held at the time in Arlington,Virginia, in the
                    old Foreign Service Institute.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it might have even been in the garage.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: It was the garage, yes. That is where it was. The garage of the old
                    Arlington Towers Apartment Building. It remained there for three or four years
                    and then moved to the high-rise. I remember the windowless rooms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of your class that came in with
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: I was impressed with them. I was wondering how I was ever going to compete
                    against these very bright people. There were twenty five of us, all male, all
                    white, all Christian (whether they practiced or not). There were no Jews. Oh, I
                    forgot - there was one Jew. This is interesting. I did not make any comparisons
                    at the time. It was perhaps several weeks into the class, when someone commented
                    about the class composition: “There are no Orientals, blacks, or females, and
                    Bob Kaufman is the only Jew.” That was a typical Foreign Service A-100
                    class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, absolutely, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: I assumed this was the way it was. I was very impressed with the quality
                    of my classmates. I thought they were all going to do very, very well. Most had
                    advanced degrees; several were lawyers; about ten had served in the military as
                    officers. I was the only one who had served as an enlisted man. About half were
                    married. I liked most of them from the first day, and I still count a half dozen
                    of them among my friends. Surprisingly, in my thirty-five years of the FS, I did
                    not serve together with any of my classmates. I was one of the youngest in the
                    class, just twenty-four at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about what you learned about the
                        Department oState and the Foreign Service? Was it useful?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>BUCHE: I did not find it terribly useful. It was fascinating, but I can not say
                    it was useful. It was often too academic. Our lecturers were mainly from the
                    Foreign Service Institute. Occasionally, a Desk Officer would come over for two
                    hours from the Department to discuss an issue or a region. I found the Desk
                    Officers interesting and what they had to say germane. We could identify more
                    closely with a Desk Officer's message than with a historical survey by one of
                    the scholars on the FSI staff of an area covering several centuries. We heard
                    dozens of examples from the Desk Officers about what their work was. It was 99%
                    operational: solve this or that problem; write a memo to the Assistant Secretary
                    or occasionally the Secretary; arrange a meeting with the Assistant Secretary
                    for an ambassador and take notes; expedite a visa; brief a Congressional staffer
                    or a newly assigned officer; speak to A-100 class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, of course, that's the State Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: That's correct. That should have told us something. The work of the
                    Foreign Service was not about the “Big Picture”. There is no time for that at an
                    embassy or on a country desk. We did not spend much time on learning how to
                    draft a good telegram or what should be put into an airgram. How an embassy or a
                    consulate functioned was covered in two lectures. We were told there is such a
                    variety in the overseas missions that we would have to learn the particulars at
                    post. Also, we were told very little about airfreight, estimates for packing
                    charges, pay advances, temporary housing benefits, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: The practical side of Foreign Service life was hardlmentioned. But it was
                    a very pleasant 60 days - or was it 90 days?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think about 90 days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: I looked forward every day to coming to the classroom. It was exciting. My
                    career was about to begin. I even had to admit to myself that what the Personnel
                    Officer told me when I telephoned him requesting his intervention with the
                    Pentagon was correct. My time in the Army and my experiences in Germany did make
                    me a better candidate for a successful career with the FS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were doing this, what were you thinking about
                        doing?Where and what type of work seemed to appeal to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>BUCHE: I wanted to go back to Germany and work in the political section of the
                    Embassy or in one of the consulates. My German was pretty good, and my Army and
                    Tuebingen experience gave me confidence to request an assignment to Germany as
                    my first choice. Also, I had become interested in a student at Tuebingen and
                    wanted to pursue the relationship. My FSI adviser encouraged me in my choice of
                    a German assignment. I was really delighted when an officer from PER told me I
                    was to be assigned to Stuttgart, Germany. Since it was a first posting, I would
                    be on a rotation, starting in the Visa Section. I was assured that there would
                    be plenty of time to do political reporting and toward the end of tour, I would
                    actually work in the Political Section. I concluded that all the rumors we had
                    heard about the unpredictability or irrationality of the assignment process for
                    an A-100 class were highly exaggerated. Some of my colleagues received postings
                    which were not asked for, but there was some logic to them. I could not have
                    been more pleased. We still had two weeks of A-100, but I began making
                    preparations for Stuttgart. I wrote the obligatory introductory letter to the
                    Consul General and even made it personal by saying that my passport had been
                    issued by him as a special favor. When I returned to the Consulate General after
                    receiving my discharge from the US Army, I reminded Barney Stokes that I had
                    passed all the entry requirements for the Foreign Service and would begin my
                    career after another year at Tuebingen. He asked one of the Foreign Service
                    Nationals to prepare my passport. Then he asked, “Would you like to meet Consul
                    General Moorhead?” I said, “I would be honored.” I thought that would be a
                    greater thrill than meeting an army general. And so we went together to the CG's
                    office. After chatting for a few minutes, he said, “I understand you're here to
                    be issued a passport. I would be pleased to sign it for a future colleague.” I
                    went back downstairs took the oath of allegiance and soon had my first passport
                    in hand. That was in the spring of 1959, and now in December of 1959, I was
                    going to be serving in that very Consulate General. I did not have to go to a
                    language class, since I tested well in German. I did not go to Stuttgart,
                    however! Three days before I was supposed to fly out of Washington, another
                    officer, Charles [B.] Schaller, and I were urgently summoned to EUR Personnel
                    from the A-100 class. (Charles was supposed to go to the CG at Frankfurt.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, out of class?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>BUCHE: We were in the last day of classes at FSI. Charles and I had no inkling
                    why we were being summoned. We assumed it was for some last minute
                    administrative requirement. The officer, an Irishman from New York, sat me down
                    and told me I was not going to Stuttgart; but rather to what sounded like
                    “Taranna.” So I thought for a moment and replied, “Sir, I did not realize we had
                    diplomatic relations with Albania.” He said, “Who said anything about Albania?
                    You're going to Taranna - that's in Canada. Don't you know where Taranna is?”
                    And I said, “you mean” Toronto,” but what happened to my assignment to
                    Stuttgart?” He said, “We're canceling that, since two officers didn't get off
                    language probation after four months of training, so they have to go to a
                    German-speaking post to improve their German if they are to be promoted. I told
                    him switching assignments did not seem logical or fair. He responded that I did
                    not have to worry about language probation. “That's the reason you and your
                    friend out there are going to Taranna and Southampton respectively.” So I asked
                    when I had to go. He said, “Well, you're all packed to go to Stuttgart, so leave
                    for Canada in a few days. You are needed there urgently.” I told him I had
                    already sent my airfreight to Stuttgart.” He said, “Don't worry, we'll have the
                    Consulate forward it to you in Taranna.” I was deeply disappointed, but I saw no
                    alternative. So I said, “Well, what do I do now? Do I have to write another
                    letter to the Consul General in Toronto?” He said, “No, pick up the phone and
                    tell him you're coming. He already knows about it since we sent him notice of
                    your assignment. I went right down to the transport office in the Department,
                    canceled my Pan Am flight, and got a ticket on the New York Central Railroad to
                    Toronto. I decided those rumors about awful assignments of officers from the
                    A-100 class had some foundation after all.</p>
                <p>Q: I'll go get my calendar, and we'll pick it up later. I like to quit at a post,
                    so we are going to Toronto in December of 1959. I can't think of any great
                    political crises at that time in Toronto, but maybe we'll find out what
                    happens.</p>
                <p>BUCHE: Canada was not only completely devoid of political crises at the time, but
                    the Consulate General was about to close for the holidays. I called Consul
                    General Robert Memminger from the Department, but did not get through to him.
                    His secretary said it was really not necessary to speak to the Consul General to
                    say I was coming, since they had been informed of that. She would tell him of my
                    call. The most-recent arrival at the post, Jim Marshall, would meet me at the
                    train station. He was there to greet me. He took me to the hotel. He said “I
                    suppose you are going to go home now. I understand you are from Indiana.” I
                    replied I planned to stay in Toronto since I had been told by the Personnel
                    Officer in the Department that I was urgently needed. Jim seemed puzzled and
                    replied that the Consulate was closing for the Christmas holidays. “We can not
                    take leave during the summer because of the rush of visas, so we close the
                    Consulate from the 20th of December to about the 10th of January, so everyone
                    can take leave. There will be only a few of us in town, but you are welcome to
                    stay in your hotel and get to know the city.” Jim urged me to go home to spend
                    Christmas with my family in Indiana. I decided that was a good suggestion.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we'll pick it up at that point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Since this was my first assignment as a Foreign Service officer, I was on
                    a rotational basis. I started in the Visa Correspondence Section working for a
                    Canadian national employee who taught me what I needed to know. I just kept
                    thinking if I had just had her in the visa course at the FSI, I would have
                    learned a lot more. For about a year, I answered correspondence from people
                    wanting to know about the status of their case, whether they were eligible, what
                    to do about the various types of INS petitions, checking employment
                    certifications, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These weren't Canadians, were they, for the most
                        part?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: A good part were Canadians, since most of our correspondence concerned
                    immigrant visas. Abouhalf of our cases were Europeans who had come to Canada,
                    and had decided they would like to move to the United States. We had some
                    correspondence involving non-immigrant visas, but that was perfunctory.
                    Canadians did not need a visa just to visit the U.S., but if they wanted to
                    work, they needed an immigrant visa. I spent a year doing that. Since I was
                    interested in political and economic reporting, and there was no political
                    officer, I was able on the side to cover the developments in local politics.
                    Canada was going through a nationalistic phase at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>BUCHE: I was at the Consulate General from December of 1959 until January of
                    1962. Canada was going through a phase of trying to distance itself politically,
                    to some extent, from the United States. They were tired of being taken for
                    granted. When I arrived, there were several issues in the air. One was a sudden
                    cancellation by the U.S. of a large defense contract. One of the Canadian
                    companies was to be a subcontractor to a US manufacturer for bomber parts or
                    sections. For some reason or other, the Pentagon decided to cancel the contract.
                    I am not sure which U.S. company was the prime contractor, but for them it was
                    only a minor problem. They would just put more resources into another plane or
                    weapons system, but for the Canadian company, it meant bankruptcy. The company
                    had staked everything on being an important subcontractor to an American weapons
                    system. That was just one event, but there were a lot of others. There were
                    disputes about television advertising of American products, the flooding of
                    Canada with American publications, American content on Canadian television, and
                    the reception of American TV in Canada. It was an interesting time, and I did
                    some reporting on the latent anti-Americanism. One of the constant messages from
                    the Canadian business world was: we love the United States; we spend winter
                    vacations down there, but you really cause us problems with your policies and
                    laws. Also there were numerous auto manufacturing facilities in Canada,
                    subsidiaries of Ford, GM, and Chrysler. We were in the midst of an economic
                    downturn, and the clich� “the United States catches a cold, but Canada gets
                    pneumonia” was once again evident. There were layoffs in the U.S., but the
                    headquarters of the American car manufacturers would shut down entire plants in
                    Canada. The feeling in Canada was that American management felt no loyalty to
                    Canadian workers, regardless of the economics involved. This was not only in the
                    auto industry, but in most of the Canadian subsidiaries of American
                    corporations. It was nearly impossible to prove such a case, but the Canadians
                    believed they unfairly were the victims of economic imperialism and bullying by
                    the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John Diefenbaker was the prime minister?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Yes, he was the big winner in the election. He and his Progressive
                    Conservative Party came into power after many years of Liberal control because
                    the Canadian voters saw Lester Pearson, the incumbent Liberal Prime Minister as
                    just too internationalist, too liberal, too much in the pocket of the Americans.
                    Reality may have been otherwise, but that's basically the way the Canadian voter
                    saw it. Diefenbaker based his campaign on an appeal to Canadian emotions, pride,
                    fear, and nationalism (read veiled anti-Americanism) and won. He was never a
                    beloved figure, but he was a clever politician who knew how to manipulate the
                    issues, especially the appeal to Canadian nationalism. We covered the Ontario
                    by-elections (held when a sitting Member of Parliament died or retired).</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>Jim Marshall and I reported on the 1960 parliamentary election for the Province
                    of Ontario. This taught me a lesson I remembered for the rest of my Foreign
                    Service career. I spent lots of time trying to figure out which of the five
                    candidates would be successful in winning the Progressive Conservative
                    nomination to run against the Liberal Party's candidate. It was the Canadian
                    equivalent to the American primaries, except the choice was made at a convention
                    rather than by a popular vote. Since Ontario was traditionally Progressive
                    Conservative, the winner of the PC Party nomination usually won the ensuing
                    election. While the outcome of the PC Party convention was of some interest to
                    the Embassy, it was fascinating and important to me. I attended some of the
                    preliminary rallies and met the candidates. I decided who was going to win, who
                    would come in second, third, fourth, and fifth. The actual process involved a
                    series of votes by the convention, with the candidate receiving the least number
                    of votes being eliminated until there was only one candidate remaining. Two days
                    before the actual convention vote, I put my predictions and the reasoning behind
                    my choices in a telegram to the Embassy and to Washington. I followed the
                    proceedings at the convention carefully. When the results came out, they were
                    exactly as I had predicted. I had hit the jackpot; I had correctly picked the
                    double Trifecta. I was elated. The Consul General congratulated me, but I wanted
                    also to get some kudos from the Embassy. A day later, the Counselor of Embassy
                    for Political Affairs called me with some questions about the convention. He
                    opened the conversation by saying “We noticed you called the winner.” And I
                    replied, “I called not only the winner, but I called the correct sequence of
                    elimination of the other candidates.” He replied “You know, John, that's all
                    fluff. You were rather foolhardy to do that, though. We don't care who's going
                    to be the first of five eliminated or the next. We want to know who the winner
                    is likely to be. Very often, if you want to be so clever and try to call them
                    that way and you are wrong, you might be criticized for the secondary miscalls,
                    even if you call the winner correctly. Don't be a show-off. In the future,
                    concentrate your efforts on who is going to win an election and what it means to
                    the United States or what it does not mean to the United States. Pay attention
                    to what is important in political reporting. You are not paid to be a
                    handicapper for a horse race.” By this time I was standing at attention holding
                    the phone. I said “Yes, Sir, Yes, Sir.” He said, “Well, you're new at the game.
                    You were just damned lucky.” I replied, “Well, I guess I was.” He closed by
                    thanking me for putting in the effort, but told me to rememberhis advice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a good lesson.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: I agree.</p>
                <p>Q: A good lesson to be learned, because I think this is sort of the psychic
                    prizes you get if you can call elections, which sometimes doesn't really make a
                    hell of a lot of difference, but we spend an awful lot of time at it.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>BUCHE: I also came to realize it really did not matter that much in the big
                    scheme of things who won the parliamentary nomination of the Conservative Party
                    in Ontario. Well, in any case, I learned a lesson. But I still was pretty proud
                    of what I had done. Q: Of course you were. One has to set these things up. You
                    had your own little reward system.</p>
                <p>BUCHE: Then I went back to visas and passports. I eventually went from the Visa
                    Correspondence Section to issuing passports to the large number of Americans in
                    Ontario. I was not thrilled with consular work, but I knew this was part of my
                    training, something I had to go through, like being a novice in a monastery, or
                    a pledge in a fraternity. What really began to interest me, although I had no
                    interest whatsoever before Toronto, was Africa. Africa was just coming into the
                    headlines - the independence movements and the retreat of colonialism. I got
                    involved in a fund-raiser to set up scholarships for African students to study
                    at Canadian universities.. The project was the idea of a Canadian business man,
                    Jim Grant, and was taken up by a consortium of Toronto churches. One of the
                    fundraisers came to the Consulate and asked whether one of the officers would
                    volunteer to call on American businesses. I asked Consul General Memminger
                    whether I was allowed to do that, and he said, “Why are you asking me?” I
                    replied I did not know whether I was permitted to call on American companies and
                    ask for money for a registered Canadian charity. He said, “ John, you can send a
                    request to the Ethics Office in the Department of State, along with written
                    disclaimers, or you can just go out and do it.” “I'm going to tell you a story,
                    John. There were two monks in a very strict, isolated monastery who had spent
                    their whole adult lives there. On the day they were celebrating their 50th
                    anniversary of entering the monastery, they were invited to the abbot's
                    quarters. One monk went in, spent some time there, and came out. Then the other
                    went in, sat down, and said to the abbot, “I've been a good monk for fifty years
                    and on this special occasion, I want your permission to do three things that are
                    not allowed by the Holy Rule of the Order: smoke a cigarette, drink a Coca-Cola,
                    and read a newspaper.” The abbot replied that such things were not morally bad,
                    but were not allowed by the Holy Rule, so he said, “Permission denied!” The monk
                    was shocked and hurt, and he blurted out, “I know my confrere did it, because I
                    can smell the cigarette - there's the butt - and there are two empty Coca-Cola
                    bottles over there in the corner, and I see some newspapers around. How come he
                    got to do all those things and I can't?” The abbot looked him in the eye and
                    said, “He didn't ask!” So I solicited money from several American
                    corporations.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the issue of Quebec come up in Toronto? Were we
                        monitorinthat at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>BUCHE: The prevalent attitude in Ontario in the early 1960s was “those dumb
                    Frenchmen in Quebec wouldn't dare to break off from Canada.” The Ontario people
                    did not take the threat of Quebec independence seriously. “It will never
                    happen,” and “They'd be stupid to even consider it.” We reported the prevailing
                    feeling, but were not doing any special monitoring. The Embassy was covering the
                    issue from a national perspective. One issue we did follow was the debate over
                    the sale to the U.S. of oil and gas from the western provinces. The headquarters
                    for many Canadian natural resource companies were in Toronto. They wanted to
                    sell petroleum products to the U.S. on a log-term basis, with dedicated
                    pipelines and refineries and processing plants. Canadian national policy at that
                    time was against long-term arrangements. They could sell certain amounts on a
                    spot or short-term basis, but no north-south pipelines from some of the fields
                    directly down to Kansas, the Dakotas, or Chicago. The U.S. would welcome new
                    supplies of energy for some of our northern states. Most of the American oil
                    companies had Canadian subsidiaries, and were eager to direct production
                    southward. The western provinces of Canada would also have benefitted. The
                    national government was mindful of the U.S. auto industry's damaging practices
                    in Canada and was determined to keep the energy sector from falling into
                    American hands. Ottawa also wanted an abundant, secure, Canadian source of
                    energy for the eastern provinces, where the bulk of the population lived. While
                    the prairie provinces were not talking secession, they were upset at Ottawa's
                    policies. I think this showed up in the election results later on, in the
                    mid-'60s and '70s. The western provinces protested the policies of both the
                    Conservatives and Liberals by voting for what had been previously splinter or
                    protest parties, the New Democratic Party and the Socialist Party. That was
                    something normally not associated with farmers and businessmen out in the west,
                    but they were really upset with the policies of the eastern-oriented
                    government.</p>
                <p>Q: Also regarding anti-Americanism, the Canadian version thereof, I understand
                    that Ontario was the hotbed and it was a residue left over from the loyalists
                    who left the United States. The people in other parts came to Canada with
                    well-developed ties backwards and forwards and did not get as upset over America
                    as they did in Ontario.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>BUCHE: Well, I think there are other reasons, too. One of the economic reasons is
                    that manufacturing was centered in Ontario, and it was also where the financial
                    interests were. The banks and insurance companies were headquartered in Ontario.
                    This was the heart of British Canada, and the big money was in Ontario, at least
                    the headquarters. The headquarters of Bell Canada was across the street from the
                    Consulate General. The Canadian companies welcomed capital from the U.S., but
                    they preferred loans rather than equity investments. American companies were so
                    much larger and better capitalized, and often took over Canadian companies and
                    made them American subsidiaries. They had previously been independent, but ended
                    up as a medium-sized subsidiary of an American corporation. I think there were
                    other reasons for the recrudescence of nationalistic emotions. The fact that
                    Ontario was such a predominantly English-speaking province meant they could
                    understand the nuances of what the Americans were saying or not saying.
                    Sometimes the fact that the Americans across the border did not say anything
                    about Canada and simply ignored its presence may have hurt as much as actual
                    criticism. Ontario, and particularly Toronto, was the center of the
                    anti-American sentiments.</p>
                <p>There was a differentiation, however, regarding the feelings toward the U.S.
                    between the “old Canadians” and the “new Canadians (those who immigrated after
                    WW II). The new Canadians had come from Eastern and Southern Europe and were
                    very active in their ethnic associations, strongly anti-Communist, and favorably
                    disposed toward the United States. We were seen as the liberator of Europe, the
                    bulwark against Communism, the great leader of the Western world. The Consul
                    General often would receive invitations to participate in the Latvian, Estonian,
                    Lithuanian independence day celebrations, or the 200th anniversary of
                    such-and-such a battle in Poland, Hungary, or Yugoslavia. Memminger had a
                    standing order for his secretary to regret for him, but to pass the invitation
                    to Jim Marshall or me. He joked that we were both bachelors and might meet a
                    nice, attractive Croatian, Latvian, Polish or Macedonian at one of the
                    celebrations. Whoever went in the place of the CG would always be called upon to
                    speak a few words. We were often the fourth or fifth on the roster of speakers
                    and well-wishers. We had a set speech. It was along the lines that the United
                    States has long been a strong supporter of name the country. Our Congress has
                    recently passed a resolution in behalf of name the country. Read the resolution.
                    Offer congratulations for whatever the occasion was and end with a rousing,
                    “Long live Latvia (or whatever)!” My horror was that I would at some time say
                    the wrong country, so I carried a three-by-five card with “This is your host”,
                    “This is the occasion”, and “This is the country.” Fortunately, I did not make
                    that error.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>BUCHE: I met young women from Latvia, Estonia, Poland, and from all over Eastern
                    Europe. I mentioned in passing one day to Bob Memminger that I had just met a
                    young woman from Estonia at one of the celebrations and was somewhat interested
                    in her. Bob looked at me and said, “You know, of course, you will have to resign
                    from the Foreign Service if you marry her.” I looked at him incredulously. He
                    said, “Didn't they tell you in the A-100 course that if you married a foreign
                    national you had to resign. The Department could either accept your resignation
                    or not depending on how the security clearance came out? As far as I know, John,
                    the Department is not going to allow you to marry anyone from the Soviet Union
                    and probably not anyone from Eastern Europe, either. Can't you see the blackmail
                    possibilities?” I said, “Oh, my God!” He said, “Well, I just wanted to let you
                    know before you get too serious with her or any other foreign woman.
                    Fortunately, we had just recently met, so we remained just good friends.</p>
                <p>Q: You were there 1960-62. Was there a comparable interest in Canada as in the
                    United States to the election of Kennedy and the young couple taking over?</p>
                <p>BUCHE: He probably would have gotten a majority in Canada, too, at least in
                    Ontario, where polls showed that he was quite popular. Despite Kennedy's
                    popularity, there was heavy criticism of our policy toward Castro and a lot of
                    gloating on the part of the Canadians regarding the differences in our two
                    approaches to the Castro regime.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Bay of Pigs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: That, yes, but even before the Bay of Pigs, there was delight on the part
                    of the Canadians on how Castro was tweaking the nose of the United States. The
                    Canadians took delight in describing the terrible conditions of Cuba in the
                    1940s and 1950s, the gambling, the prostitution, the corruption, the terrible
                    health conditions, and the huge gap between the elite and the peasants. They
                    were cheering Castro because he was targeting American investments and was
                    careful not to do very much against Canadian interests. Then came the Bay of
                    Pigs, and the Canadians could really gloat over an American humiliation.</p>
                <p>There was also a cultural issue involving our China policy that caused the
                    Canadians to ridicule the U.S. When the Beijing Opera Company came to Ontario,
                    we were ordered by the Department to publicize the fact that it was breaking
                    American law if an American purchased a ticket to the Beijing Opera, because we
                    had the boycott against China. Some Americans who were interested in the Beijing
                    Opera ignored the notice, and some attended just to show their opposition to the
                    boycott. Of course, the Canadians made a big thing about the Opera and packed
                    the halls. They thought our China boycott was short-sighted and stupid, but what
                    angered them was the U.S. Government's attempts to enforce our laws
                    extraterritorially by preventing Americans in Canada from going to a cultural
                    performance there. These were really irritants in American-Canadian relations,
                    and almost daily something new would come up.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>Q: You were in a place, where at one level, things were going well, but at
                    another level, at whatever would pass for the intelligentsia, I would assume
                    that they were definitely not pro-American.</p>
                <p>BUCHE: No, they definitely were not. They recognized some great accomplishments
                    that had been done. The intelligentsia recognized and admired much of our
                    literature and music, our inventions and scientific discoveries, our efforts in
                    the two World Wars, Presidents Lincoln and FDR, but there were so many aspects
                    of the United States they just could not stand. I do not know whether they spent
                    much effort in analyzing exactly what they disliked about us and the reasons
                    why. I suppose many accepted it as a given. If you were a native-born Canadian
                    and considered yourself an intellectual, it was de rigueur to be critical of the
                    U.S. The Canadian intellectuals whom I met were apparently able to
                    compartmentalize their feelings against the United States without antagonism
                    against individual Americans. I detected no personal enmity toward me, but
                    rather an open and welcoming attitude. They were able to distinguish between the
                    person and the Government I represented. My posting to Toronto was interesting
                    more for the political and economic work I did outside the office than the visa
                    and passport tasks performed within.</p>
                <p>In my second year of Toronto, I began to think about my next assignment. I was
                    influenced by the frequent messages from the Department pleading that if an
                    officer volunteers for Africa or for African-language training, he or she will
                    be given priority consideration. I told Bob Memminger about my interest in
                    learning an African language and a posting in Africa. He advised me to learn
                    French and to think long and hard about requesting hard language training for
                    Africa. “Don't waste your time on one of those languages you can't use anywhere
                    else in the world.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like Twi or Fang.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>BUCHE: He insisted that I request training in a language that would serve me
                    well. I agreed and said I would probably ask for French training. I had already
                    started studying French on my own. Not only was I interested in Africa, but also
                    in the Middle East, Turkey, and Iran. I went back and forth in my number one
                    preference. I was attracted to the idea of learning a hard language, but did not
                    want a language with limited use, unless that country was of strategic
                    importance to the U.S. Arabic, Turkish, Greek, and Persian met my criteria. Of
                    the African languages, Swahili seemed the only one to fit my set of conditions.
                    I asked Bill Eilers, the Commercial Officer at the Consulate, for his advice.
                    Bill told me there were plenty of Mideast specialists in the Department who
                    studied Arabic. He also said the Middle East was a tough area to serve in. He
                    suggested I focus on Iran and learn Persian, since there were not many officers
                    who knew the language or the area. I knew it was a key country in a strategic
                    region. I sent in my request for hard-language training with Persian at the top
                    of the list. Since I had to submit several alternates, I added Greek, Turkish,
                    and Swahili. Within a few weeks, I was told I had been selected to study Persian
                    beginning in January of 1962. I was just delighted. I drove down to Washington
                    to check out apartments. I decided I would live in the same building where the
                    FSI language classes were held, Arlington Towers. I would be in Washington one
                    year before going to Iran. I bought a dozen books about Iran. Psychologically, I
                    was beginning to phase out of Toronto and Ontario and concentrating on my next
                    post. I learned this is a tendency in the Foreign Service</p>
                <p>Since the consulate closed at Christmas, I went back home to West Lafayette,
                    Indiana. My family was supportive, as always, of my decision to study Persian
                    and spend the next three years in Iran. The prospects were very exciting for me,
                    so I did not pick up the nuanced reaction of my parents who were hoping I might
                    be posted somewhere closer and safer. I returned to Toronto to pack up and
                    depart post for Washington. There was a message waiting for me at the Consulate
                    saying that I was to study Amharic instead of Persian. My first reaction was,
                    “My God, Personnel strikes again”! I called PER/Training and asked what was
                    going on. The reply was circuitous and involved transfers, an illness, a shift
                    of priorities, and other factors. The net result was that I was to study
                    Amharic. The training officer assured me it would be an excellent boost to my
                    career.</p>

                    I was to report to the Embassy at Addis Ababa in late January 1963.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find learning Amharic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: I found it difficult. Amharic is a member of the Semitic language family.
                    It was the first non-Western I had studied. I had to suspend almost all the
                    rules or paradigms I had learned in studying Greek, Latin, German, and French.
                    Also there were sounds in Amharic that were particularly difficult for me to
                    replicate. We had three Ethiopian graduate students, who were picking up some
                    extra money by working as the native speakers. Our linguist, Professor
                    Obolensky, was a Semitic language scholar, but admitted on the first day of
                    class that he did not know much Amharic. He said, “I'm a Semitic language
                    linguist. Amharic is a Semitic language, and I understand its structure. I will
                    use the native speakers in such a way that you will learn the correct accent and
                    use of the language.” He was able to help us correct our mispronunciations and
                    help us in so many ways. I was not accustomed to the Foreign Service Institute's
                    language teaching method, namely a heavily oral approach, stressing repetition
                    of memorized sentences or dialogues. I was accustomed to the reading approach,
                    where I learned vocabulary, declensions, conjugations, and rules of grammar. We
                    started the first day with simple phrases, constantly repeating after the native
                    Amharic speakers. I wanted a text before me so I could “see” what I was trying
                    to say. I also wanted to have explanations of how the words fit together
                    grammatically. We had a phonetic text, but it was not in the Amharic script. It
                    was just a peculiar mixture of Roman-alphabet symbols. We memorized sentences;
                    then we memorized simple conversations. I, of course, went along with what the
                    class was asked to do, but I was convinced I could learn faster with a
                    combination of the FSI method and my traditional manner. Dr. Obolensky counseled
                    patience and trust and assured me that the missing elements would be addressed
                    in a few months. Now my task was to do my best to imitate the Ethiopians without
                    thinking of grammar rules or gender and case agreements. “Be like a child and
                    mimic the teachers.”</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>I was the only person of the four in the class who seemed to have mental block
                    against the method, although I was probably the most determined to learn the
                    language. There were two officers from the Department of Defense who were going
                    to Addis Ababa as attach�s. They were to study Amharic in Washington for about
                    two months, just to get started and then continue at post. The other person in
                    the class was a first-tour FSO, Bill Womack. He was a natural linguist. I was
                    uncomfortable at first that he was so quick to pick up the language. Bill
                    understood the language so much better and faster than I did. At St. Meinrad and
                    at Purdue, I had always been the best student in the language classes. I, of
                    course, realized it was better for me that someone was ahead of me rather than
                    holding me back. I was determined to keep up with Bill, so spent more and more
                    time at night and on the weekends studying the language. I was a bachelor with
                    no Foreign Service responsibilities other than learning Amharic. I was concerned
                    also that I not hold him back. Bill was scheduled to remain only six months in
                    class, the maximum time allowed for language courses for Junior Officers. When
                    Bill left, he had reached the FSI's goal for a full-time hard language student:
                    speaking and reading at the 3 level (with 5 being native speaker). I then had
                    the three Ethiopian instructors to myself for the last five months. Thanks to
                    Bill's torrid pace, I was also ahead of the normal schedule. I began to ease
                    back a little on the weekends, especially since in September, I had met a
                    management intern at the Department and was very interested in her. During the
                    week, however, I pretty much maintained my schedule of eating dinner in my
                    apartment in Arlington Towers and then taking the elevator to the language labs
                    for an hour or so a review.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The classes were in the basement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: In the basement of Arlington Towers.</p>

                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>BUCHE: Although the classrooms and labs were not fancy, they were certainly
                    convenient for me. I could use the elevator, which meant no commuting. It also
                    meant that at lunch time I could go up to my apartment and have a sandwich and
                    just get a change of scenery for a half hour. Concentrating on just one subject
                    for an extended period was something I had wanted to do in my life - not
                    necessarily study Amharic, but to study one thing, whether it was mathematics,
                    history or a language. This was my opportunity to concentrate 100 percent on one
                    discipline. I really enjoyed it and was grateful the Department had chosen me to
                    study a hard language. As it turned out, learning Amharic not only was a career
                    boost for me, but the assignment to Addis Ababa led to lasting personal
                    friendships and professional developments that have greatly enriched my life.
                    Incidentally, I also scored S/3 and R/3 on the FSI Amharic test at the end of
                    the course. (That means I was able to speak and read at a minimum professional
                    level.) I think that was what PER had expected when I was selected for
                    hard-language training, partly as a result of my score on the MLAT taken during
                    the A-100 training and the fact that I had tested well in German..</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Modern Language Aptitude Test.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: After I took the MLAT, I did not think I had done very well.As I later
                    learned, I was in the top quartile.</p>
                <p>Q: Often in taking a language, you learn quite a bit about the society by your
                    interaction with your instructors. Were you getting anything from instructors
                    about Ethiopia?</p>
                <p>BUCHE: We did, and largely through observation and informal chats after class and
                    during breaks. There were no structured talks on Ethiopian culture, history, or
                    politics. They were there to help us learn how Ethiopians spoke Amharic. I
                    absorbed cultural practices and traits through close proximity with my
                    instructors over an eleven-month period. I did not realize how much I had
                    unconsciously taken in, until I was already in the country. In speaking or
                    interacting with Ethiopians, I caught myself reacting with body language similar
                    to Mulugeta, Debebe, or Alemayehu in analogous situations. What I learned about
                    Ethiopian history was from reading on the side. I was told many times, not only
                    by Professor Obolensky, but also by other FSI staff to learn about the history
                    and the politics of the country when I got there. I was in a language class, not
                    an area studies class.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: From January of 1963 until July of 1966. I finished Amharic class in
                    mid-December, spent some time with my family in Indiana, was married on December
                    29, 1962, spent our honeymoon en route, and arrived in Addis Ababa in
                    mid-January.</p>

                        youwife, and what was her background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: My wife, Anike, was a management intern at the State Department. I met her
                    through my roommate, Richard Kochan. He was a close friend of mine from the
                    Army, and he needed a room in Washington for two or three months. He shared my
                    apartment in Arlington Towers. Rich was working in the Personnel Section of the
                    Department, processing incoming Foreign Service officers, interns, political
                    ambassadors, et al. He was the key person for the initial paperwork. He helped
                    process Anike and enthusiastically described her to me. Anike Verhoeff was born
                    in Indonesia of Dutch parents. She spent the war years in a Japanese internment
                    camp with her mother and brother. Her father was in a POW camp. After the war,
                    they returned to the Netherlands, where her father worked as a physician with
                    KLM. The Verhoeff family then moved to Curacao and later immigrated to
                    Vancouver, Canada, before moving to North Carolina. She graduated from Duke,
                    spent a year in Europe, and came to Washington to work. Richard asked whether I
                    would like to meet Anike. I really was not sure, but replied affirmatively. I
                    warned him, however, I could meet with her only within a limited time because of
                    my classes. I did not want her to take up my weekends or interfere with my
                    evening tape labs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, heavens, no!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: So he arranged for me to telephone her around Labor Day. I met Anike and
                    was instantly impressed. We saw each other more and more frequently. Since I was
                    going to Ethiopia, we had to decide rather quickly about our future
                    relationship. Our Charge in Addis Ababa was in Washington on consultations in
                    November. He asked to see me. I asked whether I might bring Anike along. He
                    agreed. He and I spoke about my progress in Amharic and a little about the
                    situation in Ethiopia. Toward the end of the discussion, he asked whether I
                    planned to marry Anike. I told him I was not sure at that point. He jokingly
                    said that if I married her before going to Ethiopia, the Department would pay
                    her fare; otherwise she would have to buy her own ticket. Anike and I, however,
                    realized that a long-distance relationship would be nearly impossible to
                    maintain. We, therefore, decided to marry. It has been an extremely happy
                    marriage.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>BUCHE: Well, I had some ideas about what to expect, but was quite naive and
                    completely unprepared for other things. I had some short briefings by the Desk
                    Officer in December, but no African Area courses at the FSI. As I mentioned
                    earlier, I did some reading on my own, but I did not often go over to the Desk
                    to read cables and airgrams. Professor Obolensky and other staff members were
                    firmly opposed to taking time out from class, although other language trainees
                    would insist on taking off early on Friday afternoons to read in on their next
                    country of assignment. I think it was my monastic and military training. When
                    someone tells me this is what I am supposed to do, I do it. Also I was the only
                    student in class for about five months.</p>
                <p>When I got to Ethiopia, I really was not aware in any detail about the political
                    problems. I knew in general about the overarching role of the Emperor, the
                    wealth, influence, and conservatism of the Orthodox Church and the noble
                    families, the failed coup d'�tat and the aftermath, the unrest among the
                    students, the abject poverty, the urgent need for land reform, the stirrings of
                    Eritrean independence, and the potential effects in Ethiopia of the African
                    independence wave from reading and from stories after class by the
                    instructors.</p>
                <p>Of the three, the most astute observer and also the most critical of the regime
                    was Alemayehu Wondimagegnehu. He was an NCO in the Imperial Body Guard, and
                    served for years as the driver and an aide de camp in Korea and Ethiopia to the
                    Commanding General of the Bodyguard. He left the military in his mid-thirties to
                    study in the U.S. shortly before the December 1960 coup attempt. He was
                    personally very close to the general who had led the coup. Alemayehu wanted
                    fundamental changes in the way feudal Ethiopia was governed, so I had an early
                    taste of what turned out to be similar sentiments among the university students
                    and young military officers. The other two instructors were critical of the
                    regime, but were more inclined toward incremental reforms.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>I knew from reading about Ethiopia's gross national product, literacy rates,
                    infant mortality, miles of paved roads, kilowattage generated, and other
                    assorted statistics that Ethiopia was one of the poorest countries in the world.
                    When I arrived, however, I was stunned by the sight of the diseased and maimed
                    beggars, the open sewers, the dirty, overcrowded health clinics and hospitals,
                    the rags people wore as clothing, and the hovels where they lived. My reading
                    and discussions with my instructors had not fully prepared me for my first
                    experience in a third-world country. My first job at the Embassy was a temporary
                    assignment in the General Services Section for about a month, until I could get
                    my feet on the ground. Although we had met for an hour in Washington, the charg�
                    wanted to find out what he was dealing with, what I was like, and what I had to
                    offer. He was not going to put me into a sensitive position immediately. I was
                    happy to help out the GSO for a while and to learn a bit about how a-n embassy
                    works. I knew I was eventually going into the Political Section, but not sure
                    when. I made arrangements for Amharic lessons an hour a day, but I had many
                    opportunities to converse with Ethiopians in my work as the Assistant GSO. I was
                    so pleased at the way I could speak with them. The first time I spoke with an
                    Ethiopian in Amharic outside the FSI was on the Ethiopian Airlines plane. It was
                    just polite chatter. When Anike and I arrived in Addis Ababa, there was no one
                    to meet us at the airport from the Embassy because of a mix-up. I had to go
                    through Customs/Immigration with loaded suitcases and a new bride, who still had
                    her tourist passport in her maiden name and no visa. The conversation with the
                    Ethiopian officials followed fairly closely what I had learned in one of the
                    classroom exercises, Lesson X “What to do at the Customs and Immigration.” One
                    official asked me a question in Amharic. (In the early 1960s, very few
                    Ethiopians at such a level could speak English.) I answered back in Amharic. He
                    and the others were quite surprised, so they asked more questions in Amharic,
                    and I responded in that language. They were impressed and warmly welcomed us to
                    Ethiopia. Anike was very impressed.</p>

                    ambassador was to be Edward Korry, but he did not arrive until April of 1963.
                    Sheldon Vance went from Ethiopia to become Ambassador to Chad and then to the
                    Congo. He then became the Department's Coordinator for International Narcotics
                    Control. I am not sure what the exact title was then.</p>

                <p>BUCHE: The Emperor had survived the 1960 coup, and there was a slightly faster
                    pace of reform. The coup was still on peoples' minds, although it took place in
                    December 1960, and the last executions were completed by mid-1961. It was a
                    bloody coup, and there were deaths on both sides, not only from the fighting,
                    but also the killing of hostages by the Revolutionaries and then the executions
                    by the Government. The coup punctured the mystique surrounding the Emperor,
                    damaged the relations between Haile Selassie and his son, the Crown Prince,
                    revealed the bitter rivalries in the military and security forces, demonstrated
                    the extent of hatred toward the reactionary nobles around the Emperor, and
                    inspired other opponents of the regime to continue their fight. A pesky
                    insurgency was festering in Eritrea. The common wisdom in Addis Ababa was that
                    the insurgency was not going to amount to very much, because how were the
                    Eritrean guerillas going to stand up to the Imperial Army? The rebellion did not
                    have to happen. Haile Selassie made a strategic miscalculation. After WWII,
                    there were years of discussion at the UN on what to do about the former Italian
                    colony of Eritrea. Italy was our ally, so we and the Brits were willing to
                    listen to what that country advocated. On the other hand, Ethiopia had been
                    abandoned and betrayed in her time of desperate need by the West (with the
                    exception of the U.S.) The UN had to grapple with the hard question of what to
                    do with Eritrea: independence, complete amalgamation with Ethiopia, or a
                    federation with Ethiopia. Haile Selassie wanted complete amalgamation, but he
                    saw that proposal was not going to fly. He was absolutely opposed to
                    independence, so he accepted federation. In 1951, the Federation came into
                    being. From the beginning, the Emperor and the Ethiopians, with the support of
                    some influential Eritreans, set about to destroy the Federation. The means were
                    classic: threats, intimidation, bribery, flattery, loans, gifts, assassinations,
                    marriages, awards, etc. By 1961, Haile Selassie had the Eritrean Parliament
                    under his control. He gave the signal and the Eritrean Parliament voted to
                    abolish the Federation and join “Motherland Ethiopia”. The rebellion began a few
                    months later.</p>
                <p>While there was intense interest within the Palace and in several Government
                    ministries about the momentous changes in Africa, the man in the street looked
                    down on the dark-skinned Africans and did not want anything to do with them. The
                    Emperor had the foresight to use the burgeoning African independence movements
                    for the benefit of Ethiopia. He had decided that if there was going to be a
                    large number of newly-independent African states, he was the only logical choice
                    for the role of the Continent's “father figure”. So he laid the groundwork for
                    an organization (to be sited in Addis Ababa) to serve the new Africa. His vision
                    created the Organization of African Unity. How did he bring it off? For years he
                    had supported independence movements, not with large sums of money or arms
                    shipments, but by personal contacts with the various leaders. Many, while still
                    engaged in the struggle for independence, had been invited by the Emperor to
                    visit him in Addis Ababa. The Emperor feted them lavishly and bestowed generous
                    gifts on them. They would leave Ethiopia, pleased with the Emperor's recognition
                    and generosity. The Emperor sent the draft OAU charter to the leaders of
                    independent African states and invited them to meet in Addis Ababa in May 1963
                    to sign the document. They came, and after several days of oratory and
                    festivities, signed the Charter.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>I had been alerted by conversations with my instructors to an antagonism between
                    the younger, educated officials in the Government and the traditionalists in the
                    senior Government positions and at the Court. Most of the college-educated
                    people in Ethiopia at that time had been selected or approved by the Emperor.
                    Many had studied abroad, since the national university (Haile Selassie I
                    University) was just developing. All the grads with higher degrees had to study
                    abroad, since there were no post-graduate degrees awarded at HSIU until around
                    1964. He chose prospective students largely on the basis of grades and
                    performance in high school. A high percentage was from the low and middle class.
                    The Emperor did not favor the sons and daughters of the nobility. He probably
                    envisaged the hundreds of future university grads as a long-term counterweight
                    to the nobility. The Emperor made it clear to the students that he was choosing
                    them to play an important role in Ethiopian Government and society. The Emperor
                    spent considerable time on education and took a personal interest in it.</p>
                <p>The 1960 coup had wide support among the college students, not only the
                    undergrads in Addis Ababa, but many of the graduates who had benefitted from
                    going abroad and studying under Haile Selassie's patronage. Many of the latter
                    came back with ideas and hopes that clashed with what they were experiencing:
                    poverty, injustice, favoritism, in brief, a traditional, semi-feudal
                    aristocracy. They had been introduced to democracy, either experiencing it
                    abroad or reading about it in classrooms in Ethiopia. There was a Parliament of
                    two chambers that was created by the Constitution, which was given to the people
                    by Haile Selassie. So Parliament was created, and the first parliamentary
                    elections for the Lower House were held. The Senate was appointed by the
                    Emperor. Political parties were not allowed, and candidates had to stand as
                    individuals. It was pretty much a Parliament of landed interests, as one would
                    expect. There were a few exceptions, namely schoolteachers, small businessmen,
                    and minor officials who somehow got elected. They were not opponents of the
                    regime, but on the other hand, they were not subservient to the landowning class
                    or the Orthodox Church. While the Parliament was under the control of the
                    Emperor regarding what legislation it could enact, there were opportunities for
                    the members to criticize (obliquely and gently) actions of the Government, as
                    long as there was no direct mention of the Emperor, the Ministers, or
                    influential persons. Amharic is quite subtle and flexible, with double and
                    triple meanings to words, so a clever, but careful person could criticize
                    without too much concern about going to prison.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>To go back to your question how did I find things. The university was a sort of
                    “warm-bed” of rebellion. Americans were looked upon as the supporters of the
                    status quo, which we were and were not. Internally, we were in favor of progress
                    and development; externally, we wanted the Ethiopians to be strong enough to
                    defend against Somali irredentism. We were beginning to bring in more weapons
                    for the military to oppose Somali attacks in the Ogaden. The USG wanted to
                    expand the base in Asmara, Kagnew Station, which was a key monitoring and
                    communications station. We did not pay much rent. I think we paid only $100,000
                    a year, which was the actual going rental price for the land. The real “price”
                    for Kagnew was in economic and military aid. The fact that the U.S. military was
                    at Kagnew infuriated many students. They were attuned to the anti-colonialist
                    rhetoric of the African independence movements and looked upon Kagnew as
                    symbolic of our manipulation and interference in Africa. They also saw Kagnew as
                    the guarantee of our support for the Emperor. So all these things were festering
                    in Ethiopia when I arrived.</p>
                <p>I forgot to mention there were also non-Somali ethnic groups in Ethiopia who were
                    very unhappy with the way they were treated by the Government. It did not start
                    with Haile Selassie, but by his immediate predecessors who conquered the people
                    beyond the Amhara heartland, took their land, and imposed the imperial system on
                    them. The conquered people were from various ethnic groups, but the Amharas
                    often lumped them together under the pejorative term of “Galla.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the darker people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: They were sometimes darker than the Amharas or Tigreans who comprised the
                    ruling elite of Ethiopia. The “Galla” were Hamitic people. They spoke languages
                    which were from a different linguistic family than the Semitic languages of
                    Amharic or Tigrinya. They had not been converted to Christianity until after
                    they were conquered. They were either Muslim or animist. These were conquered
                    peoples, although the Emperors tried to sweeten the situation somewhat by
                    inviting the traditional chiefs to become Christian and marry Amharas. Haile
                    Selassie played the game as well as his predecessors. He would throw a
                    rebellious chief into prison, and then arrange for an Amhara woman, often from
                    the nobility, to marry the chief's son. The son would be expected to become
                    Christian, learn Amharic, and transfer his loyalty to the Imperial Crown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went into the Political Section, what were we
                        lookinat? How did you operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>BUCHE: Since I could speak Amharic, I was assigned by Sheldon Vance to reporting
                    on Ethiopia's internal developments. My beat was the Parliament, what was
                    happening in the provinces, the university, and the “young elite.” Bob Wenzel
                    arrived as the new Political Counselor, and Don Junior came in to take charge of
                    reporting on the OAU and African issues. After his arrival, Ambassador Edward
                    Korry reviewed what the Embassy officers were doing and made changes in
                    priorities. He realized from his briefings in Washington that we knew little of
                    what was going on Ethiopia outside of Addis Ababa and Asmara. With me he
                    emphasized more travel to the provinces. “That is your bailiwick. You are to
                    travel anywhere in Ethiopia, and I want you out of the Embassy for a minimum of
                    one week every month. We will make money available to you for transportation.
                    Take Embassy jeeps, an Ethiopian Airlines plane, or go along a team from our
                    Military Advisory Assistance Group, the MAAG. When military training teams come
                    from the U.S., go along with them.” I was delighted with the order to do more
                    travel to the provinces. I found provincial travel was personally fascinating
                    and politically productive. The rest of the political section did the
                    traditional work of bilateral relations and reporting on Ethiopia's relations
                    with the rest of the world. There was a CIA station with three officers. We had
                    many political issues: OAU, UN, Kagnew and military assistance, insurgencies,
                    domestic opposition, etc. With the founding of the OAU and the upgrading and
                    expansion of the UN Economic Commission for Africa, Embassy Addis Ababa took on
                    additional responsibilities. Ethiopia was becoming more important in
                    Washington's eyes. We were making a political commitment to Ethiopia with
                    military training and weapons and increased economic assistance. The Somali
                    insurgency was active and was getting a lot of attention. Its aims, source of
                    support, and the stakes involved were fairly obvious. On the other hand, the
                    nascent insurgency in Eritrea by the Eritrean Liberation Force (ELF) was not so
                    clear to us regarding the depth of its support among the populace, the
                    effectiveness of the Government's counter-insurgency measures, the staying power
                    of the ELF, and what it meant to Kagnew. In January 1963, when I arrived, we
                    were focusing primarily on the Ogaden, not Eritrea. We did not recognize at the
                    time the deep intensity in Eritrea of the anti-Amhara, anti-central-government
                    feeling. Our post in Asmara was not staffed to do in-depth political reporting
                    throughout the province on Eritrean attitudes, developments, and leadership. The
                    Consulate General had heavy obligations toward Kagnew, serving the base's public
                    affairs needs, plus providing political guidance and consular services.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably to service the military.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Consular services for the military at Kagnew Station.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>BUCHE: Yes, that was one of the Consulate's duties. The new ambassador changed
                    priorities for the Consulate, too. He was told in Washington that Kagnew Station
                    was one of our most important overseas strategic assets. He agreed that what the
                    Consulate General was doing regarding services to Kagnew should be continued,
                    but he insisted that it was critical to learn more about what was happening
                    outside the Government offices in Asmara. Ambassador Korry was not a career
                    ambassador. He came out of journalism. He was with UPI and then with Cowles
                    Publications, before being asked to become Ambassador to Ethiopia. What he saw
                    in Ethiopia was a country of extraordinary potential and an immense potential
                    for things to go wrong. He believed one of his major tasks was to make sure that
                    Washington comprehended Ethiopia's problems and potential as these elements
                    affected American interests and to devote the necessary resources to working out
                    possible solutions. I know early on in his posting, Korry saw major disconnects
                    between Washington's professed doctrine of the acknowledgment of Kagnew's
                    short-to-medium-term and Ethiopia's long-term strategic importance to the USG
                    and the resources our Government was willing to make available to the country.
                    Kagnew's vital importance was the key focus in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was an article of faith, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>BUCHE: It was an article of faith; it really was; and we were putting enormous
                    amounts of equipment into Kagnew. We were monitoring the Soviet space shots and
                    their development of rocketry and satellites. We had some assets in Iran and
                    elsewhere for this purpose, but because of geography, Kagnew was of strategic
                    importance. Kagnew Station also was electronically monitoring what was happening
                    diplomatically and militarily throughout the Middle East. Kagnew was also a
                    relay station for diplomatic and military communications for the USG. It was one
                    of our primary stations for communicating with our submarines and strategic
                    bombers in the Indian Ocean. It was an article of faith that Kagnew was
                    strategic, and we had to defend it. The Emperor had to be on board if we were to
                    maintain Kagnew. He was under pressure regarding Kagnew from some of his own
                    advisers and Ministers, but also from the other Africans and the leaders of the
                    Non-aligned Movement, the G-77, who were pushing for a neutral, non-aligned
                    Africa. There were many resolutions on African non-alignment in the UN and the
                    OAU. The Emperor finessed them. The Emperor or his representatives would say,
                    “Yes, we should work for a neutral, non-aligned Africa. Ethiopia is neutral and
                    non-aligned. We have no foreign bases on our soil. Kagnew is not a foreign base,
                    since there are no heavy weapons or military aircraft there. Kagnew is only a
                    communications station.” We were concerned that the ELF might decide to blow up
                    some of our antennas. There were antenna towers scattered over hundreds of
                    acres. They were guarded by local contract guards and were surrounded by a
                    Cyclone fence. We knew the antenna fields were extremely vulnerable, and could
                    be blown up by a determined group of soldiers. As the clashes between the
                    Ethiopian military and the Eritrean insurgents became more frequent and
                    bloodier, we were concerned how the struggle would impact on Kagnew. There were
                    over 4,000 Americans there. I think there were about 1,200 to 1,500 uniformed,
                    mostly Army Security Agency personnel, but also small contingents of
                    communications and intelligence units from the Air Force and Navy. There were
                    also large numbers of American civilian employees working for various U.S.
                    intelligence agencies. There were probably a thousand dependents. Some of the
                    families were living in Asmara, in rented houses. They were “on the economy”.
                    These were just a few of the issues confronting our new Ambassador.</p>
                <p>We were curious how ordinary Ethiopians would react to the increasing numbers of
                    African diplomats and officials coming to Addis Ababa in connection with the OAU
                    and ECA. The ingrained Ethiopian politeness and hospitality toward guests
                    overcame their cultural antipathy against dark-skinned people. They swallowed
                    their cultural prejudices and treated the Africans with respect. What their
                    thoughts may have been when the Africans badly misbehaved in public is another
                    question. Many of the Africans in the numerous delegations or new embassies in
                    1963-66 had suddenly gone from being students or clerks to being ambassadors,
                    junior ministers, and the like. When they came to Addis Ababa, there were
                    Ethiopian officials to open doors, limos with chauffeur at their disposal, easy
                    access to booze and women, and attention from journalists and diplomats. It was
                    a heady time for the newly-independent Africans, and more than a few disgraced
                    themselves and their country with their public antics.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>Q: Well, did you find in your reporting that you had to keep in mind that you had
                    a very pro-African bureau, G. Mennen Williams and his deputy, Wayne
                    Fredericks.</p>
                <p>BUCHE: Very definitely yes.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, and also that this was not a Bureau at the top that wanted to hear about
                    antics; it wanted to hear about very serious things, and probably much more was
                    expected from the Africans than actually the Africans were being able to deliver
                    at that time.</p>
                <p>BUCHE: Yes, the antics never found their way into the Embassy reporting. We had
                    enough sense not to report the disgusting public behavior of some of the
                    Africans. Our reports were timely, accurate, substantive, really high quality. I
                    did not write them because I did not report on the OAU or the ECA. Don Junior
                    was responsible for OAU issues; Art Stillman covered the ECA. When there was an
                    important OAU or ECA conference, and there were many of the former in the first
                    several years, the entire Embassy got involved. Ambassador Korry did much of the
                    spot reporting, folding our bits and pieces into what he had picked up from the
                    principals involved. He was an experienced, resourceful, competitive, and
                    effective reporter by profession. He brought these traits with him to Addis
                    Ababa. Korry wanted to be the first into Washington and our embassies with
                    reports on important developments from the OAU and ECA conferences.
                    (Developments in the former were much more important and time-sensitive than the
                    latter.) He wanted Soapy Williams and Wayne Fredericks, plus our embassies, to
                    hear from him first before they saw the results on the news tickers or had
                    read-outs from interested governments. Korry regarded the BBC, Reuters, AP, and
                    Agence France Presse as colleagues and competitors. He knew the top reporters
                    and had excellent rapport with them. They had useful contacts among the African
                    delegations from the capitals and were willing to trade information with Korry.
                    Being the American Ambassador, but more than that, being Edward Korry, meant
                    that he quickly established effective relations with the key Ethiopians. The OAU
                    sessions were closed to the public, including diplomats and journalists, but
                    Korry and his Embassy team learned from various sources what was happening
                    inside. I met a French interpreter through Anike, who proved to be an excellent
                    source. As soon as a session was over, Korry and team would confer with our
                    contacts and then rush back to the Embassy. Korry would sit down at a typewriter
                    and type the report on the green telegram form. He would hand the finished
                    product to Sheldon, Bob Wenzel, or Don Junior to read in case he had forgotten
                    something, and then give it to the Communications Officer to transmit. This was
                    often at midnight or later. When the Department of State and our embassies
                    opened the next day, Ed Korry's cable was in the take. While I enjoyed assisting
                    with the OAU conferences, my primary task was internal Ethiopian reporting.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, I thought we might stop at this point. We will pick it up again while
                    you are in Ethiopia. You have talked about Kagnew Station, the general political
                    situation in Ethiopia, the Emperor, and Ed Korry. I'd like to ask you what you
                    were finding out and how you operated as the internal political officer,
                    traveling around the country. Let's pick that up the next time.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>***Today is the 17th of August, 1999. All right, let's start. You were there in
                    Ethiopia from when to when?</p>
                <p>BUCHE: I arrived in January of 1963 and left in July of 1966.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get around as a political officer? The Emperor
                        wathe name of the game at that time, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Right, everything was highly centralized around the Emperor. Issues or
                    questions were routinely taken to him for resolution. He held court every
                    morning when he received ministers, governors, judges, generals, and ordinary
                    citizens. This was also the time when he summoned persons to reward, punish,
                    warn, praise, assign, transfer, or retire. He seemed to prefer the face-to-face
                    approach rather than through memos. The provincial governors and also the
                    district governors came to Addis Ababa from time to time to communicate with His
                    Imperial Majesty. He appointed them, so they were responsible to him. In their
                    areas, they conveyed the Emperor's will to the police, the judges, the
                    administrators, and the public and were responsible for seeing that his will was
                    carried out.</p>
                <p>And following up on where we left it last time, how did I get around and what did
                    I do? I had the responsibility from the Ambassador to learn and report on what
                    was happening internally in Ethiopia. There was practically no media coverage of
                    the provinces other than PR for the Government. We had few sources of
                    information on what was happening or likely to happen in the provinces. Our
                    intelligence people or the MAAG would sometimes pick up information about the
                    Eritrean or Ogaden insurgencies, but this was usually about skirmishes,
                    ambushes, casualties, and other conflict-related information. I do not recall
                    ever reading any CIA reports on causes of the discontent in the provinces, where
                    land was taken illegally by the governors, judgments were handed down in civil
                    and criminal cases and licenses and concessions awarded or withdrawn on the
                    basis of bribes or at the direction of the governor, or persons arrested and
                    detained according to the desire of the police chief or governor. We had a good
                    handle on what the Ethiopians were doing on the international scene, but were in
                    the dark internally. I drew up a plan of where I wanted to go, when, why, and
                    how. Bob Wenzel, Sheldon, and the Ambassador reviewed it, made suggestions, and
                    approved. In addition to the means of transportation I mentioned earlier, we
                    also had a U.S. Army Mapping Mission. There was a military officer in charge,
                    and a mixture of military and civilians under him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there is an Army Mapping Service, which is really
                        quitcivilian, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>BUCHE: The Mapping Service had helicopters. There was, of course, the Ethiopian
                    Airlines, which had DC-3's which could fly all over the country. The Embassy and
                    AID Mission had Land Rovers and Jeeps, so I had a wide range of transport
                    options. On one occasion, I was met at a grassy landing field in Gojjam Province
                    by mules and guards dispatched by the district governor to transport me the last
                    few miles. (It was too muddy for a Land Rover.) I made a special effort to
                    contact Peace Corps Volunteers and American missionaries when I was in the area.
                    The PCVs were not supposed to be used by Embassy officers for intelligence
                    gathering. I agreed with that prohibition and certainly did not pressure any of
                    the Volunteers to tell me anything of a sensitive nature. When I visited with
                    them, I usually sat and listened to what they wanted to tell me of their own
                    volition. They would tell about the corrupt police chief, or how the governor
                    took land away from so and so on false charges and how the judges were bribed or
                    ordered to render a verdict. They knew what was going on in the town and
                    surrounding area and were delighted that someone from the American Embassy was
                    interested in hearing their views. The missionaries were an excellent source of
                    information. They knew the local officials and languages. They were not allowed
                    to proselytize in the Christian regions (Amhara/Tigre areas), so they went into
                    the peripheral lands where Islam and/or animism were the predominant religions.
                    These were the areas of the greatest exploitation by the Amhara/Tigre
                    conquerors. Many had lived in a mission station for years. An American Lutheran
                    missionary, Reverend Don McClure, had been born at the station, grew up there,
                    and succeeded his father as pastor. I found that the missionaries with their
                    long residence in an area tended to put things into perspective...things are bad
                    now, but they were worse in the mid-1950s, or the current governor is the most
                    capable man we have seen since our arrival in 1948, or similar comparisons.
                    Sometimes I would have introductions from students or officials in Addis Ababa.
                    I made a special effort to meet the university students. I invited small groups
                    to our apartment. We lived opposite the main campus of the University. Twice a
                    month we had open house and several dozen students would come over for beer and
                    popcorn, and the local food, wat and injera. I would mention I was planning a
                    trip to a district and ask whether anyone was from there. Fairly often one or
                    two of the students were from that area. I would ask whether they wanted me to
                    take anything to their family, and the answer was usually affirmative. I
                    delivered parcels and usually was asked by the family to carry back something
                    for the student. I enjoyed meeting the families of the students. They ranged
                    from governors to peasants. On my return to Addis Ababa, I would relate some of
                    my impressions to the student whose family I had visited to see his or her
                    reactions. Before each trip, I had to obtain written authorization from the
                    Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Interior. The latter would
                    inform the provincial governor and the district governor of my visit. Without
                    the impressive-looking authorization paper with its seals and stamps from Addis
                    Ababa, I could not have met with any local official. Also there would have been
                    difficulties from the police for the Peace Corps Volunteers or missionaries with
                    whom I met. I was often surprised to find how much the top officials were
                    willing to tell me about the local problems. They were quite forthcoming in
                    describing events and conditions. Where they and the PCVs and missionaries often
                    diverged was in describing the causes or sources of the problems. The younger
                    officials, schoolteachers, and National Service Volunteers (from HSI University)
                    turned out to be excellent sources of information. Their views and goals were in
                    opposition to the higher ups. The National Service Volunteers were the most
                    critical. For the most part, they were in the provinces against their will. The
                    National Service was created in 1964, and one year of service in the provinces
                    was made a condition for graduating from the University. They were critical of
                    the regime while in the university, but their demonstrations and oratory in
                    favor of land and tax reform probably had limited effect in the capital. In the
                    provinces, they saw up close what was happening and used their positions as
                    teachers, health workers, engineers, et al to spread their views among their
                    secondary-school students and coworkers.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now let's take a city out in the hinterland somewhere in
                        Tigre.You arrive. Do they know you are coming?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>BUCHE: Yes, let's take one of my visits to Makeli, the capital of Tigre. Ras
                    Mengesha Seyoum, the Governor (and married to a granddaughter of the Emperor),
                    would be told, by telephone or by radio, that John Buche from the American
                    Embassy will arrive by plane or by road on a certain day for a visit of a week,
                    and please give him all appropriate courtesies. I would often be received by a
                    representative of the Governor, taken to the Governor's Office where I would
                    meet him (if he were in town) and then introduced to the police chief, the army
                    commander, the top officials in health, education, public works,
                    telecommunications, and other ministries. On one occasion, I was invited to
                    dinner by the Governor; on the second visit I was invited to dinner by another
                    senior official. I would usually be escorted by a police or military officer
                    when I traveled outside the town. Since I knew Amharic, I did not have an
                    interpreter. I never had an interpreter. This was such an advantage,
                    particularly in the provinces, where not many people spoke English in the early
                    1960s. Even in Tigre, where the mother tongue was Tigrinya, the officials had to
                    know Amharic. Although I suspected my movements were monitored, I could call on
                    local officials as I pleased. Sometimes we met along with their staff and
                    sometimes alone. Spending a week in Tigre or in another province observing and
                    conversing gave me an impression of the officials, the politics, the problems,
                    and the potential of the area. I was not trying to be a junior CIA agent by
                    calling on people at midnight asking what is the real scoop. Just by talking to
                    a wide variety of local people, I could piece together enough to draw some
                    conclusions. I believe my travels and reporting helped our Ambassador and
                    policy-makers in Washington to understand with greater depth and more
                    specificity what was happening outside of Addis Ababa and Asmara. My reporting
                    was not much different than what most outside observers and analysts felt
                    instinctively regarding the Imperial Ethiopian Government's administration in
                    the provinces. I provided multiple and specific examples of the corruption,
                    human rights abuses, and exploitation by the Government officials and the power
                    structure (usually Amharas or Amharacized locals). I highlighted instances where
                    officials and local notables seemed to be doing their jobs in a responsible
                    manner. I reported local history, how and why certain events occurred, how
                    certain families gained or lost power, why there were unusual ethnic mixtures,
                    what was taking place on the economic development side, how a new all-weather
                    road was changing the dynamics of an area. I also reported on some armed
                    clashes, raids, and uprisings which had occurred from a year to a few weeks
                    before my visit to the local scene. We were aware of some of these events (from
                    electronic monitoring from Kagnew and from the CIA, MAAG, and AID), but not many
                    details or the causes. Some of my reporting covered areas or fields which
                    journalists, academicians, or government offices should have published, but had
                    not done so at that time. My reports named names, so we also expanded our
                    biographic files considerably.) My work helped us understand the complexities
                    and fragility of provincial Ethiopia a little bit better. In some cases the
                    situation was better than we had imagined; in others it was much worse. At
                    least, we had some notions of where the major problems were and the enormity of
                    the Government's task to bring about reform, should the Emperor give his
                    approval to move forward. In the mid-1960s, the hottest and most controversial
                    subject was land reform. We were convinced there could be no lasting political
                    stability or agricultural progress in Ethiopia until the land problem was
                    resolved. There were numerous variations on the land-grab theme, but the largest
                    chunks of land were those taken by the Government from the conquered peoples on
                    the periphery of the Amhara/Tigre heartland and partially distributed to the
                    Church, the victorious forces, and the ruling elite. Another category was the
                    land taken by the power elite from the weaker parties, including Amharas and
                    Tigres, through such means as corrupt courts, illegal seizures, or tampered
                    documents. I had a feeling that meaningful land reform was not going to happen
                    under Haile Selassie, despite the blatant wrongs and the seething resentment.
                    Control of land was one of the keys to political power in Ethiopia. I did not
                    see the Emperor as willing to take on the nobles, the generals, the Church, and
                    other big landowners over this issue. He, however, wanted to give the appearance
                    of doing something about the problem and set up a Government organization to
                    collect data and study the issue. It was called something on the order of the
                    “Institute for Cadastral Surveys and Land Reform”. Funding and some technical
                    assistance for the Institute came from the UN Development Program, the World
                    Bank, and some national donors. Even the limited surveys and studies by the
                    Institute began to document some of the past abuses. The students and other
                    critics of the regime were not mollified by the creation of the Institute. The
                    students took to the streets on several occasions for land reform. They
                    carefully avoided directly criticizing the Emperor, but cited the Institute and
                    some of the Emperor's own words to demand action. The students wanted
                    fundamental change. The most frequently mentioned idea was a parliamentary
                    democracy for Ethiopia, with the Emperor as titular head of state. This sounded
                    progressive to the students, and was in line with what was happening in many
                    newly-independent countries of Africa. Few students, however, seemed to think
                    that there was any chance that the Emperor lead in that direction. For a student
                    to speak publicly about such a change was simply too dangerous. They largely
                    kept their revolutionary zeal under control because they did not want to be
                    jailed or killed. They instead latched onto the theme of “land to the tiller,”
                    as a relatively safe (physically), but sufficiently progressive rallying call.
                    There were a half dozen demonstrations by the students on that theme: “take the
                    land away from the Church and nobility; give the land back to the tiller; set a
                    maximum amount any one person could own.” (The students during my time in
                    Ethiopia were careful about not mentioning the Emperor in their sloganeering.
                    Blaming the Ethiopian Orthodox Church or “the nobility” was sufficiently
                    provocative to cause a strong reaction from the police.) A thousand students
                    holding banners or placards would march out of the campus toward the Parliament
                    or the Prime Minister's Office. The police would eventually go charging in and
                    bash them with batons. Then the students would flee, and the police would chase
                    them down and arrest those they caught. They usually arrested several
                    hundred.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>The next day, a group of students would present a petition to the Emperor for the
                    release of their colleagues. Haile Selassie would use the occasion to chastise
                    the students for their disorderly conduct, their ingratitude for the reforms he
                    instituted, and the dangerous example they were setting for the less-educated
                    and less-privileged; commend the police for their restraint in the face of
                    terrible provocations; and appeal to the students' parents for better control of
                    their children. Often a delegation of parents or elders would also show up at
                    the Palace to plead for the release of the students. Sometimes a contingent of
                    police would be summoned and publicly praised for the exemplary performance of
                    their duty. Usually the arrested students were released several days later. The
                    Emperor sometimes used the occasion to make pronouncements along the lines of
                    “We are in favor of land-reform. That is the reason We have set up the Institute
                    to undertake surveys and to study what needs to be done. When the studies are
                    completed, We will redistribute the land.” I am not sure what the Emperor really
                    had in mind, but my guess is that any real reform was far down the list of HIM's
                    priorities. The students were demonstrating for land reform and had quiet,
                    discreet support from many of their professors and from some government civil
                    servants. (The students could demonstrate openly, with minimal consequences, but
                    any public show of support from other elements would have been regarded as
                    subversive.) Land reform (and the concomitant issues) was a subject we followed
                    closely. I wrote a dozen or so airgrams on this theme. Land reform also caught
                    Washington's attention, and the policy makers began to think about the
                    implications for the US. They liked the idea. USAID began thinking what they
                    could do to help. These are some examples of what I was reporting.</p>
                <p>There was also the requirement to purchase public documents from the Ethiopian
                    Government and send them to Washington. I also collected information from public
                    sources about Government officials, academics, businessmen, and other leading or
                    potentially leading figures.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>I was tasked with improving the Embassy's biographic reporting program. I was
                    fascinated by the intricate family relationships among the Ethiopian elite and
                    realized how critical blood and marriage ties were to understanding the
                    Ethiopian power structure. Sheldon Vance realized this and gave more attention
                    to biographic reporting. Unfortunately, the Embassy bio files were pretty sparse
                    when he arrived, except for the top hundred or so officials. He told the Embassy
                    officers to concentrate on the next layer. I was told to study what we had in
                    our bio files and to map out a plan to expand our coverage. I quickly noticed
                    there was little information on the wives of the men covered by our files. I
                    later learned that in some cases, those officials gained their positions through
                    their wives' family ties. One of the reasons for the lack of information about
                    the wives was obvious. No one at the Embassy knew enough Amharic to speak with
                    them. When Ed Korry arrived, he insisted we give more priority to bio reporting
                    and also tasked the USAID and MAAG officers with contributing. I spent a large
                    amount of time working out the multilevel family ties and writing biographical
                    reports as well as coordinating and editing the input from the country teaWhen I
                    left the Embassy, there were bios on over a thousand Ethiopians.</p>
                <p>As I followed developments in Ethiopia, initially as the Desk Officer and
                    subsequently from other positions in the Foreign Service, I observed the
                    accomplishments and careers of the students, junior military officers, young
                    academics, and civil servants whom I had come to know, had picked as potential
                    leaders, and about whom I had written extensive bio reports. Ethiopians were not
                    only quite knowledgeable about family ties, but usually were willing to speak
                    about such relationships. It is a subject of importance to their culture. They
                    needed to show family relationships in order to gain access to communal land (in
                    the traditional Amhara regions) through their ancestry. They would use family
                    ties, even very distant ones, to seek jobs, favors, influence, etc. Also of
                    enormous significance was the issue of family relationships and lineage in
                    marriage, both pro and con. Ethiopians traditionally are not allowed to marry
                    anyone closer than the fifth degree of consanguinity, and the really devout make
                    it seven degrees. That means they had to know who their cousins, nephews, and
                    nieces were at least to the fifth-degree of consanguinity to avoid being guilty
                    of incest. They were very knowledgeable about their families and often about the
                    families of friends, neighbors, classmates, and colleagues at work. It really
                    was not too difficult for the Embassy to chart family relationships. It required
                    time and access, plus some knowledge of the culture. Of course the Imperial
                    Family's relationships were well documented and publicized. Of greater interest
                    to the Embassy were the nexus of relations several levels down</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>Whenever I traveled, I made it a point to find out as much as I could about the
                    governors, the deputy governors, and the district and municipal officials, how
                    they were related, where they were born, where else they had served, their
                    education, and importantly, their views. The former were usually well known, and
                    I could discuss such “facts” openly with them. Often they were flattered to
                    think that someone from the American Embassy even cared about the curriculum
                    vitae. Concerning the latter, namely their views, that was the tricky part if
                    they were not solidly in the Emperor's camp. On the other hand, there were some
                    officials who had been exiled to the boondocks because they were suspected or
                    proven to be critical of the Emperor. Family relationships protected them from
                    prison, if the charges were not too grave. A few of these fellows were willing
                    to share their opinions with me to a certain degree. Given the flexibility and
                    the subtlety of the Amharic language, what they told me could be understood in
                    several ways. It was clear that they were in “exile” and not thrilled about
                    living away from their normal environment. Once I knew the family connections of
                    an official, I could place things I had heard about him or her in perspective.
                    For example why he could take away land from the people in his area with
                    impunity. Simple, his uncle was the Minister of the Interior and his wife's
                    sister was married to a close relative of the Emperor. One of the most difficult
                    aspects of following Ethiopian lineages is that names “disappear” after three
                    generations. For example, the son and daughter of Mr. Abebe Getu would be named
                    Berhe Abebe and Almaz Abebe. Berhe's son and daughter would be named Hailu Berhe
                    and Saba Berhe. Almaz's children would follow the same paradigm and be named
                    after their father. Females kept their own names after marriage, but there was
                    no indication of the mother's name in her child's name. That is the Ethiopian
                    naming system, so it is almost impossible without a chart to figure out from the
                    name alone the person's more distant antecedents or descendants. There were also
                    numerous divorces and sometimes “natural offspring” who were later recognized..
                    We could really have used a computer in those days.</p>
                <p>Q: We're always looking for places of power. That's what political observers do.
                    Did everything flow down from the Emperor, or were there perhaps other areas
                    where the Emperor was not interested in exercising power or where the governors
                    were influential in doing something or other, or did it all keep coming back to
                    the Emperor and the court?</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>BUCHE: Without sounding too naive or too prone to oversimplify, the Emperor was
                    the source of almost all power. His ability to move ministers and governors
                    around, which he did periodically, so that they could not build up a power base
                    or could not get any expertise was one way he exercised power. He moved
                    governors and judges around, moved generals out to be governors, governors in to
                    be ministers, shuffled the military and police constantly. He had three or four
                    intelligence systems running concurrently, spying on each other and spying on
                    everyone else. In his prime he was able to keep the many balls in the air. He
                    was pretty busy keeping things in motion, but that was a source of power. There
                    was an inherent instability to the system, since he was the only person who had
                    the full view. While he would occasionally tolerate and even praise independent
                    initiatives by subordinates, such actions were usually viewed negatively and
                    punished in some way. Officials in Addis Ababa or in the provinces learned that
                    it was safer to consult with the Emperor before undertaking an action that was
                    not routine. We heard of many sudden assignments to the provinces or from one
                    province to another, where the rumors had it that the cause was displeasure on
                    the part of the Emperor at an action by the official. I can imagine a typical
                    scenario where someone from the Imperial Palace telephones the official along
                    the following lines: “His Imperial Majesty has graciously decided that you would
                    be better suited to become the district governor of XYZ (about 500 miles away
                    from where he was currently working). As of today your appointment as district
                    governor in ABC is terminated. You will report for duty in seven days. His
                    Imperial Majesty regrets that in this time of national austerity, there will be
                    no funds available to cover your moving expenses.” The Emperor grabbed power as
                    a young man and held on against many rival contenders for decades. He was
                    shrewd, cunning, far-sighted, and decisive in his prime. In 1963 when I arrived
                    in Ethiopia, I believe the Emperor was about at the zenith of his mental
                    abilities. What he accomplished on the international scene over the next several
                    years was most impressive. The fact that he held the country together in the
                    1960s as well as he did, given the many internal and external challenges,
                    demonstrates his extraordinary talents. By the late 1960s, however, it seemed to
                    me that his powers began failing him.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about mental powers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Both his physical and mental powers began to weaken., and the system
                    became unglued. You could see in the late '60s, early '70s, that things were
                    coming undone. He could no longer juggle hundreds of important issues, keep up a
                    heavy schedule of foreign and domestic travel, decide on the numerous personnel
                    appointments, and continue to dispense instructions, rewards, and punishments
                    through face-to-face meetings with his officials. He was aging and showed signs
                    of mental and physical weariness. Concomitantly, the Ethiopian internal
                    situation was developing in ways detrimental to the continuation of the
                    Emperor's traditional way of ruling. Ideologies advocating basic changes in
                    Ethiopia's political, social, and economic relationships were gaining adherents.
                    The critics and enemies of Haile Selassie and imperial rule were becoming bolder
                    in their opposition, as they saw the increasing support for change among the
                    educated elite in the military and in the civilian bureaucracy.</p>

                        started out,I think, as regent in 1913 or thereabouts</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Yes, he had a remarkable run for his money. Haile Selassie began
                    accumulating power already as a teenager. In 1913, he was made Regent and
                    recognized as the heir apparent. He was crowned Emperor in 1930.. He showed his
                    political genius in the way he advanced toward his goal of becoming Emperor. He
                    had some advantages because of his father, but he had to outwit or defeat
                    several formidable rivals before he could gain the crown.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like on anything government to government that
                        therwas not much need for going to ministries.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: We went to the ministries because that was where the decision-making
                    process began. If a minister had not already received instructions on the issue
                    from the Palace, he would know how to respond within a few days because the
                    Emperor had ministerial meetings almost every day. I think once in a while the
                    ministers would meet together with the Emperor for ceremonial reasons, but they
                    usually just sat outside his office in the Palace, until he called them in one
                    at a time. They would have ten or fifteen minutes to explain to His Imperial
                    Majesty the issues involved. Sometimes the minister would get a quick decision,
                    and sometimes he would be told to leave the papers for further study. The
                    minister would then call up Ambassador Korry and say, “His Imperial Majesty has
                    conveyed through me the following decision, or His Imperial Majesty is still
                    studying the matter.” Of course, there were some issues that our Ambassador had
                    to discuss directly with the Emperor. The American Ambassador could get an
                    appointment with the Emperor on short notice.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>The Emperor seemed to be near the height of his mental powers during my time in
                    Ethiopia. When I came back from Ethiopia, I was on the Ethiopian Desk for three
                    years. As I recall, he still was still pretty sharp mentally. He was juggling
                    new considerations, however. One was the rise of the independent African states
                    and the OAU. He decided that Ethiopia was not going to be swept up in the flood
                    of popular democracy, anti-colonialism, and “African” socialism. He saw the
                    dangers to his power from the ideologies of Sekou Toure, Nasser, Jomo Kenyatta,
                    et al. Haile Selassie had impeccable credentials as an anti-colonialist, but he
                    also had excellent relations with the colonial powers. He had invited many young
                    nationalist leaders to Addis Ababa when they were sorely in need of a little bit
                    of money and some stroking, and he treated them magnificently. He was able to
                    use the African independence movement to his and Ethiopia's advantage. We were
                    amazed at how cleverly he handled this whole thing. He brought the African
                    leaders together and persuaded them to sign the charter of the Organization of
                    African Unity. He had set up the diplomatic work several years in advance and
                    brought in a Chilean expert to write the charter (based to a large extent on the
                    OAS). The Emperor was able to bring regional enemies and rivals together from
                    the rest of Africa - the Moroccans, Tunisians, and the Algerians, Nasser and
                    Sekou Toure. It worked, and they sat down and signed the Charter of the OAU in
                    1963. The Charter was not something that they saw for the first time in Addis;
                    it was circulated much earlier. It was very cleverly written, so there was a
                    very strong emphasis on “pre-colonial borders.” There were some countries that
                    did not want that concept included, in particular, Somalia. The Emperor cleverly
                    isolated the Somalis before the conference, and they had to go along. Most
                    African countries wanted pre-colonial borders. There was no alternative to the
                    concept, but war.</p>
                <p>Q: It's been an article of faith with us, anyway, that once you uncork this -
                    whoosh - I mean, the whole Continent would fall apart into a thousand little
                    tribal enclaves, and so like it or lump it, there it is.</p>
                <p>BUCHE -The Charter did allow an escape clause, something along the line that
                    these unjust colonial borders shall remain, unless mutually agreed to by all
                    parties concerned. That could mean the barrel of a gun, but it was enough to
                    allow everyone to sign. Also there was a dispute-solving mechanism. The Emperor
                    figured that his prestige could be enhanced if the OAU became the venue for
                    intra-African dispute negotiations. The OAU had a crisis on its hands within
                    months after the Charter was signed. It was the Moroccan-Algerian War. That
                    crisis was followed by others throughout the Continent with numerous
                    assassinations and coups d'�tat in dozens of African countries. Many of the
                    disputes did end up at the OAU in Addis Ababa. The Emperor almost always was
                    involved in some way in seeking a resolution of the disputes.</p>

                    in Yugoslavia as chief of the Consular Section during this time you were in
                    Addis, and the African students who had ended up in Bulgaria basically revolted,
                    and they came out through Yugoslavia. They felt they had been badly mistreated
                    by the Bulgarians, and there was much of this from coming out of Lumumba
                    University in Moscow. Were you getting any reflection of the Soviet attempt to
                    educate Ethiopians during this time?</p>
                <p>BUCHE: Well, the Soviets recognized the potential of the students, and they were
                    trying to get a foothold at the Haile Selassie University. The University was
                    heavily American-oriented. This was something that upset the British enormously,
                    because they had played a key role in liberating Ethiopia from the Italian
                    occupation and had provided the Royal Family of Ethiopia with asylum during the
                    war years. The British thought they would be asked to set up an African Oxbridge
                    in Ethiopia. The Americans were also eager to help the Ethiopians to establish a
                    university, with US Government funds and foundation money, particularly the Ford
                    Foundation. Several American universities were seeking to set up cooperative
                    arrangements. The Emperor took his time to weigh the options. He probably also
                    considered the state of the UK's finances and concluded that Her Majesty's
                    Government would not have much money for a non-Commonwealth country. He chose
                    the American concept. The Soviets were basically left out. Since Ethiopia was
                    officially non-aligned, the Emperor had to balance what he was doing with the
                    Americans by something for the Soviets. They were allowed to set up a technical
                    institute in Bahir-Dar, which was a small town, a rough day's ride from Addis
                    Ababa on the southern shore of Lake Tana. They set up an institute in Bahir-Dar
                    as part of the University, but it conferred only associate degrees in the
                    technical fields. The Soviets were also allowed to place a few professors on the
                    main campus of Haile Selassie University in Addis Ababa. There were, if my
                    recollection is correct, maybe two or three Russian professors. I think they
                    were on the medical or the mathematics faculty.</p>
                <p>What the Soviets did at the time was to offer scholarships to Lumumba University
                    in Moscow, and lean on the East Germans, the Bulgarians, and other Eastern
                    European allies to offer scholarships. The Ethiopian Government did not turn
                    these scholarships down. There was not a long line of Ethiopians waiting to go,
                    but if they were turned down by the Americans, the Brits, or the Canadians, they
                    applied. Maybe their thinking went along the lines that it may not be too bad to
                    go to Lumumba, particularly when word began circulating in Addis that if they
                    went for a year or two and then “defected” while on vacation in Western Europe,
                    they were almost sure of getting an American scholarship. I do not know how many
                    Ethiopians tried the “defection” gambit, but about a hundred Ethiopian students
                    departed the country annually for study in the U.S.S.R. and in Eastern Europe.
                    Ethiopian policy was that undergraduates should go to the local University. At
                    first, the USG financed some undergraduates for US colleges, but as the Haile
                    Selassie University developed, we stopped that policy and funded only graduate
                    students.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>The Soviets were playing that game, too. They were offering scholarships on the
                    graduate level, but were at some disadvantage: the students had to learn a new
                    language; Moscow was cold; and the prospective students were not sure what type
                    of education they would receive or what their job prospects would be if they
                    returned to Ethiopia. AID had a hefty budget for scholarships at the graduate
                    level, and there was also the Fulbright Program under the US Information
                    Service, but not enough to meet the demand. One day, a dozen unsuccessful
                    scholarship applicants came to the Embassy and asked to see Ambassador Korry. He
                    met with them, and they told him that if did not arrange for scholarships to the
                    USA, they would go to Lumumba University. He responded, “Well, that's wonderful!
                    We think you should go to Lumumba University. They can offer you an opportunity
                    for a good education.” They were shocked at his response, but he was not going
                    to yield to threats or get into a bidding contest.</p>
                <p>In a similar fashion, the Prime Minister and the Minister of State for Education,
                    the Aklilu brothers, at a social occasion, confronted Ambassador Korry and
                    pleaded for another hundred scholarships through the USAID program. They
                    threatened to send some excellent students to the USSR if they did not obtain
                    the additional scholarships. Korry asked them whom they planned to send to the
                    USSR. They replied they would send the most conservative students to the Soviet
                    Union and the more radical ones to the United States. He said, “You're doing it
                    all wrong. What you ought to do is send your most radical students to Moscow.”
                    He then proposed a plan to the two Ministers. “I can get you some money, so that
                    you can fund more students for the USSR. (The Ethiopian Government had to pay
                    transport and some other expenses for its students going to the USSR.) Korry's
                    idea knocked those two Ministers for a loop. He said he would try to get some
                    money from Washington to send more students. The condition was that the
                    Ethiopian Government had to agree to start sending the most radical students.
                    The two Aklilu brothers thought that he was pulling their leg, but Korry was
                    really serious.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>The next day he expounded on this at the Country Team meeting, and the reaction
                    was along the lines of, “Ed, you're absolutely out of your mind. Those students
                    are going to come back and start a revolution.” He retorted, “No, they 're going
                    to come back, and they're going to work against a revolution, because they will
                    have seen what Russia, what the Soviet Union, is all about.” He put his request
                    in writing, and Washington thought the plan was crazy, so it went nowhere. Korry
                    was certain his idea was sound, and after the initial shock, several of us were
                    also convinced this is what we should do. Help the Ethiopian Government
                    (covertly) to send the radical students to Lumumba University, where they would
                    be offended by the Russian racist attitudes, shocked at the low living levels of
                    the people, and disappointed by the quality of education. The other side of his
                    proposal was for the Ethiopian Government to send the more conservative students
                    to the USA and to Western European universities. He reasoned that by continuing
                    the current policy of sending the leftist students to the United States and
                    Western Europe, they would be encouraged by their radical American professors to
                    become even more revolutionary. When the army mutinies and revolts started in
                    Ethiopia in 1973, many of the civilian leaders who joined their cause were
                    students who had studied in the United States and France. Not many of the
                    Soviet-trained students were involved in the early days of the revolt. The real
                    leaders had trained in the USA and Western Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, like Nkrumah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Yes, and some other African revolutionaries. The Ethiopian students were
                    seen as a critical group, along with the young military officers. Both groups
                    were courted by various embassies. There were four Amharic speakers in the
                    diplomatic corps at that time, one at the British Embassy, two at the Russian
                    Embassy, and myself. The two Russian Amharic speakers were very good. We ran
                    into each other occasionally on the campus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How important was the army?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>BUCHE: It was an article of faith that as long as the army stayed united and
                    loyal to the Emperor, his throne was secure. There could be insurrections, but
                    the army could put them down. The police had only some light weapons, so they
                    were not a real force. We were trying, through our Military Advisory Assistance
                    Group (MAAG) and our Defense Attaches, to learn more about the younger army
                    officers. It was difficult to get close to the group. Neither they nor their
                    superiors (nor the Ethiopian security officers) wanted the MAAG officers or the
                    attaches from any of the embassies to get very close. The job of the MAAG was to
                    train the Ethiopian officers in tactics, command structure, communications,
                    maintenance, and other military skills. They were not trained to gather
                    intelligence on how the Ethiopian officers regarded the Emperor, their
                    superiors, their colleagues, those advocating reform, or to how to make informed
                    estimates regarding personal or unit loyalties. We realized we would have to
                    help the MAAG in this endeavor. A partial solution was for me to accompany the
                    MAAG training teams as they went out into the field. I would try to get to know
                    some of the Ethiopian officers, to see who they were, what they were like, and
                    to try to help the MAAG officers to do the same. After a half dozen trips with
                    the MAAG, I concluded I did not learn a great deal about the thinking of
                    individual Ethiopian officers, but I obtained a much better feel for some of the
                    many, many problems of the country. About all I could get from the officers was
                    their career path, where they had served, their education, and something about
                    their family. It was better than nothing - which was what we had in our files on
                    most of the young officers. The big plus was to spend several days with the
                    Ethiopian military in the far reaches of the Empire (the Ogaden, the southern
                    provinces of Bale Goba and Sidamo, and near the Eritrean border) and to observe
                    their interaction with the local people. We really needed some MAAG officers who
                    were interested in the political developments in Ethiopia and who would over
                    several years get to know a dozen Ethiopian officers well enough that they could
                    share with the Embassy something more than raw data of a CV. From Korry on down
                    to me, we were convinced the military, and especially the younger officers, the
                    captains, majors, and colonels, largely controlled the direction and fate of the
                    Ethiopian Government in the near future. It was frustrating that we knew so
                    little about this potentially key group, but what was even more maddening was
                    that we could not adequately take advantage of a superb entr�e into the group,
                    the MAAG. Despite Korry's efforts with the MAAG CO and several senior officers,
                    we did not get very far. They promised closer cooperation, and in some cases did
                    so (allowing an Embassy officer to accompany field training teams), but they did
                    not see the task as a priority. The MAAG was in Ethiopia to train the Ethiopian
                    military. The individual U.S. officers would be evaluated and promoted on the
                    success of their achievements in the training area. They did not see gathering
                    political intelligence as their job. They so often replied to Korry and others
                    at the Embassy with some sort of variation of that was the military attach�s'
                    job. The military attach�s in my time in Ethiopia did not do much in the line of
                    political intelligence gathering among the Ethiopian military. They followed the
                    order of battle, location of units, collected names and biographic data. Who
                    were the major unit commanders, the deputy commanders, the company commanders?
                    What was the status of the two officers going to Fort Leavenworth and who is
                    going to Fort Benning, and who will be going to learn small unit tactics or
                    communications at this or that school? I remember one session in 1964 with the
                    attaches when Korry and Sheldon prodded them to learn more about morale problems
                    of units or individual officers. Korry said there must be some colonels who are
                    unhappy, or some majors and maybe some brigadier generals, or maybe even some
                    generals who are discouraged, resentful, or frustrated. Do you know of any or
                    have you heard rumors of such? Their answers were negative, and the discussion
                    ended soon thereafter. About a month later, there was an attempted coup by a
                    dozen middle-level military officers, all of whom were in frequent contact with
                    the MAAG. One (Lieutenant Colonel Imru Wondie) was known to the Embassy, since
                    his wife worked at the USIS Library. The coup was unsuccessful. (One of the
                    co-conspirators betrayed the plot to the Government.) The local CIA Station was
                    also focusing on the military and had developed some sources. The CIA learned
                    about the 1964 coup while it was still in the late planning stage. I was asked
                    to translate some of the documents the CIA had acquired. The CIA had penetrated
                    some elements of the military and were getting some information. What was
                    interesting about the 1964 coup attempt was the fact that the CIA had
                    subsequently learned that several of the plotters were known by their fellow
                    officers to be outspoken in their criticism of the top generals (and by
                    implication, the Emperor). This was not picked up by the MAAG or the Attaches
                    during their contacts with the individuals.I learned from one of my
                    acquaintances at the University that a dozen Ethiopian Air Force officers were
                    taking evening courses there. I mentioned this to Sheldon Vance, and he passed
                    it on to the Ambassador. Korry called me to his office and suggested that I
                    should enroll. You will get to know not only the Air Force officers, but other
                    students and some faculty members. So I became a student for four evenings a
                    week in courses on political science and Ethiopian geography. The Political
                    Science course was taught by a young Ethiopian Ph.D. from an Ivy League school,
                    Amare Tekle. He later became the principal political advisor to the OAU. The
                    geography course was taught by Mesfin Wolde Mariam. He was a well known critic
                    of the regime at the time. (He eventually became critical of the Mengistu and
                    Meles regimes and was arrested by both!) In the political science, we were given
                    reading assignments from Plato, Aristotle, Montesquieu, the American
                    Constitution, and Wilson's Fourteen Points. In the Ethiopian context, such ideas
                    were bordering on the revolutionary. There were interesting classroom
                    discussions. The students were careful not to criticize the current Ethiopian
                    political situation directly. They, instead, expressed their admiration for the
                    ideals contained in the readings and realized to varying degrees in Western
                    states. There were always several agents from the Security enrolled in each
                    University class taking notes, but the professors and the students were clever
                    enough not to say anything personally incriminating. I had had the political
                    science material in greater depth before, but the content of the geography class
                    was almost entirely new for me. I entered into class discussions at times, but
                    preferred to listen to others express their views. I took both courses as
                    non-credit, so that if there were a grading curve, I would not be competing
                    against the Ethiopians. I got to know some of the other students, as well as my
                    two professors. I also realized that my fellow students, Air Force Officers and
                    young bureaucrats and businessmen, were highly critical and resentful toward the
                    regime, even though they were careful in their actual words. They were not as
                    daring or as rash as the full-time students of the University, but they were
                    probably just as angry and frustrated. And in the case of the Air Force
                    officers, they were potentially in a position to do something other than a
                    protest march. The following semester I took courses in Ethiopian constitutional
                    law from Professor Berekete-Ab Habte Selassie and in Ethiopian ethnic groups
                    from Dr. Fekadu Gedamu.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>To answer your question in another way, we were convinced the military was the
                    key to Ethiopia's future. We did not know how long the Emperor could hang on,
                    and what would be the circumstances of his removal from the scene - death from
                    natural causes, an incapacitating stroke, assassination, arrest, etc.? Who would
                    make the successful move? Would the move or action come from the top generals
                    and their civilian allies because they were threatened or felt that they had to
                    take pre-emptive action? Or was the action to come from the brigadier generals,
                    colonels, and the lower ranks? The permutations were endless, so we watched,
                    took notes, and did our best to get to know as many potential future leaders as
                    possible. Ambassador Korry made that a top priority in the allocation of our
                    resources. We even formalized our priorities under the Department's “Policy
                    Planning and Resource Allocation Program.” (This was a novel program for the
                    DOS, although in the Pentagon and in many large corporations, it was a
                    fundamental management tool. Addis Ababa was one of the first posts selected to
                    inaugurate the program, largely because Korry saw the potential benefits and
                    asked to be included in the experiment. We were extremely fortunate to have Jack
                    Gloster assigned to the Embassy to help us get started.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we get involved with the Ethiopians over relations
                        witSomalia, over the Ogaden?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Yes, we did not only for strategic reasons, but also because we had a
                    clause in our agreement with them about the use of our military equipment. They
                    could not use the equipment we provided outside of Ethiopia, and they could use
                    it only inside Ethiopia to repulse or to defend the country against “external
                    forces”. The Ethiopian Government interpreted that to mean Somalis, whether
                    internal or external, since they regarded any attacks on Ethiopians in the
                    Ogaden as basically supported from outside. The Ethiopian Government maintained
                    that the weapons and support for the attacks in the Ogaden were coming from the
                    Somali Republic. We basically acquiesced in the use of USG-supplied weapons,
                    planes, and ground equipment against Somali forces inside of Ethiopia, but were
                    strongly opposed to their use outside of the country. Despite the agreement, the
                    Ethiopian military crossed the borders. They bombed Hargeisa on at least one
                    occasion with our planes, and took our tanks and APCs into northern Somalia in
                    pursuit of Somali forces or to make a show of force. Once they went across the
                    border into the territory of Djibouti while pursuing a Somali force and ran into
                    a French Foreign Legion unit on maneuvers, but the Ethiopians retreated rapidly
                    back to their country.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>Whenever we learned that the Ethiopians crossed borders, we raised hell with the
                    Prime Minister or the Defense Minister. Their response was usually, “we went
                    only a couple of kilometers inside and were in hot pursuit”. I remember one time
                    when Vance heard from the MAAG that an Ethiopian unit had crossed the Somali
                    border. He got on the phone to the Minister of Defense and told him, “You had
                    better get those APCs back on this side of the border immediately.” The Minister
                    replied, “I think we've accomplished our mission.” So he ordered them to return.
                    We kept saying to the Ethiopians not to overreact. There were some Ethiopian
                    officials who had a fixation on bombing Mogadishu. We, of course, told them it
                    was unwise to consider such an action. We all knew that it was not possible for
                    our F-5 fighters to reach Mogadishu from any existing base in Ethiopia. That was
                    a real problem, so the Ethiopian Government decided to build an airport deep in
                    the Ogaden at a site called Gode. We told them they should not do that, but they
                    persisted. They remonstrated that they were a sovereign nation and could build
                    an airport wherever they desired. That was, of course, true, but we also held
                    some trump cards. We told them we would refuse to give them navigation equipment
                    and spare parts; we would forbid our MAAG teams from going to the new airport to
                    provide technical assistance; and we would hold them accountable if any of our
                    planes crossed a border. We could not persuade them to abandon the idea, but the
                    Embassy successfully delayed any concrete actions. They eventually wasted money
                    and built an airport. They did not station our planes there, however, possibly
                    because of the vulnerability of the planes to ground attacks. The Ethiopians
                    would have needed several battalions of troops to protect the planes from a
                    mortar attack.</p>
                <p>Relations between Ethiopia and Somalia were tenuous, at best. There was constant
                    strife, friction, and fighting in the Ogaden. While I was at the Embassy, there
                    were ambushes and small-unit attacks by the Somalis. The Ethiopians would
                    sometimes succeed in intercepting raiding parties or engage the small units in
                    battle. More often, however, the Ethiopians would suffer casualties and not be
                    able to locate the aggressors. They would then retaliate against civilians, by
                    taking away their livestock or vehicles or burning their tents. It was
                    constantly attack, counter-attack, and reprisal.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>The situation in the Ogaden was deteriorating, and both the Ethiopian and the
                    U.S. authorities were concerned. We were asked by the Ethiopians to send Special
                    Forces to provide the Ethiopian military with counter-insurgency training. There
                    was some squeamishness on Washington's part about where the training would be
                    given, but the decision was made to do it in the Ogaden. The sites selected were
                    major Ethiopian military outposts. Washington was afraid of an attack by the
                    Somalis on an Ethiopian unit while the Special Forces were around. The Special
                    Forces might get caught up in the fighting. Maybe there would be a casualty or
                    two. Then the American public would ask what were the Special Forces doing in
                    the Ogaden? Fortunately, there were no incidents. I was pleased to be allowed to
                    accompany one of the teams for about a week of their usual month-long training
                    sessions. Not only did I get an up-close view of the Ogaden, with its harsh
                    environment, but I got an earful of the views of the Ethiopian Army officers who
                    were confronted daily with a hostile, armed population. The officers seemed to
                    regard the Somalis the way I imagined the U.S. Cavalry thought about the
                    American Indians in the post-Civil War era. The Special Forces team, however,
                    told the Ethiopian military that to defeat the insurgency they had to improve
                    their anti-guerrilla tactics and also to convince the local population that it
                    had more to gain from cooperation with Ethiopia than supporting the insurgency.
                    The Special Forces spoke about winning over the Somalis. For a day and a half,
                    the Ethiopians just kept their mouths shut and listened to the Americans speak
                    about hearts and minds, building bridges to local Somali elders and leaders,
                    treating the sick Somalis, giving inoculations, avoiding reprisals, etc. The
                    Ethiopians were resigned to putting up with that. Then the good stuff began. How
                    to set an ambush, how to defend against an ambush, how to develop local
                    intelligence sources, how to interrogate captured fighters, etc. The Ethiopians
                    were really interested, and the sessions lasted into the night. The Special
                    Forces trainers were real professionals. Most of them had experience in Vietnam,
                    and some of them also had been active in Latin America and the Congo, so they
                    were knowledgeable. The Ethiopians I observed respected the Special Forces team
                    and listened to their advice on tactical issues. The Ethiopian army officers,
                    however, were unconvinced about the “hearts and minds” aspects of the
                    training.</p>
                <p>Anike and I departed Ethiopia in July of 1966. We were looking forward to living
                    in Washington and seeing our families more regularly. My parents were living in
                    Indiana, and Anike's parents were in Huntersville, North Carolina. We were also
                    looking forward to consulting top-notch medical specialists about Anike's
                    inability to carry her pregnancies to term as a result of our RH
                    incompatibility. As we said good-bye to the many Ethiopians whom we had met and
                    had grown to like, we wondered when we would be seeing them again. Since I was
                    assigned to the Ethiopian Desk in the Department, I was confident I would be
                    seeing many of them when I returned in a year or so for consultations with the
                    Embassy. Anike had made a lot of Ethiopian friends on her own. She worked with
                    Don Paradis and Seyoum Haregot in the Prime Minister's Office for over a year
                    and with Habte Selassie Tafessa, the head of the Ethiopian Tourist Organization,
                    for about two years. As I had assumed, I did return. Anike did not return until
                    1970, when we stopped in Addis Ababa for a week en route to a posting in
                    Blantyre, Malawi.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the 25th of August, 1999. John, you were on the

                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: I was on the Ethiopian Desk, and we had a mix of countries and
                    responsibilities within our office. There was a Somali Desk officer (Gordon
                    Beyer), a Sudanese Desk officer (Ned Schaefer), and an Ethiopian Desk officer
                    (at first it was Peter Walker, and later it was Jack Gloster), who also served
                    as the Deputy Office Director. I was the Assistant Ethiopian Desk Officer. We
                    were all under the Office Director for Northeast Africa, Matthew Looram. The
                    acronym for our office was AF/NE.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought the Sudan would have been more
                        logical undethe Bureau for Near Eastern Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: One time it was, but when the African Bureau was created in 1961, the
                    responsibility for Sudan was placed in AF. In much of our work, we had to
                    coordinate closely with the Bureau for Near Eastern Affairs (NEA). The impetus
                    for the move was the rush of newly independent African states. I suppose the
                    idea of consolidating all of the Continent's independent states into one Bureau
                    made sense. There was an exception for Egypt; it remained in NEA. The countries
                    that were still under colonial status, such as Mozambique, Guinea Bissau, and
                    Angola, remained under the European Bureau (EUR). The Assistant Secretary for AF
                    when I began in AF/NE was Joseph Palmer. He succeeded Williams and was succeeded
                    by David Newsom.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>But going back to what I did on the Ethiopian Desk, one of the first things was
                    to prepare for the official visit of Haile Selassie to the United States in
                    February 1967, and what we wanted to do in relation to that visit. The protocol
                    aspects or the guest lists were no problem. The problem was to find agreement in
                    Washington on what we would tell the Emperor and what we would promise to
                    provide regarding military and economic assistance. The Embassy and Washington
                    regarded this visit as crucial for Ethiopia and our interests in that country.
                    Korry had been speaking to the Emperor, to cabinet ministers, military officers,
                    and Members of Parliament, and to persons and groups outside the Government such
                    as businessmen, professors, and on several occasions to the students at Haile
                    Selassie University about what was needed to improve the Government's ability to
                    function more efficiently and to provide a better and more secure life for the
                    Ethiopian people, including more schools and health clinics, a less corrupt
                    judicial system, meaningful land reform, and better military security. Our
                    motives were both altruistic and calculated self-interest.</p>
                <p>Korry had almost convinced Washington that our long-term strategic interests in
                    Ethiopia were more than the unimpeded use of Kagnew Station. The State
                    Department was beginning to win the argument with DOD that the United States had
                    much to gain strategically from a long-term cooperative relationship with
                    Ethiopia, even without Kagnew Station. It was also in our interest that Ethiopia
                    develop economically, that the military become better trained and equipped, that
                    the government become more efficient, that basic services be provided, and that
                    festering land issues be addressed. Washington was leaning toward more economic
                    assistance to Ethiopia (partly in response to the recommendations in the Korry
                    Report on economic assistance to Africa), as well as increased and
                    better-focused military assistance. We knew the Emperor would ask for both.
                    There were major differences, however, between the Emperor and the U.S.
                    Government in the desired composition of the two packages. We wanted to increase
                    the efficiency of the military forces, not increase their size or provide new
                    weapons systems. We also had some ideas about increasing the efficiency of the
                    Ethiopian Government, starting with the Ministry of Finance. This was a
                    necessary first step in increasing the overall efficiency of the Government, and
                    one that would least upset the internal political balance.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>We thought it could be sold to the Emperor in part as a technological
                    advancement. The Ministry of Finance (as with most of the Ethiopian Government
                    ministries) had grown like Topsy over the years from a small group of trusted
                    officials who were empowered by the Emperor to perform certain functions as part
                    of his personal entourage, in this case to collect taxes and customs duties and
                    pay out whatever he authorized. The ministries eventually moved out of the
                    Palace, but they were still regarded as extensions of the Emperor's personal
                    domains. There were laws promulgated by the Emperor defining the organization of
                    the various ministries and the their competencies. There were also laws
                    regarding tax rates, custom duties, et cetera, but they were selectively
                    enforced. The wealthy and powerful of the Empire paid little taxes. The civil
                    service, military, persons working for a salary in private firms, and peasants
                    were the source of much of the revenue. The Ministry of Finance in the mid-1960s
                    was still following many practices of the Menelik era. Employees were still
                    going around tying up bundles of documents with red ribbon and depositing them
                    in archives. Each office had its own storage or archive; the key was held by a
                    guard. When an official wanted to retrieve a file, he or she had to request the
                    guard to do so. If the guard was not available, it was difficult to obtain the
                    file. Taxes were “negotiable” for those who were not on a salary (and the
                    withholding system). There were many officials in the Ministry who could decide
                    on the level of tax owed by a party. Thus there were many opportunities for
                    bribes. If a person could not work out an acceptable level of taxes within the
                    Ministry, the Emperor became the final arbiter. Until His Imperial Majesty
                    decided, the parties did not have to pay.</p>
                <p>Our Embassy and, of course, our AID Mission discussed reform of the Ministry at
                    length with the Emperor, the Prime Minister, the Finance Minister, and the
                    Director of Customs. The latter was theoretically subordinate to the Minister of
                    Finance, but in reality, he reported to the Emperor. We had great support and
                    valuable “intelligence” from the technocrats in the Ministry and elsewhere in
                    the Government. As Korry and colleagues, along with the World Bank
                    representative in Addis Ababa, Mahmoud Burney, (he was not given strong backing
                    from his headquarters in Washington), began to lay out the case for
                    modernization, no Ethiopian official came out directly in opposition to a reform
                    of the Ministry. They all agreed it was an archaic institution and had to be
                    modernized. They then quietly went to work to protect their own spheres while
                    supporting “reform” of the other parts of the Ministry. They succeeded in
                    killing any meaningful reform. The Emperor could have decreed a reorganization,
                    but he went along with the higher officials and decided to “study” the issue.
                    Korry also had spoken several times to the Emperor suggesting that he devolve
                    more power to the Prime Minister by giving him the power to select his own
                    cabinet. Although the Department thought this concept was a necessary aspect of
                    reform, it was too early to raise the idea in Washington during the visit.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>Regarding the military, MAAG and Ambassador Korry thought a smaller, but
                    better-trained and equipped force was essential to Ethiopia's security and our
                    long-term interests. Washington debated whether to recommend to President
                    Johnson that he encourage the Emperor toward reform in general and specifically
                    the Ministry of Finance and the Ethiopian military. The Washington bureaucracy
                    could not agree on any details so the policy makers decided on the easiest
                    approach, namely to recommend that the President suggest to the Emperor that he
                    seriously consider reforming his own Government and making his military more
                    efficient, better led and trained. We all knew this was a cop-out, but there
                    were too many disagreements within the USG to do anything else but offer
                    platitudes. For one thing, our Department of Defense did not have an agreed
                    position on the optimum level or distribution of Ethiopian military forces. AID
                    and State did not have the answers regarding the ability of the Ethiopian
                    Government to support financially force levels at varying strengths or mixes.
                    There was no agreement on the threat level to Ethiopia. There was disagreement
                    among State, the CIA, and the DOD/DIA on the nature of the threat from Somalia
                    and the role of the Soviet Union in arming Somalia.</p>
                <p>There was also no agreement within the intelligence community on how much of the
                    Ogaden insurgency was home-grown and how much was externally instigated. The
                    insurgency in Eritrea was turning ugly, but the Ethiopians seemed to have it
                    fairly “well contained” according to some of the intelligence analysts. There
                    was, however, no agreement in Washington on how serious the Eritrean insurgency
                    was to be regarded. The Ethiopian Government seemed much more concerned about
                    the Ogaden than Eritrea. Since Kagnew was in Eritrea, there were deep
                    differences of opinion on what the USG should do to safeguard that installation.
                    We in AF/NE wrote and re-wrote position papers for the Assistant Secretary and
                    the Under Secretary for Political Affairs to discuss in Inter-Agency meetings in
                    preparation for the visit. Ambassador Korry had strong ideas on what the
                    President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and Assistant
                    Secretary Palmer should say to the Emperor and why. Korry expected at a minimum
                    that we would not undercut what he was telling His Imperial Majesty and HIM's
                    ministers and generals about the need for reform and modernization. The Emperor
                    was suspicious of any advice from the USG that involved reducing the size of his
                    military. He wanted to expand the military to meet the threats in the Ogaden, in
                    Eritrea, and possibly from the Sudan. Korry reported that he agreed with the
                    Emperor there were threats from Somalia, but he tried to convey to him that
                    there were also threats to the stability of Ethiopia from within, such as delays
                    in land reform and modernization of government institutions.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we feel about the Emperor at that point? Were we
                        feelinthat he was getting pretty old? Was he able to concentrate?</hi>

                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>BUCHE: The Emperor was still sharp and lucid. He was not, however, thinking in
                    the way that we were hoping. He did not want to think new thoughts or consider
                    new ideas. We believed that his Government was beginning to come unglued. He
                    apparently did not see any deterioration, and was not about to change the way he
                    had governed Ethiopia for nearly forty years. If he had been less alert, maybe
                    there were ways of achieving some of our goals. The Emperor came to Washington
                    confident that he would obtain essentially what he sought.</p>
                <p>The visit started off on a discordant note. There was a sit-in by Ethiopian
                    students at the Ethiopian Embassy. This had not been done before. The students
                    in the two previous state visits had welcomed him at the airport and at Blair
                    House. From written accounts, they cheered him when he came, and he received
                    them en masse. If they had petitions, he would accept them. He then ordered his
                    private treasurer to give each student some fresh $20 bills. In 1967, the
                    welcoming by the students was hostile and even insulting. He was embarrassed.
                    Most of the Ethiopian students in the US were not financed by Ethiopian funds,
                    but by US Government contracts through AID and with various universities. He
                    blamed the Ethiopian Ambassador for not keeping the students under better
                    scrutiny. So he got off to a slightly less than exuberant start, but he
                    recovered quickly. The official welcoming at the White House by President
                    Johnson was an impressive ceremony. The official talks began the following
                    day.</p>
                <p>On a personal note, I served as an interpreter during some of the meetings and
                    was a note-taker in others. I was primarily the interpreter for Ras Mesfin
                    Sileshi, the Emperor's longtime comrade in arms and supporter. The Emperor used
                    Dr. Minassie Haile, the Foreign Affairs Advisor in his Private Cabinet, as
                    interpreter. Dr. Minassie had received a Ph.D. from Columbia University in
                    political science and was married to an American. The Emperor understood English
                    fairly well and spoke it haltingly. His French was excellent.</p>
                <p>I was sharing interpreting duties with an ex-Peace Corps volunteer who was
                    working at Peace Corps Headquarters and had a security clearance. I thought his
                    Amharic was better than mine. We were splitting interpreting duties, so both of
                    us were invited to the White House for the formal dinner. Since Dr. Minassie was
                    assigned to a table some distance from the Emperor, he could not interpret
                    during the meal for Mrs. Johnson and the Emperor. I handled that task. The Peace
                    Corps fellow sat behind Ras Mesfin and interpreted for him and Assistant
                    Secretary Palmer. As the meal came to an end, either of us were prepared to read
                    our Amharic translation of the President's toast and short speech in honor of
                    the Emperor. In fact, I had worked on the early drafts of the speech and had
                    been asked to provide the White House with some additional historical facts and
                    personal bits of information on the Emperor. We had the final text beforehand
                    and worked with the Ethiopian Embassy to obtain a polished translation. We knew
                    that when the Emperor formally replied to President Johnson's toast, Dr.
                    Minassie would come to the head table and translate it into English. We also had
                    an advance copy of the Emperor's reply and an English translation, just in case.
                    We thought we had everything under control.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>President Johnson stood up and, to our horror, immediately deviated from the
                    text. He began telling a humorous story replete with double meanings and Texas
                    slang. Both of us instantly realized we could not adequately translate that
                    story into Amharic with any pungency or humor. The Peace Corps fellow and I
                    looked at each other in shock and then imploringly to Dr. Minassie. Since the
                    President was speaking, we could not say anything or move. Minassie suddenly
                    stood up at the end of the President's speech and made the Amharic translation.
                    He simply paraphrased the story and concentrated on the substance that followed.
                    Either of us could have done similarly, but we thought we had to translate all
                    of the President's words. As Dr. Minassie was rendering the President's
                    statement into Amharic for the benefit of the Emperor, President Johnson glared
                    at both of us. He expected an American to translate his words! Both of us
                    continued our translation services after the dinner for Ras Mesfin. Minassie
                    stood by the Emperor's side for the rest of the evening.</p>
                <p>I translated the next morning for Ras Mesfin when the Imperial party met for
                    breakfast with the Supreme Court justices. There was nothing that our Supreme
                    Court really needed to talk to the Emperor about, but he wanted to meet them. It
                    was basically a social call. We did talking points for the Chief Justice and
                    suggested that he impress upon the Emperor the independence of our judiciary
                    from the other two branches of government and how this separation of powers was
                    not only in our Constitution, but was an essential element of our country's
                    political core. We hoped the Emperor would note the contrast that the Ethiopian
                    Constitution also called for an independent judiciary appointed by the Emperor,
                    but in fact the judges were controlled by him. The breakfast at the Supreme
                    Court was the last event on the program. The Emperor departed shortly
                    thereafter. Matt Looram and Joseph Palmer thanked me on my contribution to the
                    visit. They both complimented me for the interpreting duties. State Magazine,
                    the Department's monthly news publication carried an article about the visit and
                    mentioned my interpreting. The Director of the School of Languages at the
                    Foreign Service Institute, where I had first begun my study of Amharic,
                    telephoned me to say how pleased and proud he was with the progress of one of
                    his alumni.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the issue of Kagnew Station raised during the
                        visit?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>BUCHE: Yes, it was, but the issue was not discussed in crisis terms. We had
                    expanded Kagnew Station a few years earlier and had what we wanted. The
                    Ethiopians kept talking about the added visibility of our expansion - which was
                    true. The big saucers and dozens of high antennae were quite visible. The
                    Ethiopians spoke to us frequently of how severely they were coming under
                    criticism from other African countries for their “alliance” with the United
                    States, when Africa was supposed to be neutral and alliance- free. The
                    Ethiopians constantly asked for more military and economic assistance in return
                    for our expansion and continued use of Kagnew. We replied with the boilerplate
                    line that there was no connection between Kagnew and any bilateral assistance
                    from the USG, because we paid for Kagnew at a fixed fee in rent (which was
                    ridiculously low, several hundred thousand dollars annually). It was a fiction
                    that both sides maintained. The reality was that we “paid” for Kagnew through
                    our military assistance program. This was an on-going negotiation, and involved
                    not only dollar amounts, but also types of equipment, delivery times, and levels
                    of support. Ambassador Korry tried to reach agreement with the Ethiopians before
                    the visit about the dollar levels, mix, and timing of our military deliveries
                    and economic assistance for the next two years. Since the Emperor was not
                    satisfied, the subject had to be dealt with during the visit. The Emperor spoke
                    to the President about the threats to Ethiopia's security and requested more
                    American assistance. Kagnew was mentioned only obliquely, but everyone in the
                    room knew the connection. The President used the talking points we had prepared
                    and replied along the same lines Korry had used. Johnson offered about the same
                    amount of assistance that Korry had been told would be available. The Emperor
                    was too proud to haggle. He just said that his Minister of Defense would stay
                    behind and work out the details. In the subsequent discussions, we sweetened the
                    pot to a small degree, so that the President would appear responsive to the
                    Emperor's request and to allow the Emperor to believe that his personal plea was
                    effective. The Emperor ended up getting his minimum demand, and we did not
                    exceed our maximum. Both sides knew Kagnew Station was critically important to
                    our security at the time. We also knew the technology was moving very fast and
                    that Kagnew was not going to be as critical in the future as it was then. I had
                    seen intelligence reports at the time indicating that by the mid-1970s,
                    satellites and other means would be able to take over most of Kagnew's
                    functions. In 1967, the station was still a very valuable asset. We did not want
                    to lose it or be thrown out, but if the unthinkable happened, we would not be
                    without possible fallback positions within a few years, as we would have been
                    two or three years earlier. The U.S. Government was looking realistically at an
                    asset that was still critical, but we were not going to be panicked into paying
                    too much. The Emperor and his advisors also sensed that.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>Related to Kagnew and our close relationship with Ethiopia were agreements which
                    dated to the early 1950s. The Ethiopians were asking for renegotiation of the
                    agreements. They had discussed the issue with Ambassador Korry and the MAAG
                    Commander. Both had recommended that we agree to sit down and re-negotiate the
                    agreements. There was a type of status of forces agreement and also a treaty of
                    friendship and commerce which applied to rights of American civilians. Both were
                    very much colonial-type arrangements in which US citizens had some rights of
                    extra-territoriality. The soldiers had full extraterritoriality which meant that
                    they could not be prosecuted by Ethiopian authorities for any offense committed
                    in Ethiopia. There were no horrific, outrageous crimes committed by the soldiers
                    stationed at Kagnew that outraged Ethiopian sensitivities. There was, however,
                    the perception by the Ethiopian authorities that these agreements had been
                    negotiated years ago under quite different circumstances and that it was time to
                    bring them up to date in the face of changing conditions in Ethiopia and Africa.
                    The extraterritoriality section of the friendship and commerce treaty had a
                    provision that American citizens (civilians) could demand that they be tried in
                    an Ethiopian court by judges who met Western educational standards and where
                    Western-type procedures were applied. There was no record that this provision
                    had ever been invoked. In 1966, however, an American citizen in Addis Ababa
                    demanded this right in a dispute over rental payments. He had been arrested and
                    was charged with a crime involving failure to pay rent and trying to leave the
                    country while under a court order. He learned about the extra-territoriality
                    section of the agreement, and in accordance with rights enjoyed by American
                    citizens under the treaty, demanded that he be tried in a court with
                    Western-educated judges. The local court authorities and the persons pressing
                    charges were surprised and outraged, but the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and
                    Justice upheld the validity and interpretation of the agreement. Since there was
                    no way the local court could comply, the American was free to leave the country.
                    (The facts of the case were suspicious from the beginning. The man claimed he
                    had paid the rent each month as it was due and that the receipts for about a
                    year's rent had been stolen from his home by the landlord a few weeks before his
                    scheduled departure from Ethiopia.)</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>The U.S. Government was currently involved in re-negotiating status-of-forces
                    agreements in Europe and Asia, and so the idea was not unacceptable. We told the
                    Emperor we would be prepared to re-negotiate the agreements. The negotiations
                    were actually done in Addis Ababa by the Embassy and the MAAG under instructions
                    sent from Washington. We would have preferred to have the negotiations in
                    Washington with the Ethiopian Embassy and a team of specialists from Addis
                    Ababa. The lack of adequate communications capabilities between the Embassy and
                    Addis Ababa and the dearth of Ethiopian legal officials who could be spared for
                    the long negotiations made this a non-starter. Soon after the visit, actual
                    negotiations began. I was asked by Matt Looram to be the point man for AF/NE.
                    The negotiations lasted about six months. In Washington, we developed a
                    mini-team in the Department and in the International Security Affairs
                    Directorate of the Department of Defense to coordinate our responses to the
                    on-going discussions in Addis Ababa. After receiving a telegram from Addis Ababa
                    reporting the latest state of play, I would confer with my counterpart in DOD,
                    Lt. Colonel Kennedy. (Years later I worked closely with him again when he was
                    the U.S. Representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency.) We would
                    follow up on the recommendations from Korry and obtain the necessary
                    concurrences from the lawyers and policy makers in State and DOD. I would draft
                    instructions to the Embassy, in effect telling them that Washington had approved
                    their proposed plan of action and the wording we wanted them to use. Sheldon
                    Vance was a lawyer, and there may have been a lawyer on the staff of the MAAG,
                    but the Embassy depended on the legal expertise of Washington for exact
                    terminology. We reached an agreement that satisfied both sides. The main change
                    in the status of forces agreement was to acknowledge (with some safeguards) that
                    if an American soldier committed a crime that was not related to the performance
                    of official duties, the Ethiopian authorities would have jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>There were continuing disagreements with the Ethiopians on the levels and
                    composition of our military assistance package and regarding our economic
                    assistance. That was the background for another visit by the Emperor in July
                    1969.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: It was called an official visit and touched on similar issues raised in
                    the 1967 visit. In 1969, however, Kagnew was less important to us. The DOD and
                    NSA had already begun to picture a phasing-out of Kagnew Station, something that
                    many of us in 1967 did not realize was moving that fast. We were aware of plans
                    in 1967 for a probable phasing-down of Kagnew Station in the mid-1970s, but not
                    a phasing-out. Satellite technology and reliability had progressed so fast that
                    the technicians and budgeters in DOD and NSA were beginning to advocate a phase
                    out within five to seven years. Kagnew was an expensive operation. The cost of
                    transporting and maintaining 4,000 Americans in northern Ethiopia, plus the
                    payments to the Ethiopians, was in the hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And there is always the drag on relations when you have
                        military installation in a foreign country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: There were big problems for both sides. Kagnew was an embarrassment for
                    the Ethiopians, and they received a lot of criticism from Africans, the
                    non-aligned group (the so-called G-77), and the Soviets. The university students
                    used Kagnew to attack the Emperor as a lackey of America. The Eritrean
                    insurgency was gaining momentum. We did not know whether the Eritrean Liberation
                    Front would decide to attack American military personnel, blow up some antennae,
                    or lob a mortar round into one of the parabolic dishes. The ELF was certainly
                    capable of doing all of the above. There was no feasible way to defend Kagnew.
                    The station was by 1969 a useful, but declining asset, yet, the Ethiopians were
                    upping their demands. Whereas four or five years earlier, if they figuratively
                    pounded on the table and said “We've got to have this or else”, we would have
                    tried to see how to work it out. We did add a little extra in 1967, but in 1969,
                    we told the Emperor in very polite language that what we had offered was final.
                    And we meant it! The Kagnew equation had changed significantly. On the other
                    hand, if the Ethiopians had come forward with a well-reasoned request, we might
                    have once again added a little sweetener. There were some extra funds available.
                    The Emperor, however, despite the Embassy's advice, asked for an aircraft
                    carrier! President Nixon explained that the upkeep would consume almost half of
                    the Ministry of Defense's budget to maintain the ship. We knew where this absurd
                    idea had originated, from the Commander of the Imperial Navy, the Emperor's
                    grandson, Iskinder Desta. The Emperor lost many points in Washington over that
                    request. He also asked for some advanced planes. We were talking about providing
                    more F-5s, but the Emperor was pushing for something newer and more
                    sophisticated. (I do not think that the US Air Force ever used F-5s, although
                    they were reportedly sturdy and reliable planes.)</p>
                <p>Q: No, they were so-called “Freedom Fighters.” They were a low-maintenance,
                    pretty good plane, but they were given to countries other than NATO countries, I
                    believe.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>BUCHE: We had promised the Ethiopians some more F-5's, and their potential
                    enemies were the Somalis, who did not have anything as good. (The Somalis had
                    some old MIG's, but the F-5's were superior.) The Ethiopians were not pleased
                    with our response. We were becoming more concerned about the insurgency in
                    Eritrea and in the Ogaden and the effects on the stability of the Ethiopian
                    Empire. We were also concerned about the safety of our 400 plus Peace Corps
                    Volunteers scattered throughout the country. The numbers were down from the peak
                    of 500. We agreed to tell His Imperial Majesty in response to his anticipated
                    request for a substantial increase, that we thought it advisable to reduce our
                    numbers of volunteers. Our briefing papers for the Peace Corps Director, Joseph
                    Blatchford, were written in conjunction with his staff. They carried the message
                    along the lines of “Your Imperial Majesty, Ethiopia is now at a point where your
                    educational system is graduating large numbers of well-trained teachers who can
                    go into secondary schools. There are talented potential teachers who need jobs.
                    It does not make any sense for us to send over PCV's to fill teaching positions
                    in your secondary schools in the provinces, when your own people can do the
                    job.” That was buttering the sandwich in such a way that national pride should
                    have kicked in, but the Emperor saw it quite differently. He persisted in asking
                    for around 200 additional positions for new Volunteers, while we were talking
                    about cutting back some 100, by not replacing them when they finished their
                    contract. So there was no meeting of the minds on that issue either.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>I should have mentioned earlier that we had a new Ambassador in Ethiopia, William
                    Hall. He had come from the Agency for International Development (AID).
                    Ambassador Korry was asked by President Nixon to serve as Ambassador to Chile.
                    It is the responsibility of the Desk to prepare a new ambassador for the post.
                    We worked closely with Bill to explain what we were trying to accomplish in
                    Ethiopia and why we were having problems. Bill had vast experience in working
                    with developing countries. He was easy to work with and seemed to take a real
                    interest in people. Both Jack Gloster and I spent many hours briefing him on the
                    problems he would face in Ethiopia. The old idea of strengthening the Ethiopian
                    Ministry of Finance to enable it to serve as a fulcrum for reform and
                    modernization was once again being discussed. Bill Hall was intrigued with the
                    idea and convinced his colleagues in AID to come up with potential funds to make
                    it possible. The World Bank was also more favorably disposed toward the idea
                    than previously. There was now a chance to put some money behind our
                    exhortations. We worked with Bill and his AID colleagues to devise a plan for
                    him to present to the Emperor. We also had advice from the Bank, as well as
                    discreet input via our Embassy from several Ethiopian officials (U.S.-trained
                    economists). The concept was simple, but to achieve acceptance would take great
                    insights and skill on the part of Ambassador-designate Hall. We finally worked
                    out a half dozen reform measures for the Ministry. If the Emperor accepted them,
                    we would respond with extra development funds. We knew it would not happen all
                    at once, so we came up with milestones, which when reached would trigger the
                    release of a certain amount of funds. What we were advocating was for the
                    Emperor to allow the laws and regulations on taxation which he had promulgated
                    to be carried out by the Ministry without interference and intervention from the
                    Palace in favor of powerful friends and allies. Government receipts would
                    thereby increase substantially. We also advocated a reorganization of the
                    Ministry, including more auditors and modern equipment. Jack and I warned Hall
                    that the Emperor would not reject outright the “sticks”, and would thus expect
                    the “carrots” immediately. Hall assured us he understood the conditions.
                    Implementation, not promises alone, would bring the added funds. This was a
                    point our Ethiopian reformer “allies” had repeatedly stressed. They also told us
                    they would arrange some informal get-togethers for Hall with other like-minded
                    reformers. Some of the reformist leaders were Bulcha Demeksa (Minister of
                    Finance), Teferri Berhane (lawyer in private practice), Wondwossen Mengesha
                    (National Bank), and Dr. Mengesha (Development Bank). Don Paradis (an American
                    lawyer in the Prime Minister's Office had some practical advice to offer.)</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>Ambassador Hall prepared the groundwork carefully and spoke to the Emperor about
                    the concept. Haile Selassie was so clever. He thanked Hall and said he welcomed
                    the advice and would consider the proposals. HIM told Hall how difficult such a
                    move would be, especially since it was widely known to be from the Americans. It
                    would be better to allow the Ethiopians to work out their own reforms. The
                    Emperor told Hall that he was constantly reforming Ethiopia's institutions and
                    would, of course, give attention to the Ministry of Finance. He let it be known
                    that an early release of the extra funds would help him to overcome the expected
                    difficulties. We had anticipated this response, so Hall offered funds to
                    purchase new equipment for the Ministry. (This was only a small portion of the
                    package.) The reform proposals were dead, but the Ethiopian Government pressed
                    hard for the rest of our funds. The Department held firm, but the Ambassador was
                    caught in the middle. The Ethiopian Government was in deep financial and
                    political difficulties and threatened to backslide on other development projects
                    of interest to the U.S. The Embassy began pleading for a relaxation of our
                    original strategy. Eventually, Washington gave in. There was no real reform of
                    the Ministry of Finance in Haile Selassie's time.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, how about the Ethiopian Embassy? Was it sort of the same ilk as you
                    found the Ethiopian Government, that they could not play much of a role because
                    everything came from the Emperor?</p>
                <p>BUCHE: Yes, the Embassy was seldom told by the Foreign Ministry what was
                    happening within the Government. We got nothing of value from them. If we did
                    not tell them what was going on in Addis, they would have been in the dark. We
                    liked the Ambassador and his staff and felt sorry they were kept out of the loop
                    by their Government, so we kept them informed of what our Embassy was
                    negotiating or what we were discussing in Addis Ababa with the Government. They
                    had their own private sources on internal developments in Ethiopia, but what I
                    was trying to keep them informed about were official negotiations and what was
                    happening between our Government and their own.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you dealing with a new breed of Ethiopian student who was getting trained
                    in the United States, and were you finding some staying on here in Washington
                    and calling for the removal of the Emperor and all that?</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>BUCHE: That was a new thing, yes, because traditionally every Ethiopian student,
                    except I think maybe one or two, went back to Ethiopia after he or she trained
                    in the United States. There were more and more who were staying in the United
                    States. They just did not want to go back to their homeland, where everything
                    was, in their opinion, medieval and backward. They wanted to stay here for
                    various reasons: jobs, personal relationships, better living conditions, fear of
                    retribution for their political activities, etc. Others made the decision to
                    stay to develop an anti-monarchist movement. They were hooking up with their
                    compatriots in France, Germany, Canada, England, and Italy. There were also ties
                    with Ethiopian students in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Ethiopians are
                    usually not terribly good at organizing, but they had some sort of umbrella
                    Ethiopian Students Association. It was a loose association, but the message was
                    consistent: Ethiopia is ruled by a corrupt, feudal government, a creation of the
                    Emperor and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church; the government oppresses the people;
                    the government must be overthrown. The students also accused the Ethiopian
                    Government of being subservient to the U.S.A. (Kagnew!). I met with Ethiopian
                    students informally. Unlike in Addis Ababa, I did not arrange parties at our
                    apartment. We usually met in restaurants or at student conferences/meetings held
                    at several of the local universities. I listened to what they had to say and did
                    not feel it was my duty to defend the Emperor. When the subject of
                    U.S.-Ethiopian relations came up, I told them the facts and let them draw their
                    own conclusions. Needless to say, few of the students had bothered to check the
                    accuracy of their assertions regarding the levels and mix of our military or
                    economic assistance, how many MAAG personnel (several told me there were over
                    2,000; usual number was under 100!), or whether there were “tanks and cannons”
                    in Kagnew (there were no weapons heavier than rifles!). There was the wide
                    belief that most of the PCV's were CIA agents, especially those teaching at the
                    University. Another widely-held, but factually erroneous belief was that an
                    American company had discovered oil in the Ogaden, but kept this a secret from
                    the Ethiopian Government in order to avoid paying royalties. The company
                    allegedly had made a deal with Mogadiscio and was waiting for the Somalis to
                    take over the Ogaden and in return would not have to pay as much! The students
                    were so opposed to the Emperor and to any assistance to the Ethiopian Government
                    (it props up the Emperor!), that the U.S.A. was also an object of their scorn.
                    Some students saw us as the main obstacle to their crusade to get rid of the
                    Emperor. There was no longer talk about the Emperor in a reduced-power role as a
                    titular head of state a la Great Britain, Belgium, Sweden, et al. The students
                    made Haile Selassie their bogeyman; he had to go! With such a mindset, it was
                    easy for them to ignore facts or to put irrational spins on events. Our
                    conversations about the U.S. role and influence in Ethiopia would often run
                    along the following lines: I would point out that Ethiopia usually voted in the
                    UN General Assembly against the U.S. position. They would reply that the UNGA
                    was just a sideshow. Yes, Ethiopia votes often against the U.S. (Ethiopia voted
                    together with the African bloc or the G-77), but that is not what really counts.
                    What really counts is that you have a base out there along with combat troops.
                    You are backing up the Emperor. Your corporations are given sweetheart deals.
                    You have an American in the Prime Minister's office. You have military officers
                    throughout the country. You have placed Peace Corps Volunteers in all the key
                    ministries and the University to spy on us. You control the University. You
                    exploit our natural resources. You have everything under lock and key. So what
                    does it really matter if Ethiopia votes with the G-77 against something that the
                    United States is pushing in the General Assembly? What does the General Assembly
                    count anyway, because you have the Security Council under your control?</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>Since the students were passionate about their cause, they really were not
                    interested in examining the logic or veracity of their various assertions. I
                    came to realize I could not make any impression on them or change their view.
                    What struck me was the vehemence of their expressions of hatred for the Emperor.
                    They saw him as the embodiment of all that was wrong (in their minds) in
                    Ethiopia. There, of course, were some exaggeration and posturing, but also some
                    very strong feelings. There were undoubtedly also students in the Washington
                    area who did not share such revolutionary desires, but I do not recall speaking
                    with any.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Vietnam War playing any role in what we were doing
                        therwith the Ethiopian Government or the students or anything else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: The Ethiopian elite generally were against our involvement in Vietnam. It
                    was not a passionate issue with them, however. Even with the students, Vietnam
                    was not a high priority. They had many other grievances on their agenda. They
                    had a demonstration at the American Embassy, but I vaguely recall that it was
                    small and more ritualistic than angry. There were a few signs and a banner with
                    something like “America out of Vietnam”. Ambassador Korry met them on the steps
                    of the Embassy and offered them lemonade and invited the leaders to come inside
                    and discuss the issue. After a while, they all marched back down the hill to the
                    University. There may have been some other demonstrations after I was on the
                    Desk. I can not recall. None of them apparently were big enough to make any
                    impression on me or to prompt an immediate or NIACT (night-action) cable saying
                    the Embassy was being besieged by angry demonstrators. Several times the Embassy
                    was instructed to approach the Ethiopian Government for some diplomatic support
                    at an OAU or UNGA meeting on the subject of Vietnam. If they could not support
                    us, could they at least not join in the attack. The Emperor usually would tell
                    the Ambassador that Ethiopia would have to go along with the majority, but would
                    try to soften the condemnatory language. An issue that seemed on the surface to
                    have very little to do directly with Vietnam was the perennial vote in the UNGA
                    and other venues on Puerto Rico. The Ethiopians, however, knew how important
                    this issue was to the U.S.A. They often would tell us that they would balance
                    their vote on Vietnam with an abstention or possibly a favorable vote when
                    Puerto Rico came up. They knew how to play an issue that was important to us and
                    to them meant very little. They were masters at this.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: I went to Northwestern University to do a year in African studies, one of
                    the most fascinating years I had ever spent in my life, because that was when
                    the Vietnam protests began hitting the campuses.</p>

                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is the 30th of August, 1999. John, you went to Northwestern.You were at
                    Northwestern from when to when?</p>
                <p>BUCHE: From September of 1969 to June of 1970. It was part of the training
                    program funded by the Foreign Service Institute for professional study outside
                    of Washington. The African Bureau had two or three slots each year allotted by
                    Personnel. The Bureau could choose candidates for a year of university training
                    in African studies in conjunction with Personnel and the Foreign Service
                    Institute. There were probably at the time five or six quite good African
                    studies departments. I wanted to go to Northwestern University because I knew
                    the head of the African studies program, Professor Gwendolyn Carter, and several
                    Ethiopian scholars at that university and one also at the University of Illinois
                    in Chicago, as well as several at Chicago University. Several of the foremost
                    American scholars in Ethiopian sociology/anthropology, Donald Levine and William
                    Shack, were at Chicago University. There was a cooperative program in the
                    Chicago metropolis, so by enrolling at Northwestern, I could have access to the
                    two other campuses.</p>
                <p>Q: Before we talk about unrest on the campus, what about the courses? What were
                    you getting out of them and what was the spirit of the times from the academic
                    point of view about whither Africa?</p>
                <p>BUCHE: At the time, Africa was still in the ascendancy, with evident optimism in
                    the faculties. It was an exciting time, although some of the bloom had really
                    come off the African rose itself. I do not think that was yet noticeable in the
                    various African studies programs. For one thing, tons of money were flowing in
                    from foundations to help universities to set up African studies programs.
                    Corporations were also giving. There was the black studies movement also taking
                    root at many universities. Although these were distinct programs, there was some
                    money which was, I think, sloshing around that was available for both. There was
                    a keen interest in African studies because that discipline was underrepresented
                    on most American campuses until the late 1950s. The traditional schools of
                    African studies were in France and England, for obvious reasons.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The students who were there, was it all graduate, or were
                        therundergraduates?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: I was, of course, on the graduate side, but there were some courses that
                    were open to juniors and seniors. What struck me very soon after arriving on
                    campus was a predisposition among the students and some of the faculty to see
                    Africa almost exclusively as good and positive. That did not correspond to the
                    reality of what I had experienced, although I was pretty much restricted to
                    Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia, and to a small extent, Kenya. I had done some
                    traveling, but my professional responsibilities were in the northeastern part of
                    Africa. Both in Addis Ababa and on the Desk, I had access to cables from our
                    embassies throughout the entire Continent and made it a point to read or at
                    least scan many of them on a daily basis.. I avidly read the U.S. Government's
                    research on African issues as well as scholarly publications, so I think I had a
                    good underpinning on what was happening in contemporary Africa and where things
                    were probably heading. Regarding Ethiopia, I was confident I understood the
                    country better than anyone on campus (except the Ethiopians). In 1969, we were
                    at the height of the Cold War, and it had spilled over to Africa. There was a
                    new dimension in the struggle for influence and power on the Continent because
                    the Chinese were involved for the first time in a major way.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you sort of seem like the skunk at the wedding when in a class or seminar
                    you commented on someone's contribution with “Well, that's all very nice, but
                    what I observed was...?</p>
                <p>BUCHE: Well, I had been very well briefed by the Foreign Service Institute. I was
                    told campuses are currently quite different from when I had graduated fifteen
                    years earlier, so I was somewhat prepared for the level of knowledge of the
                    students as well as the prevailing animus against the U.S. Government. The
                    students and faculty knew that I was a Foreign Service Officer, had served in
                    Addis Ababa and had come directly from the African Bureau, and that I was going
                    to return to the African Bureau. I think I had shared with some that I had an
                    assignment, at least on paper, to Hargeisa, in northern Somalia. Professor
                    Carter invited me to join several faculty discussions on Ethiopia. I wanted to
                    make Ethiopian studies my area of specialization, so I took several courses
                    involving Ethiopia, Somalia, and Kenya, either at Northwestern or at the
                    University of Chicago. At the insistence of my major professor, Gwendolyn
                    Carter, who had made her career on South Africa, I also took two courses on that
                    country. If I presented a paper and people criticized some aspects, I accepted
                    it as part of the learning process. I thought I defended my positions pretty
                    well. I received all A's, except from a visiting Oxford professor, and she gave
                    me a B+, the highest grade in her seminar.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>I certainly did not flaunt my knowledge or experience or deliberately embarrass
                    someone, but if a student said something I knew to be factually incorrect or
                    drew conclusions that did not stand rational scrutiny, I addressed the point in
                    class, but after a few weeks, I decided it was better to discuss it in private
                    afterwards, so I made the decision not to criticize in class. I was really
                    astounded at the factual errors many of the students were making in their papers
                    or in discussions, but I soon realized how much more experience I had in African
                    (and other political or economic) issues. I had such an advantage over the
                    students. Even the graduate students lacked experience in Africa. Several had
                    three months' experience in Crossroads Africa, but they were the exception.
                    There was not a single PCV with African experience among the graduate students
                    in my classes. The graduate students, almost without exception, came to
                    Northwestern directly after completing their undergraduate degrees. (They could
                    avoid the draft in that fashion.) I do not think many of them majored in African
                    studies as undergraduates. It hit me that I was sitting in class competing
                    against them, skewing the grading curve. I made a special effort to reach out to
                    them. We had many discussions in the African Studies Lounge over coffee and
                    doughnuts. Within a month, some of the students came to me individually and
                    asked me to critique their papers before they handed them in. From then on, my
                    relations with the students were very positive.</p>
                <p>In one class, however, I was the midget and my student colleagues were the
                    giants, because I was taking a course called African Geography and Spatial
                    Problems in Economic Development. I thought this was something that I wanted to
                    learn more about, African geography from an academic point of view. It turned
                    out to be a class quite different than what I had imagined. We used Africa as
                    the geographic reference-point. The purpose of the course, however, was to
                    explore how economic development in designated areas (districts, provinces,
                    regions, entire countries) theoretically could be stimulated (or held back) by
                    the choice of investments and their relative costs in various
                    geographically-specific objects: building bridges, roads, river-lake-or-sea
                    ports, airports, etc. It was a computer-based course on quantifying the ratio of
                    geographic or man-made structures in a designated area, for example, length of
                    road network (all-weather or dry-season only), the number of road intersections,
                    airports, etc. to various types of economic indicators: road traffic, filling
                    stations, tonnage hauled, tax receipts, land values, building permits,
                    population growth, etc. The class used transportation variables at different
                    inputted costs under various geographic conditions (Sahel, central Ghana,
                    northern Malawi, Gabon, etc.) and related them to actual examples. Some
                    knowledge of computer-based modeling was essential.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>After the first session, I wanted to drop the course. I had no experience with
                    computers, much less computer modeling. I spoke with the young visiting
                    professor about dropping the course. He convinced me to remain. He assured me
                    that if I studied hard and also audited a concurrent course in computer modeling
                    for geographic problems (also taught by him), I would do just fine. He repeated
                    that he knew very little about Africa and the choice of that continent for the
                    course was to familiarize him with a new region. (The course previously had been
                    based on the Australian outback and southwest USA. The object of the course was
                    to teach a methodology which theoretically was universally applicable with the
                    appropriate modifications.) He knew I had experience in Africa and asked me to
                    reconsider my decision to drop out. He told me I could help him and the class
                    with my experience to make the presentation more realistic. The clincher,
                    however, was his promise to give me tutorials if I found myself falling behind.
                    I agreed to stay, but it was a struggle, especially to complete my class
                    project. I chose an area in Ethiopia, where the Wonji Sugar Company was located.
                    There was abundant reference material (feasibility studies and annual reports)
                    available through the World Bank, the Ethiopian Development Bank, and the Dutch
                    parent company, HVA.</p>
                <p>But going back to your original query, did I feel that I was the skunk at the
                    wedding party? I think to some extent, both yes and no. Yes because I was more
                    experienced and grabbed the top grade in all my classes, and no because I used
                    that experience to help other students. I realized that some of the students did
                    not want to be helped by me. That was fine with me. Others had enough sense and
                    confidence to ask for my assistance, so I helped them. The professors really
                    welcomed my presence in their classes. I was invited to faculty teas, and I
                    lectured a few times. I was asked by University of Chicago Professor Shack to
                    come over and take a particular course on Ethiopia and to serve as a resource.
                    His specialty was the Gurage ethnic group. He was half way through his field
                    research in Ethiopia about the time I arrived in country. Whenever he came to
                    Addis Ababa, he looked me up, and once I spent several days with him in Gurage
                    country. I respected his work. I was delighted at his invitation. The University
                    of Chicago is much different from Northwestern University. The level of students
                    (all grad students) in the classes I took were usually older, more experienced,
                    and a higher quality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the University of Chicago, as with many city
                        universities, attracts working people and more mature students, I would have
                        thought.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: They were more mature, and they were better. They just were a different
                    breed of students. The University had an exceptional department for studies on
                    the Horn of Africa. They had Shack anLevine, who wrote a classic on Amhara
                    thought processes. They also had a Polish scholar in Somali studies and two
                    visiting Ethiopian professors, one of whom was Dr. Kifle who did a seminal study
                    of the Oromo gada system (age- based cultural/career stages). There was also
                    another FSO from the African Bureau studying at the University of Chicago, Len
                    Schurtleff. So during the second semester, I took several of my classes at the
                    University of Chicago.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>One other thing I wanted to mention was that it was an extraordinary time to be
                    at a major American campus. Student protests against American involvement in
                    Vietnam were at their peak. There were not only demonstrations at Northwestern
                    against U.S. policy in Vietnam, but there were protests against the U.S.
                    Government in general. Largely as a carry-over from opposition to our Vietnam
                    policy, there was a palpable feeling of distrust and suspicion, if not anger and
                    hatred, toward Washington. There was an institute on campus called the Highway
                    Safety Institute. It was to a large extent federally-funded. They performed
                    research, as the name implied, on highway safety, from the design and siting
                    aspects. They were highly theoretical and used computers for simulation,
                    plotting, analysis, etc. My geography professor was associated with the
                    Institute. The Institute dated back to the era when the interstate system was
                    being constructed. One night pamphlets were tossed around the campus alleging
                    that the Institute was engaged in secret work (unspecified) for the Federal
                    Government. The Institute replied that all its research was unclassified and
                    that students or the public were welcome to visit and to discuss its work. The
                    students were not convinced, and there were protest marches and demands for the
                    University to close the Institute. The University administration met with
                    student delegations, but refused to close the Institute. The student rhetoric
                    became threatening. Then one night the Institute was fire-bombed. One of the
                    researchers was injured. There were “victory” celebrations the next day on
                    campus, since one link in the “industrial-military complex” was destroyed. There
                    were demonstrations on black power, as well as demonstrations supporting the
                    right of black students to have their own exclusive dormitories and the demand
                    to prohibit whites from teaching black studies. And then came the bombing of
                    Cambodia, in the -</p>

                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>BUCHE: Yes, in May 1970. That led to the further eruption of campus unrest. There
                    were constant rallies, and to go from one building to another for class, I had
                    to push through the crowds of students. The University of Chicago was a little
                    bit quieter, and I was glad that I was doing some commuting to that campus. I
                    did not run away from the demonstrations. I liked to talk to the student
                    protestors. We sometimes had breaks between seminars of an hour, so I had plenty
                    of opportunity. The African Studies building was on the edge of the campus, so
                    it was a good spot to meet. It was a former residence that was turned into an
                    office complex. There was a comfortable lounge, and the staff had coffee and
                    usually cookies or doughnuts available for the students. I could see that there
                    were definitely deep emotions involved within the student protestors. Still,
                    some of their statements to me in the relative calm of the Lounge were absurd.
                    These were college students and supposedly capable of a rational thought
                    process. They were picking up wild rumors and believing them. They seemed to
                    believe almost anything said in condemnation of the Federal Government. I cannot
                    recall the details of the wild, irrational statements by the students, but they
                    were along the line that the FBI had set up several concentration camps
                    somewhere in the southwestern states and had rounded up thousands of student
                    protestors and incarcerated them or that the CIA was engaged in abducting and
                    torturing/murdering student leaders throughout the USA. I recall (vaguely) a
                    conversation with one of my graduate student colleagues about Ethiopia. She was
                    protesting against something entirely unrelated, but stopped in the lounge for a
                    break. She saw me and decided to clue me in on what was really happening in
                    Ethiopia. This was in spring 1970, a relatively calm period in Addis Ababa. She
                    went on and on about the almost daily murders of the university students by the
                    secret police, the concentration camps for the students, the wide-spread
                    executions of political prisoners, etc. I asked her sources for such news, and
                    her reply was something like everyone in Ethiopia knows what is really
                    happening. I tried to reason with her that what she was telling me was not true.
                    Student murders, concentration camps, and wide-spread executions would be picked
                    up by the foreign press in Ethiopia pretty quickly, especially if such things
                    were “well-known”. She remained adamant. I remember telling her I would be
                    pleased to call up my colleague on the Ethiopian Desk, David Shinn, to see
                    whether there were any new developments in Ethiopia regarding what she had
                    described. Her answer was that the U.S. Government was also involved in the
                    murders. At that point, I realized there was nothing I could say that would
                    convince her otherwise. I mention the stories to give an example of how the
                    turmoil and chaos on the campus from the Vietnam protests so affected some of
                    the students' emotions that they began to think (and act) irrationally. I was
                    also simply amazed at some of the things some of the students were proclaiming
                    about life and society in the Soviet Union. Such statements about happy peasants
                    and industrial workers and the upcoming liberation of Africa by the Soviet Union
                    from the neo-colonial West. They thought it was a terrible lie what we were
                    saying in our propaganda about Soviet society, since it was far superior to our
                    own. The Soviet workers all had jobs, health care, their children had day-care
                    centers, and there were wonderful places for the workers to spend vacations,
                    cheaply and comfortably. There were no ghettos, no discrimination, and no
                    exploitation in the Soviet Union. I usually asked my interlocutors whether they
                    had visited or lived in the U.S.S.R. or whether they were basing their
                    statements on others' reports. None of them had visited, but they claimed they
                    had received the information from friends or trusted sources. I told them that
                    what they were saying was completely at odds from what I had heard and read.
                    Some responded that I had been brainwashed; the others probably suspected it. I
                    had many discussions with students on non-classroom subjects such as the above.
                    I doubt whether I influenced their opinions. They were just too wound up
                    emotionally because of Vietnam and other issues to be in the mood for rational
                    debate.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>At the end of my year on campus, I was supposed to write a report for the Foreign
                    Service Institute. My first comment was that when another FSO prepares to attend
                    Northwestern University, labeling it a “conservative campus” during the
                    orientation might send the wrong signal. I suggested that the FSI alert the
                    officer who would come after me that even on a conservative campus such as NU,
                    he or she could expect to receive severe criticism from students on a wide
                    variety of perceived evils in our foreign policy. It was not meant to be
                    personal, but an officer of the State Department would be a lightning rod on
                    campus when students were angry over foreign policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in 1970, where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: I was supposed to go, as I mentioned, to Hargeisa, Somalia, but in a
                    cost-cutting exercise the Department closed the post. I think Anike was
                    relieved, since we had two adopted infants by the time I completed my studies at
                    Northwestern. Our son, John, was born in 1968, and our daughter, Christina, was
                    born in 1969, both in November. Anike was understandably concerned about the
                    health conditions and medical facilities for the children in Hargeisa. I had
                    been there several times from Ethiopia, and was familiar with the city. It was
                    the former capital of British Somaliland and had about 40,000 residents and one
                    hospital. There was a Consulate located in Hargeisa. The Peace Corps had a
                    program in northern Somalia, so there was a resident Peace Corps doctor and
                    nurse for the Volunteers. There was also an office of the Agency for
                    International Development with two American officers. I was scheduled to be the
                    resident Consul. I had heard from David Shinn that Hargeisa was likely to be
                    closed, but until the closing was official, I could not bid for another posting.
                    David kept me informed about possible job openings in Africa. Since I had
                    benefitted from a year of African studies at the university, it was logical that
                    I seek a posting on that continent. David called me one day to ask whether I
                    would be interested in going to Blantyre, Malawi as the Deputy Chief of
                    Mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Go where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Blantyre, Malawi. At that time it was the capital. I wadelighted, so that
                    is where I was assigned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were in Malawi from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: I arrived in August of 1970, and stayed two years to Augus1972.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To 1972?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>BUCHE: Yes, 1972. I guess we could get started on what Malawi was like. The
                    position suddenly came open because the DCM, Chips Chester, resigned to take a
                    job on Capitol Hill. I was without an assignment, so I went to Blantyre. It was
                    a post in a country that on the surface was just as pleasant as one could
                    imagine in Africa - beautiful temperate weather, fertile soil, a mixture of
                    cultivated fields, savanna, and forests, nice rolling hills, some mountains, a
                    large lake, excellent housing, decent medical facilities, and apparent peace and
                    calm. Blantyre was named after a place in Scotland. It was the de-facto capital
                    after independence in 1962. (Zomba, the colonial capital, still had the
                    President's official residence, several ministries, and the British High
                    Commission.) The President at the independence celebrations announced that the
                    new capital would be built in the Central Region of the country, at Lilongwe,
                    near his native village.) Hastings Kamuzu Banda was the President. The Malawi
                    CongressParty was the only political organization permitted; Banda was
                    Chairman.</p>
                <p>After gaining absolute power in a show down with several opposing Ministers in
                    his cabinet, Banda arranged to be elected President-for-Life. Banda went around
                    in three-piece well-tailored suits and a homburg. He idolized many aspects of
                    British culture, excluding their ideals of democracy and fair play. He was a
                    tyrant and a dictator, who had peculiar ideas and hang-ups, and who tolerated no
                    deviation or criticism. He used Israeli-trained thugs, the “Young Pioneers,” as
                    his enforcers throughout the country. There were contingents of Young Pioneers
                    at every level of Malawian society. They served as informers and also had the
                    power to arrest. They were loathed and feared by most elements of society,
                    including the army, police, bureaucracy, clergy, politicians, merchants,
                    peasants, et al. They were akin to the Ton-Ton Macoutes of Duvalier's Haiti.
                    While the Young Pioneers were as ubiquitous as the Stasi, there was at least a
                    highly-centralized command and control structure in East Germany. The Young
                    Pioneers swore absolute fealty and obedience to H. Kamuzu Banda, but in their
                    day-to-day activities, they were often unsupervised. They often used their power
                    to bully, to extort, or to seek revenge for personal ends.</p>
                <p>The judicial system was controlled by Banda, so there was seldom any protection
                    in the courts for those accused of “disloyalty” to him. “Disloyalty” was one of
                    the most serious offenses in Malawi. The definition of “disloyalty” was whatever
                    the President or his circle decided. Persons accused of disloyalty were not
                    brought to trial. Some simply disappeared without trace; a few big names were
                    killed in suspicious “traffic accidents”; many perished while trying “to escape”
                    from detention; others languished in prison until disease or “accidents” snuffed
                    out their lives. There was a reign of terror in Malawi. Malawians were afraid
                    and very careful about what they could say, and not just the government
                    employees or politicians, but even the household servants, taxi drivers,
                    waiters, retail clerks, et al. Completely off-limits was any criticism, even the
                    slightest joke, about President-for-Life Banda. Being overheard by the wrong
                    person could be fatal.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>Banda, however, was not widely criticized in the West and in other African
                    nations because of his brutal oppression of internal dissent. He was lambasted
                    because of the open trade and diplomatic relationship with South Africa. Banda
                    was widely ridiculed and lampooned externally because of his 1970 edict that all
                    females over six years of age in the country had to wear skirts or wrap-arounds
                    that extended beyond the calves of their legs. No repeat no slacks were
                    permitted, except for Indians and Pakistanis when dressing in their native
                    costume. What a woman wore or did not wear above her waist was immaterial to
                    Banda.</p>
                <p>Banda was really serious about his dress code. Dozens of foreign women were
                    expelled or refused entry into the country if they were caught “inappropriately”
                    dressed. There was no immunity for the diplomatic corps. The wives and daughters
                    of the diplomats, plus any female diplomats, had to abandon their normal mode of
                    dress and buy long skirts. They were not pleased with that, but there was no
                    alternative. The wife of the Zambian Ambassador was declared personna non grata
                    after being observed on a picnic caught in slacks. Since she was not East Asian,
                    she was in contravention of the code. An elderly Baptist missionary from South
                    Carolina was seen on the Mission compound (by a Young Pioneer) carrying a broom,
                    mop, and bucket from her house to the next-door neighbor's. She had completely
                    forgotten about the ban. She was expelled, despite my representations for
                    leniency to the official in charge of the Young Pioneers, Albert Muwalo.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the Malawians were willing to talk about their customs,
                    geography, sociology, or history, as long as there was no mention of current
                    politics. One exceptional and positive aspect of life in Malawi in the early
                    1970s was the small amount of corruption in the financial sense, as was
                    traditionally practiced in the rest of Africa. In other words, payments were
                    receipted. If you were stopped for a traffic violation, the policeman would give
                    you a ticket and file an account, but he did not collect the money. One could
                    argue the matter with the policeman, but offering a bribe would have been a big
                    mistake. Taxes were collected in a relatively objective manner by a
                    well-trained, closely-monitored bureaucracy. Funds from foreign governments or
                    international organizations for economic development projects were scrupulously
                    accounted for. The Embassy managed two major economic development projects, the
                    construction of a 110 kilometer (69 miles) road and a technical-training program
                    at U.S. universities for future teachers.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>The Embassy also ran a micro-development program that annually approved twenty to
                    twenty-five small “self-help” projects submitted by committees or groups of
                    elders in rural areas for additional classrooms, teachers' houses,
                    cattle-dipping tanks, or clinics. The self-help requests were first vetted by
                    the Malawi Government Development Office to ensure internal coordination with
                    the appropriate ministries. The USG donated funds to cover imported materials
                    (windows, tin roofing, plumbing, etc.) and the local people provided labor,
                    cement, lumber, etc. Our contributions were about $5,000 per self-help project.
                    The accounting on the Malawian side for both the two large projects and the
                    self-help grants was detailed and accurate. Our auditors and those from the
                    Malawi Government inspected the projects and compared receipts with
                    quantities/qualities of materials. There were no significant discrepancies. Our
                    auditors and engineers (from the AID Regional Office in Nairobi) frequently told
                    us how far superior the Malawi accounting systems were to those of the
                    surrounding countries. Fiscal honesty and accountability was a particular trait
                    of Banda. Torture and murder did not seem to offend his conscience, but
                    financial irregularities by civil servants, politicians, or businessmen
                    infuriated him. He considered such acts as “disloyalty”, and thus severely
                    punishable. The Auditor General and the Minister of Finance were Scotsmen, as
                    were several of the senior officers in both departments. The auditors had power
                    to go on short notice into any government office to look at the books. So there
                    was very little petty corruption.</p>
                <p>The financial malfeasance took place on a much higher level. The sole political
                    party in the country, the Malawi Congress Party, gained enormous economic power
                    and wealth by seeking a minority interest in every financial enterprise in the
                    country. Businesses would seek to keep the amount as low as possible. There
                    were, of course, no legislation or regulations on the subject, so how many
                    shares should be “donated” was “negotiated”. Failure to comply meant closing the
                    business, since permits, licenses, contracts, sales to government, etc. would be
                    canceled. Some businessmen refused to comply and left the country; others were
                    forced out. The hardest hit were the Asians. They would reach an agreement about
                    the percentage of shares to be “donated” to the MCP, only to discover that they
                    had to increase the number the next year. Dividends or profits would accrue to
                    the Party. The money was used to pay Party expenses, including the Young
                    Pioneers, and for whatever purposes Banda decided. The process was a national
                    rip-off and extortion scheme. The Government's money was sacrosanct; there was
                    no direct stealing of Government funds. The country as a whole, however,
                    suffered thereby. Businesses tended to raise their prices to compensate for
                    their losses from having to give away a percentage of their company. In addition
                    to the funds from business ownership, the Party collected membership dues from
                    every Malawian. Everyone had to become a card-carrying member and keep the dues
                    up to date. People would be asked by Young Pioneers to show their Party card on
                    the street, in a bus, at a restaurant, etc. Failure to produce a card could
                    result in a trip to a local Party office, a jail, or a fine.</p>

                <p>BUCHE: The way this came about is that the Peace Corps was forced out of Malawi
                    by Banda because he was concerned about the dangerous ideas that were being
                    passed from the Peace Corps teachers to their students - such things as
                    democracy, free press, political parties, discussions of that sort. So he just
                    decided to get rid of the Peace Corps teachers. That was about 90% of the PCV's
                    in Malawi. The Peace Corps Director left in protest, as well as for the fact
                    that there would not be much for him to do after the expulsions. There were
                    about a dozen Peace Corps Volunteers who were not instantly expelled. These were
                    Volunteers who were in non-teaching positions. They had technical jobs in the
                    ministries. They were permitted by Banda to finish their terms before departing.
                    Half of them decided to leave in solidarity with their PCV teaching colleagues.
                    The remaining five or six stayed for personal reasons - usually because of
                    Malawian fianc�es. One of the PCVs who was expelled was Paul Theroux. He took
                    his revenge on Banda, the Young Pioneers, and the Party by satirizing them in
                    some short stories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Paul Theroux is quite a well-known travel author,
                        mainly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Yes, he was teaching English in one of the high schools in Malawi, and
                    after being expelled, wrote some short stories about Malawi with Banda and
                    company as the butt of some pretty vicious humor. The reason I was the AID
                    Director is that there was an effort to consolidate the AID programs in southern
                    and eastern Africa into a regional approach. AID technicians, accountants,
                    lawyers, engineers, and others were centralized in a Regional Office at Mbabane,
                    Swaziland or Nairobi, Kenya to support the AID projects throughout the region.
                    DCM's at five embassies in southern Africa replaced the AID directors and
                    managed the projects locally. Whenever the embassies needed help or advice, they
                    telephoned or cabled Nairobi or Mbabane. If the issue could be worked out over
                    the phone, fine; if not, an AID official or team would arrange to come to the
                    country.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>After a few months it was clear that my responsibilities as the AID director were
                    taking much more time than my responsibilities as DCM. This was not a problem,
                    however, because there was not much happening politically in the country, and we
                    had a really first-rate staff. Some of the very best officers with whom I would
                    ever work in the Foreign Service were with me in Blantyre. Some of them went on
                    to much higher positions. One of them was Jerry Bremer, who was our political
                    officer. He went to Kissinger's personal staff, was named as Ambassador to the
                    Netherlands, and later became an Assistant Secretary for Anti-Terrorist
                    Activities. Another was Bert Moore, who was the administrative officer and went
                    high in his field. Our US Information Officer was Jim Thurber. He reached the
                    upper ranks of the USIA bureaucracy in his area. Oulocally-hired employees, the
                    Foreign Service Nationals (FSNs), were dedicated, talented Malawians. Unlike in
                    Ethiopia, where Anike and I seldom socialized off-hours with the FSNs, we found
                    several of the Malawian employees quite interesting and compatible. Our consular
                    assistant, Mrs. Rosemary Argente, knew almost all the major players in politics,
                    business, and academia. She also understood the nuances of Malawi politics. She
                    was so valuable to the Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Was Bill Burdett. He was a Middle Eastern specialist, including North
                    Africa and Turkey. Blantyre was his last assignment. After decades of turmoil
                    and chaos in various countries where he was DCM, Charg�, or Political Counselor,
                    he wanted a quiet final assignment - and he got it. Ambassador Burdett carried
                    out his duties responsibly and with a skill that comes from many years of
                    experience. The entire staff really liked and admired him and his wife, Marlys
                    (a former Foreign Service secretary).</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at the map, Malawi thrusts right inside
                        Mozambique. Whawas happening in Mozambique?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Well, there was an insurgency against the Portuguese coloniaregime that
                    had ruled the country for centuries.</p>
                <p>Q: That's what I was going to say. I would have thought that you would be up to
                    your neck in reporting on the insurgency and what was going on there.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>BUCHE: We were doing some reporting in normal channels on information that we
                    would get from the Malawi Government, the British High Commission, and the South
                    Africans. We were under restraints from the Department not to be aggressive in
                    pursuing leads or information on the insurgency outside of diplomatic contacts.
                    The bulk of the reporting on the struggle between Portugal and Frelimo was done
                    by the Agency. The CIA had a big operation in Malawi. The Chief of Station was
                    Jim Warrick. He was relatively young to head such a large operation, but he was
                    bright, alert, politically savvy, and had great self confidence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any problem with Banda and company to have this
                        CIoperation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Parts of it were declared. The CIA station chief was declared to the
                    Malawi Government, and there were certain programs where they worked together
                    with the Malawi Intelligence Service. It was to our mutual interests to know
                    what was going on with the insurgency and with the Portuguese counterinsurgency
                    measures. As you can imagine, with Malawi stuck, in a sense, as a finger into
                    Mozambique, there was a lot of sloshing over of operations and some firefights
                    that got into Malawi territory. Both sides, the Portuguese and Frelimo, would
                    apologize to the Malawi Government and give assurances it would not happen
                    again. Malawi was scarcely able to defend itself against large-scale incursions
                    by either Portuguese or Frelimo units. Malawi, of course, recognized this, and
                    tried to persuade both sides to stay out of Malawi. Both sides recognized if one
                    side really antagonized Malawi to a large extent, Banda' Government might move
                    from its neutral position toward helping the other. So there was a mutual
                    incentive for both sides to avoid antagonizing Malawi. On the other hand, Malawi
                    depended economically on Portugal/Mozambique for use of the ports and on Frelimo
                    to allow transit through the areas they controlled. Banda felt more at ease with
                    the Portuguese than with Frelimo, because the latter was a Marxist-based
                    insurgency and an unknown quantity as far as he was concerned. He also realized
                    that the Portuguese probably were not going to be able to hold on in the long
                    run, and he did not want to be on the losing side. Philosophically, he may have
                    been rooting for the Portuguese, but he was realistic. Also, the strength of
                    Frelimo was basically in the central and northern parts of Mozambique, and this
                    is where Malawi had its main transport links to the coastal ports.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Tanzania? Malawi abuts on Tanzania. What was
                        youimpression of developments there? We are talking about 1971-72?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: It was the time under Nyerere. A lot of international development aid was
                    going into Tanzania. At that time Nyerere was the “darling” of the Nordics, the
                    World Bank, the Christian churches, and even the U.S.G. This really upset Banda.
                    He repeatedly proclaimed that most of the money given to Tanzania would be
                    wasted. It's pouring water into the sand.”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It does seem to me he was absolutely right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Well, very often what he said about Tanzania was factually correct. He
                    weakened his arguments, however, by personal attacks on Nyerere. Banda despised
                    him. He was angry that the West liked Nyerere, and he could not see why the West
                    was reluctant to put more money into his Malawi. Banda saw the development
                    assistance issue from his own optic. He was a staunch friend of the West and
                    made sure that foreign assistance funds granted to Malawi would not be wasted.
                    Besides, be refused to recognize Beijing or allow the Soviets or any Warsaw Pact
                    country to open an embassy in Malawi. Yet, the West (with the exception of the
                    UK) was hesitant to fund bilateral assistance projects in the country. They much
                    preferred to put money into “socialist” Tanzania.</p>
                <p>On several occasions, Banda summoned Ambassador Burdett and me to State House to
                    berate the U.S.G. for helping Tanzania build a road, a bridge, or some other
                    project. His theme was the same each time: If the U.S. Government would put more
                    money into Malawi, you know the money would not be frittered away or disappear;
                    it will be well spent, and the project will be well maintained. Twenty years
                    later you will still have something to show with pride. If the U.S. Government
                    and the World Bank give money to Tanzania, they will have nothing to show for it
                    in ten years. It will be wasted or stolen. We knew what Banda was saying was
                    correct, but we also had to defend our Government's policies, as well as explain
                    to him why Malawi was low on the priority list for U.S. assistance, despite its
                    excellent use and accountability of the funds. We said that there is not more
                    money coming to Malawi - and we had to choose the best diplomatic language -
                    because many in our Congress are opposed to South Africa and its system of
                    apartheid. Since Malawi had diplomatic relations with South Africa, there was
                    the belief in Congress that Malawi was wrong in not maintaining the Africa-wide
                    ban on formal relations with South Africa. When the policy makers in Washington
                    divided the African-assistance pie, they were conscious of the negative
                    reputation of Malawi in Congress, the American churches, and the press. We
                    assured Banda that we kept Washington aware of the good use by Malawi of
                    American assistance. He was not satisfied with our explanations, but there was
                    not much he could do. He certainly was not going to change his policy toward
                    South Africa. Not only did Malawi receive millions of dollars from Pretoria each
                    year in assistance, but Banda believed that he had a morally correct policy
                    toward South Africa.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>He did not approve of apartheid, but criticized the policy. He maintained that
                    race relations would improve in South Africa if there were a dialogue between
                    the people in the country and between African states and South Africa. He
                    frequently proclaimed that many African states secretly traded with South
                    Africa, but only Malawi openly published trade data on the transactions. What
                    Banda could not comprehend was that his policies of repression through the Young
                    Pioneers, his edicts against long hair, short skirts, slacks, or God forbid!
                    shorts on women, and rock and roll, his extortion of merchants, particularly the
                    Indians and Pakistanis, plus his cultivation of the South Africans made him a
                    pariah in the eyes of Western governments. Of course, putting money into
                    Tanzania turned out to be the folly Banda had predicted. As we all learned by
                    the end of the Cold War, most African assistance projects turned sour.
                    Assistance to Africa was usually politically motivated, not the result of cold,
                    economic analyses. We were going for headlines and PR points rather than solid
                    projects. We were not alone. The Russians, the Chinese and so many other donors
                    were pouring money into Africa. As I would learn personally years later from the
                    Chinese Ambassador to Zambia (his previous assignment was Ambassador to
                    Tanzania), Beijing continued to lavish money on Tanzania despite a stream of
                    warnings from the Chinese Embassy in Dar Es Salaam that the Chinese-financed
                    projects were heading toward failures because of local corruption, malfeasance,
                    and incompetence</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, particularly the Nordic countries.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: They adopted Tanzania and other East African countries.</p>
                <p>Q: Nyerere was a charmer. He was probably the worst administrator and in many
                    ways, a tyrant on his own, I mean in the nicest possible fashion, but he forced
                    people onto these disastrous collective farms.</p>
                <p>BUCHE: Well, in Zambia - we were putting money into Zambia, too. Kaunda was very
                    close to Nyerere, but Kaunda, at least, did not get into collective farms. He
                    did enough other dumb things from an economic and political point of view that
                    the result was that we and other donors poured money into the proverbial rat
                    hole - nothing really took. I think both in Tanzania and in Zamba the corruption
                    was quite enormous. It was just blatant and ubiquitous, whereas in Malawi it was
                    different. There was corruption at the very top in Malawi, but you didn't get
                    pecked to death by sparrows. Foreign aid was well accounted for. The private
                    sector, however, had to pay Banda and his Malawi Congress Party.</p>

                <p>BUCHE: Eventually, when the Indians and Pakistanis were forced to give up their
                    stores, Africans in good stead with the MCP took over. The net losers were the
                    customers because the new owners were not really businesspeople. Some of them
                    went out of business, and others just raised prices. The losers were the people
                    out in the countryside.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, this generally is what happens, that often those that take over the
                    stores do not stock them. They basically sell off the stock and then sit there
                    and wait for something to happen, no investment.</p>
                <p>BUCHE: The people who took over were basically the local politicians, police
                    chiefs, or civil servants with good Party connections.. They were not interested
                    in the running of stores and making a little bit of profit every day. They
                    wanted quick profits. The Malawi Congress Party had a supermarket chain - I
                    forget the name of it - but they did fairly well in the big cities, since there
                    were no competitors allowed. As the small “Indian shops” in the countryside went
                    out of business from greed and mismanagement, the MCP decided to extend its
                    supermarket chain. Most were eventually closed because there were not enough
                    sales to support the large stores. The people in the countryside were again
                    without access to such basic things as salt, sugar, batteries, soap, medicines,
                    canned goods, cooking oil, etc. They had to depend on wandering traders who
                    would sell them something from the rear of a pickup truck, which meant the price
                    was much higher.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything else we should touch on before we move
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Well, I think we pretty much have covered Malawi. I want to mention that
                    Banda asked the Peace Corps to return, but at a much more senior level. He did
                    not want secondary-school teachers, but surgeons, dermatologists, teaching
                    nurses, air-traffic controllers, heavy-duty equipment mechanics, et al.
                    Washington was anxious to try new directions for older Peace Corps Volunteers,
                    and gave priority to filling Banda's shopping list. Within a year following the
                    banishment of the PCV schoolteachers, the new group began arriving. They filled
                    regular Malawi Government positions, so they were entitled to the perks of their
                    rank. All received government housing; some even had cars and drivers assigned
                    to them. The new group was obligated to spend only one year in the Peace Corps,
                    so there was a heavy turnover. Malawi gained some highly competent professionals
                    at bargain rates; the Americans gained the experience of living in a third-world
                    country and contributing to its development. Several mentioned to me that they
                    gained professionally because they were forced to work with a significantly
                    lower level of technology and had to use their intuition, intelligence, and wit
                    to compensate.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>I also wanted to mention that the AID-financed road was completed and dedicated.
                    I had to resolve many problems along the way, including working out a tax and
                    fee dispute with the Beira Port Authority so that our heavy equipment could be
                    released, obtaining speedy replacements for contractor personnel who quit or
                    were expelled from the country (usually for racist remarks), and gaining
                    agreement on changes in specifications or acceptances of work performed. As
                    pleased as I was to be heavily involved in the successful completion of the road
                    construction project, I was even more thrilled to return to Malawi on a visit
                    ten years later and see that our road was still in good condition.</p>
                <p>As I was leaving Malawi, the diplomatic community was of the opinion that Banda
                    was in his last years of power. Once again foreigners underestimated the ability
                    and determination of African dictators to maintain power. Banda held on for over
                    a decade before being driven from office.</p>
                <p>I despised Banda and his oppressive regime. I personally knew several Malawians
                    who were arrested, tortured, and killed during my posting to that country. They
                    were, in some cases my neighbors, in other cases, Ministry of External Affairs
                    officials with whom I dealt. I regarded them as honest, dedicated, competent
                    civil servants. They met their deaths because they were accused of disloyalty to
                    President-for-Life H. Kamuzu Banda. In each case, the men were taken from their
                    home at night and were not seen again by their family or friends. Inquiries
                    about their location or the charges against them were fruitless. There was no
                    information on where they were held, no public trials, no lawyers to defend
                    them, and no verdict publicized. Several weeks or months after their arrest,
                    their wives were told they had “died in prison” or had been “killed while trying
                    to escape”. The wives were also told where they had been buried. Since they were
                    government officials, they lived in government-supplied housing. After their
                    deaths, the families were evicted from the housing. In a few of the cases, the
                    wives also worked for the government; they were fired. Who their accusers were
                    and for what motives, I do not know. We all heard many stories that the easiest
                    way to avenge someone in Malawi, to get a promotion or a better house, or to
                    acquire a man's coveted wife was to concoct some examples of his “criticism” of
                    Banda or the Party and denounce him in secret to the Security People for
                    “disloyalty”. Not all such victims were executed, but by the time they got out
                    of prison, they had suffered greatly.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>Paradoxically, the greatest number of accusers and victims were Party officials,
                    including some from the highest ranks. There was a feeling among the foreigners
                    (and probably also among many Malawians) of Schadenfreude, when the official in
                    charge of the Young Pioneers, Albert Muwalo, probably the most-feared man in the
                    country, was accused of “disloyalty”. He was arrested, tortured, and killed,
                    like so many of his victims! Many of us concluded that Banda and his niece, Miss
                    Kazimira, had arranged the execution to eliminate a powerful, potential rival.
                    We had the impression that Banda deliberately fomented suspicion and distrust
                    among the top people in the Party against each other to ensure their total
                    dependence on him. He created insecurity and hyper-vigilance, and only he could
                    “protect” them against the inevitable charges of “disloyalty” from their
                    colleagues (and rivals). The stakes were very, very high, and led to desperate
                    and despicable methods for self-protection. It was a combination of Stalinism,
                    the NKVD, the Stasi, the Taliban, and the Red Guards in lovely, scenic
                    Malawi.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, I would have thought that because of this system, it would mean that all
                    of you at the Embassy would deal very carefully so that you did not hurt the
                    people you were dealing with by pushing for something which might get the people
                    you were having to work with in the ministries into trouble.</p>
                <p>BUCHE: We were quite concerned about that. We recognized that to have a meeting
                    or a discussion with a minister or an official could put him or her into
                    jeopardy, so there would be other people present. The conversation would be very
                    formal. I cannot recall any real substantive, free-wheeling, private talk with a
                    minister or high official. I do not think that Ambassador Burdett ever mentioned
                    to me that he had such a conversation. It was always so formal. When there was a
                    reception, we would not dare out of concern for our Malawian interlocutors to
                    talk or ask questions about anything other than the weather, boating, the
                    fishing on Lake Malawi, soccer matches, game parks, or what was happening in the
                    United States. They seemed to be interested in learning what was happening in
                    the United States, and we would tell them, because that was a safe subject. The
                    agents and informers for the Malawian intelligence services were ubiquitous and
                    aggressive. Malawians lived in fear about what might happen to them. They just
                    could not take the risk of being close to foreigners.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Soviets making any inroads?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>BUCHE: The Soviets did not have a chance in Malawi. They were active in Zambia
                    and Tanzania, but they were not in Malawi. Ditto for Beijing. The Chinese from
                    the mainland were represented in the other two countries with large embassies
                    and several large economic development projects, including the Tanzam railroad.
                    Taiwan sent a large embassy staff and several hundred technical advisers to
                    Malawi. Banda made no effort to hide his determination to keep “socialism and
                    communism” out of Malawi. I do not think the Soviets or Chinese made much of an
                    effort to initiate diplomatic relations with Banda. They knew it would be
                    fruitless. I am sure the Chinese kept tabs on what the Taiwanese were doing in
                    Malawi, since they were so massively represented in two neighboring
                    countries.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: I have to think. Yes, I did leave in 1972.</p>

                <p>BUCHE: I came back to the Foreign Service Institute to study French,since I was
                    assigned to Niamey, Niger, as DCM.</p>
                <p>

                <p>BUCHE: No, I took it for four months.</p>

                <p>BUCHE: From January 1973 to July 1975.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now who was ambassador there when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: My first ambassador was Ross or Roswell McClelland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was Roswell...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>BUCHE: Yes, but we called him “Ross”. He was there for about six months. I was
                    told that there would be a hiatus between McClellan and the new ambassador,
                    whoever that was to be, and I would be in charge for several months. Ambassador
                    McClellan had spent three years there, and this was his last assignment before
                    retiring. His wife was not well. He was trying to keep things on an even keel.
                    He recognized that Niger was not a country of any strategic interest to us. It
                    was, however, important to the French. We had a Peace Corps program of about
                    forty volunteers and a small AID program. We would periodically offer to send a
                    Nigerien army officer to the US for six months training. Our policy was based on
                    the reality that Niger was a former French colony and the French pretty much
                    controlled things. They had advisors in all the ministries, and French
                    commercial interests had a lock on the economy. French military and police
                    advisers were found in every major unit. The French-equivalent of the Peace
                    Corps had Cooperants throughout the country. The French Embassy was the center
                    of control, and the French Ambassador was the focal point.</p>
                <p>Niger still had its first generation leadership. President Hamani Diori had been
                    in power since independence. There had been some attempts to overthrow him, but
                    he (with French assistance) had put them all down. Niger was a terribly poor
                    country, absolutely impoverished. When I arrived, the drought was raging. There
                    was starvation among the nomads in the northern reaches of Niger, and food
                    shortages throughout the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the Sahel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: The Sahel, yes. Under the best of circumstances, the nomads in the north
                    of the country were poor, but during a drought period they lost their animals
                    and some lost their lives. Many of them were eventually able to get down to
                    wherever camps were set up by the Red Cross and others humanitarian groups. Some
                    of them waited too long before moving south, and it was just too late.</p>
                <p>Regarding the politics and economics of Niger, we were interested in following
                    what was happening, but we did not have important interests at stake. There were
                    some medium-grade deposits of uranium in the north, and a French company was
                    exploiting them. This was not France's only source of uranium - it was a source
                    - and they were interested in that. There was some drilling for oil or gas, but
                    that was not successful. There were some minor finds of other minerals, but not
                    of a commercial nature. The French felt that they had to keep the country going
                    since it had been part of their empire at one time. They were more interested in
                    what was happening further south, because the C�te d'Ivoire was really much more
                    important economically and politically to Paris.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>Nigeria was interested in Niger for security and economic reasons. They did not
                    want the people of Niger to come into Nigeria looking for jobs. Also they did
                    not want any of Niger's periodic tribal squabbles to move southward or their own
                    Hausa or Fulani people to move northward into Niger. Nigeria was not willing to
                    put much money into helping Niger, but tried to be a good neighbor during the
                    drought by facilitating the transit of emergency food. Nigeria was experiencing
                    an economic boom because of oil profits, and so the Lagos harbor was jammed with
                    ships offloading goods for local consumption. As a result of heavy international
                    pressure, the Nigerian Government gave some priority to emergency food shipments
                    for Niger. The Canadian Government was interested in Niger and other
                    French-speaking Sahelian countries because of the language issue. The Province
                    of Quebec had an assistance program whose main goal was to build a road across
                    the Sahel to link Chad, Niger, Mali, Haute Volta, (now Burkina Faso),
                    Mauritania, and Senegal. The road was called “the Unity Road.” No one was
                    interested in stirring up things. It was a quiet time politically for my first
                    year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Libya?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Libya tried, but it was so far away. Libya bordered Niger on the
                    northeast, but there was a lot of desert between Libya and any population
                    centers in Niger. Libya at the time seemed more interested in stirring up
                    problems with its other neighboring states. We heard stories about Libya sending
                    rifles to the Tuaregs in northern Niger and trying to stir up a rebellion
                    against Diori. We had no way of checking out the stories, so we asked the French
                    Ambassador. He said that Libya was trying to foment trouble in Niger's north,
                    but the situation was under control. He also told us that the situation in Chad
                    was more precarious, but was containable. The French Ambassador confirmed that
                    the French Foreign Legion (based in Chad) had seen action in that country
                    against Libyan-supported rebels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the French have to bring in the Foreign Legion from
                        time ttime into Niger?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: No, not during my time there. I do not recall that the Foreign Legion was
                    ever used in Niger since independence in 1960. The French had a couple of
                    hundred of their own troops in Niger to help train. I imagine these troops could
                    be used to protect the Embassy and French citizens, if necessary. The
                    interesting thing is that when the coup took place in April 1994, the French
                    remained neutral. They did not take action to protect Diori. Since the Nigerien
                    military maintained public order, there was no need for the French soldiers to
                    become active.</p>

                <p>BUCHE: Yes, I was the charg�. Ross McClellan left as planned in July of 1973, and
                    I took over expecting to be in charge for the customary month or two. I remained
                    in charge until June 1994, since the ambassador for whom we had obtained an
                    agr�ment was retained by Kissinger for his own staff.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: He was eventually made Ambassador to Athens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Stearns?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Yes, it was Monteagle Stearns. He was to come to Niger, and I looked
                    forward very much to working with him. He had a wonderful reputation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did the coup take place, and why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: There were many reasons for the coup. The drought had become worse and
                    worse. More people were dying. Many of the embassies, the UN organizations, and
                    private groups were trying to get permission to do things on their own, to
                    deliver food, medicines, fodder, shelter, and other necessities. The Nigerien
                    Government was reluctant to allow USAID, Caritas, the Quebec Group, Lutheran
                    World Relief, or other organizations to go very far outside of the major cities
                    to distribute food directly to the people in need or to set up emergency
                    shelters or clinics. The Government wanted everything done through the Nigerien
                    Red Cross or the Political Party. In a few cases, external donors could work
                    through the Nigerien Army. In theory, this was understandable and acceptable,
                    but in reality the Red Cross and the Party did not have the logistical
                    capability to do this. Also these entities were stealing substantial amounts.
                    There was a standoff between the international community and the Niger
                    Government. We were able to do certain things, such as airdrops, but were not
                    allowed to take our USAID-donated trucks with our PL-480 food out into the
                    countryside and assist the starving nomads. The US military decided not to send
                    planes to Niger for airdrops, so we worked with the Belgian Air Force. The
                    French Air Force did not need or want any help. The Belgians made about twenty
                    airdrops over a three-week period. I went on a few of these. When we saw bands
                    of nomads, we would swoop down and kick out a big bladder of water, a pallet of
                    high-energy biscuits, dried fruits, and powdered milk, plus some hay for the
                    animals, if there were any still surviving. Airdrops of food, fodder, and water
                    are an inefficient way to deliver such necessities, especially when there are
                    possibilities of using small aircraft as spotters and directing trucks to the
                    targets. Because of the Nigerien Government restrictions on surface deliveries,
                    airdrops were the only alternative to reaching the nomads in the north.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>The Nigerien Army wanted to do more, but was largely kept out of the food
                    distribution. Diori was playing politics with the drought. He wanted to use the
                    two organizations he trusted and controlled, the Red Cross (Madame Diori was
                    President) and his political party in order to gain credit for relieving the
                    suffering and deprivation. He did not trust the military beyond the generals. He
                    certainly did not want the colonels and majors to gain any publicity or goodwill
                    from the people for bringing food. Observers could see that food was not
                    reaching the people most in need, the nomads and the small rural hamlets. The
                    diplomatic community and the international humanitarian groups met frequently
                    under the aegis of the UN Development Program Representative, Sandy Rotival, (a
                    dynamic American married to an equally dynamic French wife, Edith) to discuss
                    what we could do. Our interventions with Diori and his Ministers had little
                    effect. They promised us that they were aware of the problems and would improve
                    the distribution channels if we would give them even more trucks, more food,
                    more money, and more technical assistance. It was clear that Diori was more
                    interested in control than in meeting the needs of the suffering and dying
                    people. We were prevented from taking steps that would have saved lives. That is
                    one reason we used airdrops, despite their high cost. At least some people were
                    saved.</p>
                <p>The Nigerien Army finally took action. On Easter Monday morning in April 1974, a
                    battalion of soldiers stormed the Palace and arrested Diori. Madame Diori was
                    killed resisting arrest. All the cabinet ministers and the top politicians were
                    put under house arrest, as were the generals. About a dozen soldiers lost their
                    lives, so it was not a particularly bloody coup. The people of Niger were
                    delighted to see Diori ousted. He was losing support even before the drought,
                    but his handling of that catastrophe vitiated whatever good will remained. His
                    wife's greed and venality were well known. She was widely detested, and the
                    strong feelings against Madame Diori also hurt the President.</p>
                <p>I had seen the French Ambassador on Good Friday and said there were rumors that
                    something serious was going on. I told him I happened to notice that there was
                    three machine gun emplacements at the Palace that I had not noticed a week
                    earlier. He was enigmatic. He replied, “I think things are under control. I am
                    not going to be here for the holidays.” He told me he was going camping with his
                    family for the holidays.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>Around four in the morning, I heard what I first thought were fireworks, and my
                    first reaction was this is an odd time to have fireworks. I wondered whether it
                    was a custom in Niger to have fireworks on Easter Monday morning. Then I
                    realized those noises were machine guns and mortars. I flung open the shutters,
                    and a tank went past the house. I assumed this was a coup attempt. I tried to
                    phone, but the line was dead. There was no backup radio in my residence. Only
                    the residences of the Ambassador and the AID Mission Director had radios. The
                    tank was now parked in front of our gate. I asked the crew to please move, since
                    I wanted to go to the Embassy. There were several roadblocks, but I got through
                    to the Embassy. There was no one there, and the telephones were all dead. I
                    needed the communications officer, so that I could send a cable to Washington
                    alerting them to the coup. I did not have access to the communications vault
                    where the cipher machines and the radios were kept. I decided to drive to his
                    house, about two miles away. Just as I was leaving the Embassy compound, I saw
                    him approaching. What a professional Joseph Acquavilla was! He knew he was
                    needed at the Embassy, and managed to get through. I listened to the local radio
                    to learn what had happened. The coup was successful, and there were communiques
                    and martial music. I drafted a short cable summarizing what we knew. Joe then
                    informed me that our landline with the local PTT was blocked. We could not send
                    a cable. Our communications equipment at Embassy Niamey was not so sophisticated
                    in those days. We did all our own encoding and decoding, but we had to use a
                    landline from the Embassy to the Nigerien Post, Telephone, and Telegraph Office
                    to transmit our telegrams.</p>
                <p>Since we could not send a cable, we used our radio to call up the Consulate at
                    Kaduna, Nigeria. I explained to the Consul that a coup had taken place in Niger;
                    we had no way of communicating with Washington; and would he send a cable to the
                    Department. I read him my draft. We had to use Kaduna for the rest of the day to
                    transmit bits of information, as we began to piece together what had happened.
                    Since we were without telephones, we had to go around in our cars (through the
                    checkpoints) to try to make contact with people who might know more than what
                    was being broadcast on the local radio. I found the Taiwanese Ambassador to be
                    well informed. Ironically, he knew his Embassy's days were numbered because the
                    Government of Taiwan had such close links with deposed President Diori. It was
                    widely assumed that Taiwan was putting money into Diori's personal off-shore
                    banking account. The French Ambassador was not to be reached, but I finally
                    tracked down his DCM. He told me he also wanted to go camping over the holidays,
                    but the Ambassador insisted he stay in town. The DCM admitted the Embassy was
                    not surprised by the recent event. I then realized why the French Ambassador
                    wanted to be on a camping trip in the desert, and thus theoretically unreachable
                    by telephone from the Palace. He made sure to be out of town, so that Diori
                    could not call upon him to have the French military rescue him. That was my
                    reading. When I next saw the Ambassador, he smiled when I said, “Now I know why
                    you were out of town for the holidays.”</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>There were a few casualties on both sides, not many. The most important casualty
                    was Madame Diori, who was considered the “dragon lady.” She was universally
                    detested by almost anyone who came in contact with her, whether it was the
                    diplomatic corps, the NGOs, the UN, or her own people. She was rapacious and
                    greedy. She was also audacious. She would notice a ring, a brooch, or a necklace
                    on a woman at a party or reception, and ask to “borrow” it for a while.
                    Nigeriens were dreadfully afraid of her, and so they would acquiesce. Of course,
                    they learned never to wear anything of value after that to events where she
                    might be present. Even some wives of diplomats and UN officials were asked. Some
                    did not really know what to do; they were so astounded that the wife of the
                    President would ask them for a piece of jewelry they were wearing. They would
                    give it to her, expecting she would give it back. In some cases she did, if the
                    husband made an issue of it with the Foreign Minister or the President.</p>
                <p>The soldiers who fought their way into the Palace arrested the President, and
                    then they went after her. They shot her many times. The soldiers claimed that
                    she fired at them first. She may have.</p>
                <p>Order was restored in Niamey. The tanks left the streets, and the checkpoints
                    were removed. The Government announced that relations would go on as before,
                    except for the Chinese. Taiwan was out, and the Beijing Government was to come
                    in. The new Government was wary of Libya and kept a distance from Qadhafi.
                    Although Qadhafi sent a delegation soon after the coup, the Libyans did not open
                    up an embassy. Most foreign governments began recognizing the new Nigerien
                    Government within days. At the time of the coup, the U.S. Government had been
                    debating what our recognition policy should be when a government is ousted by
                    non-democratic means. Should we withhold recognition even if the new government
                    is firmly in control, or should we be realistic and state that recognition is
                    not a seal of approval, but an acknowledgment of political realities. The
                    Kissinger doctrine of Realpolitik prevailed. I received a cable to convey our
                    recognition after about a week.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who took over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: A Lt. Colonel named Kountche. He was in the second tier of the military
                    hierarchy. He and a small group of majors, captains, and lieutenants planned the
                    coup and carried it off successfully. One unit seized the national radio
                    station; one took over the PTT; another unit went to the police headquarters;
                    other units went to the Army Headquarters and various military installations in
                    Niamey to neutralize their rescue attempts. The message of the Putschistes to
                    potentially loyalist units was: “You don't have to join us, but don't fight us,
                    and we'll take good care of you.” Several generals who were close to Diori
                    decided it was not to their interest to risk their lives defending their friend
                    and chief, so they just surrendered and were put under house arrest and
                    eventually were discharged and given a pension.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>About three weeks after the coup, Douglas Heck came to Niamey as the new American
                    Ambassador. He was accompanied by his wife, Ernie. He had been DCM in Teheran.
                    Ernie was a career Foreign Service Officer. Doug and Ernie were in Paris for
                    Easter and were scheduled to arrive in Niamey, the Tuesday after Easter. Because
                    of the coup, they were asked by the Department to return to Washington.</p>
                <p>The coup did not change significantly the daily life of many people in Niamey,
                    but for the people in the countryside, it turned out to be the event that saved
                    many of their lives. Kountche called the embassies, UN, and relief groups
                    together on the second or third day of the new regime to announce they were free
                    to distribute food and other necessities anywhere in the country. They had only
                    to inform the Army where they were going so there could be some coordination. He
                    offered to put the Army at the disposal of the relief groups if they needed
                    extra hands. Kountche said the reason that he had overthrown Diori was that the
                    former President no longer cared for the welfare of the country, was hindering
                    the relief efforts, and had allowed relief food to be stolen by his wife and his
                    Party supporters. The Army had seized warehouses that were the private property
                    of Madame Diori, and opened them for the public to see. They contained trucks,
                    medicines, and bags of wheat and rice with the logos from the UN, from the
                    Common Market, and Japan. Madame Diori was said to have already sold tons of
                    grain for her private gain, and from what was in the warehouses, she was
                    planning to sell more. People could wander through, and journalists were
                    encouraged to film and to write about what they were seeing. Madame Diori was
                    not in the same league with Imelda Marcos. She did not have 800 pairs of shoes,
                    but she had several hundred boubous, the traditional dress, and much jewelry. In
                    another clever gesture by the new Government, people were invited to reclaim
                    jewelry taken from them. I do not know how many people actually got their pieces
                    back, but I assume some were reclaimed, particularly if they had some sort of
                    proof.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Something engraved on it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Yes, a name, initials, a proof of purchase from a store, or some evidence
                    of a previous attempt to get the jewelry back. It was a great PR gesture. The
                    Kountche Government did not have to worry about a backlash of sympathy for Diori
                    and the old guard. They were thoroughly discredited. Diori was eventually
                    released from house arrest in Zinder and allowed to go to the C�te d'Ivoire,
                    where he was given asylum by Houphouet Boigny. Within several years of the coup,
                    the new crowd was emulating the ways of their predecessors. Bribes and theft of
                    public property, politically-motivated arrests, judicial decisions, promotions,
                    firings, contract awards, etc. were the norm, just as they had been under
                    Diori.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>Within months of the coup, the relief operations were running so well that the
                    donor countries and the UN began planning for the long-term. What could they do
                    to mitigate the damage and suffering from the next drought in the Sahel. The
                    enormous costs to the donors of the relief operations were key factors. A
                    decision was made, pushed by the UN as well as by the French, to do something
                    structurally for the Sahel that would enable the countries of the Sahel to
                    withstand future droughts. When people began adding up how much money it cost to
                    buy grain in the donor countries and transport it through the ports of West
                    Africa northward or from Algeria southward to the intended recipients, they were
                    willing to invest money in potential long-term solutions. The USG spent several
                    hundred million dollars for the Sahel drought-relief efforts. Our relief
                    programs for Niger were varied. AID purchased twelve, large ten-wheeler Berliet
                    trucks in Algeria, filled them with grain and drove them southward across the
                    desert to make distributions from that direction. We also rented trucks to bring
                    the grain from Lagos and Abidjan ports. It was enormously costly. Government
                    officials, scientists, and economists began meeting in conferences to discuss
                    solutions for the long term. Some of the principal ideas were to develop
                    drought-resistant sorghum (the staple crop in the Sahel), deeper wells,
                    campaigns aimed at encouraging better use of the limited grazing areas, better
                    weather forecasting, expanded agricultural surveillance, better communications
                    and more clinics in the countryside. It was decided to set up a voluntary Sahel
                    Fund to cover the costs of the programs.</p>
                <p>Washington was interested in doing something, so there was money available.
                    Television had had its impact on America and Western Europe. CNN and others
                    networks had shown wrenching images of starving babies, mothers trying to nurse
                    their babies, but having no milk, skeletons and cadavers by the roadside. There
                    were frequent visits by TV crews from all over the world to the Sahel. NBC, CBS,
                    and CNN came from the US to Niger. The TV news accounts often made the Diori
                    Government angry. The President complained to me that CNN came to Niger looking
                    for starving babies, and did not want to film the camps on the edges of the
                    major cities where some of the nomads were being assisted. We suggested to the
                    TV crews that they might want to take some footage of the camps. They would
                    shoot some scenes, but would not use that portion in the final product. They
                    preferred the dramatic scenes of suffering and death from the northern
                    reaches.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>There was a ground swell of sympathy in the United States. We got a cable from
                    the Department saying that Mrs. Nixon wanted to come out to the area and that
                    she would be bringing a contingent of nearly 200 to show the US sympathy for the
                    starving people of the Sahel. What was the Government's and the Embassy's
                    opinion on this? I went to the Palace and posed the question to President Diori.
                    He asked how many would be in the First Lady's party. When I told him about 200,
                    he was silent. Finally, he answered Qua faire? What can I do? The American
                    people have given us help, so we should thank the American people through her.
                    She is welcome. Diori added in an aside that her visit would practically shut
                    down the government for days and force numerous UN officials and relief workers
                    from hotels and government guest houses, but Mrs. Nixon was chaleureusement
                    bienvenue. I reported our conversation absolutely straight. I was the first to
                    respond to Washington. Most of the other ambassadors and charg�s reported
                    similar reactions from their host governments. Her visit will be a heavy burden,
                    but we are a hospitable and grateful nation and we will receive her with
                    dignity. Our Ambassador in Ouagadougou, Don Easom, took a different approach. He
                    sent a short reply saying he did not want to approach the government at this
                    stage since the President would probably respond along the lines of what Diori,
                    Keita (Mali's President), and Senghor (Senegal's President) had said. He offered
                    his own opinion that a visit with such a large retinue would cause great
                    hardship and severe logistical problems for the governments. If Mrs. Nixon wants
                    to come as a gesture of sympathy, she should do so with a much smaller group. We
                    heard nothing for a few days, and then Washington cabled that because of other
                    pressing commitments, Mrs. Nixon could not visit the Sahel.</p>
                <p>While I escaped the headaches of a visit by the First Lady, there were other
                    difficult problems I faced as Charge. One involved our Public Affairs Officer.
                    He was in a bar one night and struck up a conversation with a correspondent from
                    one of the French newspapers. Our PAO was asked what he thought about Diori and
                    the Nigerien Government's drought relief efforts. He had never met the
                    correspondent before. Nevertheless, our PAO, instead of ducking the question or
                    speaking in generalities, apparently lambasted the President and the regime.
                    What our PAO did not realize was that the correspondent was a personal friend of
                    Diori and may actually have been on Diori's payroll. Two days later, I was
                    called to the Palace and told by Diori that our PAO had spoken in a way that
                    defamed the Nigerien Government. I was requested to quietly send him back to
                    Washington within two weeks.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>I was completely caught off-guard. I knew nothing of the prior conversation, so I
                    told the President I would speak with the officer to hear his side of the story.
                    I spoke with him as soon as I got back to the Embassy. He said it was a very
                    general and nothing personal against Diori. I reported the situation to
                    Washington. My instructions were to go back to Diori and confront him with the
                    PAO's version. I returned to the Palace. I asked the President whether he was
                    positive that the PAO had really said what he was accused of. His reply was that
                    a third person had overheard the conversation. The implication was that it was
                    another Frenchman. Diori gave me an ultimatum. Either withdraw the PAO quietly,
                    or he would declare him persona non grata. I then went back to the Embassy and
                    confronted the PAO with the new information. The PAO backtracked considerably on
                    his version of the conversation. I again reported to Washington. The response
                    was to withdraw the PAO and spare him the humiliation of being PNGed. He
                    received a decent assignment in Washington, so his career was not ruined. Years
                    later, I learned that he had also been declared persona non grata from a country
                    in South East Asia for publicly criticizing the government!</p>
                <p>Another source of concern to me (and the Peace Corps Director) was the public
                    behavior of a few of the Peace Corps Volunteers. This encompassed a wide range
                    of individual actions which I found inappropriate and insensitive. Some
                    examples: romantic relationships in public (an absolute no-no in rural Muslim
                    Niger); allegations of sexual relations with students; mini-skirts; drinking
                    alcohol in public (tolerated in the cities, but scandalous in small towns); and
                    open criticism of the regime (certainly deserved, but not the prerogative of a
                    PCV). There were also examples of irresponsibility by the PCVs in the personal
                    health area: failure to take the anti-malarial tablets on a regular basis,
                    failure to use a condom against STDs; failure to use “the pill” on a regular
                    basis, and for one PCV, the failure to refill her anti-asthma prescription. As a
                    result, there were numerous cases of malaria and STDs, several unwanted
                    pregnancies, and the death of the asthmatic. In most instances, the PCVs had to
                    be evacuated back to the States. In the latter case, not only was her corpse
                    flown back, but the young woman's roommate was so distraught that she, too, had
                    to be evacuated and her PC service terminated. It was the surviving roommate who
                    told us that her friend had run out of her medicine, but made no effort to renew
                    the supply. Several weeks later, a sand storm hit their town; she had an attack
                    and died.</p>
                <p>The number of PCVs in Niger at one time was not more than 50, but they caused
                    more concern and anguish than the 450 Volunteers in Ethiopia during my tour
                    there. The Niger group included a higher than usual percentage of immature
                    Volunteers. They should have been selected out while in training or sent home
                    early in their tour in country. The stricken individuals suffered; the Peace
                    Corps had its outstanding record in Niger badly tarnished; and the recipients of
                    the Volunteers' work, the students and the patients at the maternal and child
                    health clinics, were deprived of their services.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>As I was leaving the country, the idea of the Sahelian Initiative was in the
                    forefront. There were many workshops and policy discussions on the proposals in
                    Africa, Europe, and the U.S. Governments were determined to launch an attempt to
                    mitigate the effects, costs, and suffering of future droughts. I was a
                    “short-timer” in Niger, so I did not become deeply involved in the
                    medium-to-long-term planning or programming. That was probably wise, since I was
                    quite skeptical of many of the premises of the Initiative. I had a feeling that
                    we could not accomplish much to overcome a century of ecological degradation,
                    unless we and the other Western governments were willing to be quite generous in
                    our funding and the Sahelian governments were willing to enforce onerous, but
                    necessary laws regarding grazing, herd sizes, well drilling and use, etc. The
                    Sahel was becoming drier, and the desert was moving southward. The Sahara was
                    encroaching ever further southward, and there were abundant evidence and
                    measurements to document the phenomenon. It was a question of how far south the
                    desert was going to go, and could man stop the encroachment. Desertification,
                    was the word that we were throwing about at the time. People were saying, if we
                    plant millions of trees, we can stop this. The trees were there originally, but
                    they were cut down. There were also abundant grasses and shrubs, but they were
                    overgrazed and eventually failed to regenerate. Many scientists were convinced
                    the Sahel was in a long-term dry cycle. I was not optimistic that man-made
                    policies would be very successful in overcoming what man had done even in the
                    last century to aggravate the delicate ecological balance. I had seen numerous
                    photos of Niger's landscape from the turn of the century into the 1950s. I was
                    amazed at how many trees there had been, but over the years, the nomads and
                    others had cut the trees down. I talked to some people who had lived in Niger
                    for decades: missionary priests, former administrators, retired military, and
                    others. They spoke of how there had been more rainfall, cooler temperatures, and
                    much, much more vegetation thirty or forty years earlier. The meteorological
                    records dating back a century showed that the weather patterns had changed,
                    although there were differences of opinion on how much the cause was man-made
                    and how much was cyclical. The old timers agreed that when the country became
                    independent, many of the colonial restrictions on cutting trees, drilling wells,
                    and limiting grazing were cast aside. The other Sahelian countries experienced
                    similar reactions. Some of my interlocutors argued that the accelerated
                    ecological degradation of the post-colonial era played a significant role in
                    exacerbating the damage.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>I spoke to Ambassador Heck at length on my misgivings that an Initiative would
                    accomplish much because the Sahelian governments were not about to return to the
                    old colonial restrictions. New sorghum varieties, stockpiled emergency food, and
                    reforestation projects would certainly help, but would not be decisive. I told
                    him that we were all being driven by the past disaster and the high costs
                    involved to do something. There was a determination to do something quick to
                    show that we cared. Unless the Sahelian governments were willing to take some
                    draconian steps to curb harmful practices against the ecology, what we did would
                    probably be largely negated. I was pessimistic that the Sahel Initiative would
                    focus on doing what might be effective in the long run. I saw mostly short-term
                    palliatives, namely quick-impact projects. Doug listened to me patiently, but I
                    saw that he was under orders, so I stopped offering my opinion. There was so
                    much interest in Washington, Paris, Bonn, Brussels, the UN, and especially the
                    Sahel. There was going to be enormous money poured into the area. There was talk
                    of a “Marshall Plan” for the Sahel. New proposals were made every day.
                    Universities, NGOs, contractors, think tanks, governmental development agencies,
                    and others got involved. People flew into Niamey to discuss projects and
                    funding. Nigerien officials flew to Paris, New York, Brussels, Ottawa, and to
                    Sahelian capitals for consultations and conferences. People were coming and
                    going. Unlimited funds seemed to be available for travel and conferences. Some
                    of the pilot projects were funded. Officials were upbeat. Western money and
                    technology were going to turn things around in the Sahel! Even if Doug had
                    wanted to take a more gradual approach, he would have been overruled.</p>
                <p>We worked well together in the short time we were both in Niamey. He was a
                    dedicated professional, but also had a good way with people. He was respected
                    from the very beginning. Within a few months, Doug was also very popular with a
                    wide circle of friends. I liked him immediately. We became personal friends.
                    Although he is deceased, I am still very close to his wife, who was a
                    professional who had to give up her career while he was ambassador. Just the
                    past year I worked with her on several occasions in connection with refugee
                    issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I know Ernie very well. We served together in Saigon.
                        Wwere quite good friends. I had a long interview with Ernie.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: She's a fine person.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>BUCHE: Looking back from the perspective of some fifteen-years' distance, I see
                    that hundreds of millions of dollars went into the Sahel. Trees were planted,
                    more wells dug, herds were replenished, storage facilities built, roads
                    constructed, better sorghum varieties developed, weather forecasting improved,
                    and agricultural monitoring stations scattered throughout the area. Some
                    Sahelian government officials and merchants are living much better as the result
                    of the Initiative. The desert is still moving southward, but slower. Nomadic
                    life has been abandoned by many. Many of the nomads of Niger have died out,
                    gotten jobs, or settled in the bidonvilles of Agad�s, Niamey, Zinder, or
                    elsewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Somewhat the same thing happened in Saudi Arabia and
                        elsewhere.The Bedu.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: The French and other Europeans have long been fascinated with the nomads
                    of the Sahel. I was intrigued by their life style, but I was not a strong
                    advocate of preserving their culture at all costs. The West performed a
                    Herculean task to bring the nomads food, fodder, and water. Despite our efforts,
                    many of them died. They could have moved southward earlier where there was food
                    available. After the first year of the drought, the Niger Government pleaded
                    with the nomads to stay in the south, where they could more easily be assisted
                    if the drought continued. Most of them ignored the Government's pleas or the
                    meteorological warnings of more drought and moved northward in their usual
                    transhumance patterns expecting the rains to come. When the rains again failed,
                    the nomads and their flocks were so weak that they could not reach the southern
                    lands without heavy casualties. The victims were mostly the very old and the
                    very young. When conditions became critical, the old people voluntarily stayed
                    behind to allow the young a better chance of survival. When the water and food
                    were nearly at an end, the adults abandoned the infants and those children who
                    could not keep up with the march. That is how the nomads survived hard times.
                    The camps were largely populated by nomads between the ages of five and fifty.
                    There were, of course, some younger children and older adults, but not many.</p>
                <p>It was not politically correct for diplomats to comment that if the nomads had
                    not been so stubborn in following their traditional way of life, many more would
                    have been saved. The journalists, however, had no such compunction, and asked
                    the question frequently of the drought victims in the camps. They said all was
                    in the hands of Allah. Allah wanted them to follow their traditional ways, and
                    so they depended on Allah to take care of them. If drought or other misfortune
                    befell them, that was the will of Allah. There was nothing they could do. They
                    desperately wanted to return to the desert and would do so if they could obtain
                    animals to sustain them. Part of the assistance money from the Sahel Fund went
                    to replenish the herds of the nomads. Some nomads, along with their
                    newly-acquired animals, moved out of the camps and back to their old life. Sahel
                    Fund money also was used to train nomads for a more sedentary life. I later
                    learned that the success rate was low for the adults in this group. They had no
                    previous schooling and were thus not only illiterate, but also ill at ease in
                    the twentieth century. Their children, however, were more successful in adapting
                    to urban life.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>Before moving on to speaking about my next assignment, I want to include a few
                    remarks and observations about our social and family life in Niamey. Anike and I
                    found the Nigeriens in Niamey generally pleasant and agreeable. They have a
                    quiet, subtle approach to life. They were a great contrast to their neighbors to
                    the south, the Nigerians. Our circle of friends and acquaintances was mainly
                    Government officials, other diplomats, UN people, and the small American
                    community - Embassy, Peace Corps, and missionaries.</p>
                <p>Our children found life in Niger more difficult than Blantyre or Washington. They
                    spent four months at the Cathedral Day School in Washington while Anike and I
                    were learning French at the FSI. They liked the school so much that they did not
                    want to leave at 5 o'clock when we came to take them home. School in Niamey was
                    quite different. John and Christina did not know French and did not know any of
                    their classmates. Despite the special attention given to them by their teachers
                    (Madame Maouri was especially kind to the children), they had a rough time
                    adjusting. Not only was the weather terribly hot (no air-conditioning in the
                    school), but there were no swings, slides, or toys at the school. The school's
                    recreation area was an large expanse of sand. At recess, the boys played soccer,
                    and the girls watched. Since John had never played soccer before, he was left
                    out. Christina's lack of French at the beginning meant that she could not
                    converse with the other kids. Anike recalls visiting the school one day during
                    the recess and seeing John kneeling on the ground using his shoes as two toy
                    trucks driving through the sand. Our children learned French rapidly and
                    adjusted well. They seemed to forget their school in Washington with its many
                    enjoyable facilities. At least they no longer asked why they could not go back
                    to Cathedral Day School.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>Through our children, we got to know some teachers and parents from the French
                    School. As our French conversational ability improved, we expanded our contacts.
                    Without French, there could be little communication with the Nigeriens. I knew
                    of only three Nigerien officials who spoke English. (One was President Diori. He
                    understood English quite well, but hesitated to use the language in official
                    discussions.) Because of the lack of “cultural” facilities and events such as
                    theaters, musical performances, and cinemas, social life centered around
                    traveling performers sponsored by embassies and held in the French, Chinese,
                    American, or German Cultural Centers. The American Community ran a recreation
                    center that included a snack bar, swimming pool, two lighted tennis courts, and
                    an open shed for showing films. Anike was the manager for one year. We were
                    generous about allowing guests to use the facility. An American member could
                    bring up to six guests at a time. Other embassies had similar facilities. There
                    were only a half dozen restaurants catering to the foreign community in Niamey.
                    There were two open-air restaurants, Vietnamese and Middle Eastern, along the
                    Niger River. They were attractive places to visit in the evenings. There were
                    also two discos favored by Westerners. I found the discos too loud, too crowded,
                    and too smoky. After several visits, I stopped going, despite invitations from
                    my diplomatic and UN colleagues to join them after a reception or dinner. Mixing
                    in with the international social circles were former French colons. They had
                    lived in Niger or elsewhere in French West Africa for many decades. They often
                    married or lived with local women and had children. They were interesting,
                    intelligent, and skilled in surviving. They flourished under French colonialism,
                    Diori, Kountche, and Kountche's successor. There may still be some living in
                    Niamey today, unless they left for France for better medical care.</p>

                <p>Niamey was a fascinating assignment. I found the situation at the Embassy and in
                    the country much more challenging than I had expected. There were more crises
                    than I had imagined would come my way. As Charge for nearly a year, I had to
                    deal with the drought, the PNG episode, the PCV death and other medical problems
                    of the Volunteers, and the coup d'etat, and the aftermath. I was confident I
                    handled the situations in a competent, professional manner. The Desk Officer or
                    his boss, the Office Director, in the Department on many occasions sent letters
                    (an official-informal, as we called them) praising the way I was running the
                    Embassy and responding to the crises. (Since the Nigerien telephone system was
                    useless for communicating much beyond local calls, we were dependent on mail and
                    telegrams.) As my tour of duty came to an end in Niamey, I had every expectation
                    of being promoted by the Department for my excellent performance both in Malawi
                    and Niger. I was shocked when my name did not appear on the promotion list. I
                    wrote to Personnel and asked discreetly why I was not promoted. I also asked for
                    a copy of my performance evaluation written by the Office Director for West
                    African Affairs. Before Personnel could reply, a long-delayed, unclassified
                    diplomatic pouch arrived at the Embassy with a copy of my evaluation. I knew
                    instantly why I was not on the promotion list. The Office Director had written
                    only one short paragraph about my work as Charge. It was highly complimentary
                    with several nicely-chosen adjectives and adverbs, but there was no detail other
                    than to say I performed magnificently when the Embassy and Niger were under the
                    stress of time drought and a coup d'etat. The evaluator wrote apologetically
                    that he had been named Ambassador to Senegal and in the rush to prepare for
                    confirmation by the Senate and to get to post, he had neglected to do the
                    required “efficiency reports” on the dozen Ambassadors and Charges in his area.
                    When Personnel had reminded him of his neglect, he wrote whatever he could
                    recall while sitting in Embassy Dakar. I was upset that he did not bother to
                    send me his draft and ask whether I could add some details. In those days, there
                    was not much a Foreign Service Officer could do in such circumstances. We were
                    expected to go along without protest with the “System,” and if we did, we were
                    told the System would eventually right the wrongs and take care of its own. (The
                    next year, I gained my promotion!)</p>
                <p>I left Niamey with a sense of accomplishment. I looked upon my tour there with
                    satisfaction and pride. I was ready for another assignment, this time outside of
                    Africa. I needed a change of continents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you left there in 1975.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>BUCHE: Embassy Bonn! I had had enough of Africa for the moment. My whole career,
                    except for those initial two years in Canada, was spent in Africa, on the
                    Ethiopian Desk, or at Northwestern University studying African issues. Niger was
                    especially hard on the children. They needed to go to a good school. My German
                    and French language ability was pretty good, so I bid on several openings in
                    Western Europe.</p>
                <p>While I was trying to find a position in Western Europe, a colleague in Personnel
                    was trying to assign me to the Foreign Service Institute to learn Romanian so I
                    could go to Embassy Bucharest to be the Political Counselor. She thought she was
                    doing me a favor, even though I tried to convince her I preferred to serve much
                    further west in Europe. She told me there were some officers specializing in
                    Eastern Europe who would have given the tip of their little finger to have that
                    opportunity! She was right, but I really did not want to serve in Eastern Europe
                    at that juncture of my life. (Romania was ruled by one of the most brutal of the
                    Communist dictators, Ceausescu, although he was at that time our “darling”
                    because of his refusal to go along with some of the Soviet policies.) I did not
                    want to go from a geographic desert to an intellectual/political desert in a
                    Communist police state. Not only did I have to convince my friend in Personnel
                    that I did not want the honor or prestige of serving in Bucharest, but I had to
                    turn a deaf ear to our neighbor in Niamey who also tried to convince me that
                    Bucharest would be great for my career. Our next-door neighbor was an American
                    citizen (married to a French woman) who had come to Niger as the UN Development
                    Program Representative after serving in Bucharest in the same capacity. His
                    pitch was similar to that coming from Personnel: John, here is your opportunity
                    - things are going to change in Eastern Europe, and you can be there. He was so
                    fascinated with Bucharest. I told him eventually things will have to change, but
                    I did not want to go there at this stage. It was a Stalinist r�gime. I did not
                    want to have to live and work in Rumania under the constant surveillance of the
                    secret police. I knew I was turning down a good career opportunity, but I was
                    adamant. I would take my chances.</p>
                <p>Shortly before departing Niamey for home leave, I got a telegram saying would I
                    be interested in the position as the Counselor for Consular Affairs in Bonn with
                    supervisory responsibilities for consular offices throughout the Federal
                    Republic of Germany? My immediate reaction was YES. I drafted a reply and called
                    Anike to make sure she would be pleased with Bonn. She was, of course. I sent my
                    acceptance cable. The matter was wrapped up within a few weeks. I had gambled
                    and won.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>Before starting my job in Bonn, I had to go through an intensive retraining in
                    consular affairs in Washington, since it had been some time since I had actually
                    been a consular officer. While in Washington, I learned the reason I got the
                    job. Ambassador Hillenbrand had made a request to the Office Director for German
                    Affairs, David Anderson, for a consular officer who had political experience and
                    “feeling”, management skills, and fluent German. There were numerous consular
                    officers contending for the post. David pushed my candidacy, despite the fact
                    that the Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of Consular Affairs, Barbara Watson,
                    wanted the Bonn position to go to a career consular officer. The Bonn post was
                    traditionally a reward for senior consular officers. David had a rough time with
                    the assignment process and succeeded only because the others did not meet the
                    criteria set by Ambassador Hillenbrand. He was dissatisfied with the attitudes
                    and service provided by some of the older, “hardened” consular officers in
                    several of our Consulates General, as well as in the Embassy. He wanted a
                    supervisory officer with the right attitude and management experience to ensure
                    that the consular officers, and particularly the Foreign Service Nationals,
                    provided efficient, timely, and friendly service to Germans, Americans, and
                    third-country nationals, while, of course, upholding the regulations and laws.
                    He (and his Deputy Chief of Mission) had seen too many instances of haughty and
                    disdainful attitudes, especially by the German Foreign Service Nationals toward
                    persons seeking consular services. He felt that some of the American consular
                    officers and their German support staff had subordinated the concept of service
                    and helpfulness to the attitude that the public should accommodate to the wishes
                    and preferences of the officials. What really bothered him was to learn that in
                    some consular offices, services would be refused fifteen or twenty minutes
                    before the posted closing times so that the officials could leave promptly for
                    lunch or for home when the official closing minute was reached. One of my tasks
                    was to change attitudes and practices.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is very German bureaucratic approach. You served in
                        Bonfrom when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: It was August 1975 until August 1978. When I arrived in Bonn and met with
                    Ambassador Hillenbrand and the DCM, Frank Cash, they told me specifically of
                    their unhappiness with the way consular services were performed, particularly in
                    Frankfurt. I was expected to use my management ability and leadership to put
                    things on a service-oriented basis. Frank Cash told me bluntly: “I will judge
                    your performance by the number of complaints the Ambassador or I receive about
                    consular services. I responded that there were so many things I cannot control.
                    He said, “But you will, I'm sure of it. Improve the record.” So basically, these
                    were my marching orders.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>I had never served in as large an embassy as Bonn. It was overwhelming in many
                    ways. Showing up in the first staff meeting of “senior officers” was a
                    revelation. There were section chiefs, counselors, minister counselors,
                    attaches, the DCM, and the Ambassador, nearly twenty persons in all. The weekly
                    staff meeting (the next layer) brought together about forty persons. There was
                    no regularly-scheduled staff meeting of all the Americans at the Embassy. It
                    would have required the post theater to fit them all in. I soon learned how
                    hierarchical a large embassy such as Bonn was, and how large several of our
                    consulates were. I attended the various staff meetings and was fascinated with
                    the complexity and breadth of our relations with Germany. After several months,
                    I decided that the weekly staff meetings were sufficient, unless there was a
                    consular issue to discuss. I think I did a much better job as the supervisory
                    consular officer by being available for calls and for the public, rather than
                    spend an hour each day in the Senior Officers staff meeting.</p>
                <p>Another new aspect of serving in a large embassy was observing and participating
                    in the work of programming and assisting the many official visitors. There
                    seemed to be a constant stream of Congressmen and Senators, assistant
                    secretaries, Cabinet members, judges, academics, generals, Vice-President
                    Mondale (twice during my posting), and President Carter. The flow of visitors
                    never stopped. The Visitors Section of the Embassy had ten employees whose
                    primary task was to service official visitors to Bonn. The administrative staff
                    of the Embassy was enormous and had every conceivable resource. The Embassy
                    could call upon the U.S. military for logistical help, if needed. The motor pool
                    was enormous. I could order a car with a driver for official use at any time of
                    the day or night. I learned that the German Government paid for the Embassy cars
                    and trucks. The State Department had such budgetary problems that Washington
                    could not afford to pay for more than a few new cars each year. The solution was
                    simple. We told the German Government that the cars were needed for our Mission
                    in Berlin. Since the Germans were responsible for paying the administrative
                    costs of the Berlin Mission, several hundred cars would be ordered each year by
                    the Mission, paid for by the Germans, and then driven from Berlin to Embassy
                    Bonn and to the Consulates General in Stuttgart, Munich, Bremen, or Hamburg. So
                    we all had well-stocked motor pools.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Frankfurt, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Frankfurt, of course. The Germans were so eager to have the three Allied
                    powers remain in Berlin that they picked up much of the cost. We stretched the
                    definitions of allowable items to some extent, but not so blatantly as the
                    French. In addition to the car scheme which we picked up from the French, the
                    French military would periodically rotate troops from Western Germany to Berlin
                    to have them outfitted with new uniforms and other equipment. We and the British
                    kept the Berlin purchases within bounds.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, now, you were faced with the problem of getting essentially the Consular
                    Sections to be responsive to the customer. How did you go about that?</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>BUCHE: Two ways. I decided to hold off-site consular conferences every six
                    months. I chose a US Army-owned resort hotel at Berchtesgaden for our first
                    session. Frank Cash, the DCM, and the Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs,
                    Barbara Watson, also participated. She delivered a strong message. “Complaints
                    are coming from all over the world that American citizens are not being served
                    well by our consuls. This must stop. You must improve your service to
                    Americans!” She threatened that the careers of consular officers would be
                    negatively affected if attitudes and performance did not change for the better.
                    The main culprits were not the officers, but the locally-hired personnel. The
                    FSNs were too often allowed free rein to deal with the public as they wished,
                    with little supervision from the Consular Officers. Service with a smile,
                    flexibility, and going that proverbial “extra mile” were not in the operational
                    vocabularies of some of the FSNs. They worked for the American Government, but
                    their attitudinal role models seemed to be the Prussian bureaucracy.</p>
                <p>Ms. Watson also proclaimed a new requirement that every American prisoner held in
                    German jails and prisons had to be visited once a month by a consular officer.
                    This was to be the policy worldwide. Previously the frequency of prison visits
                    was left to the discretion of the consuls. There was strong opposition from some
                    of the senior consuls in our meeting. “We can't do this; we don't have the
                    people.” She answered, “You have sixty days to find a way to do this. If you
                    need more money for your travel budgets, let Washington know.” She then turned
                    to me and said, “Mr. Buche, you are the supervising consular officer, so you
                    will see that this is done. I will hold you responsible.” I suspected she still
                    had some animosity toward me because I had defeated her candidate for the
                    prestigious Bonn position. I calmly replied to her that I would see to it that
                    all the German posts complied within sixty days to the new requirement. All of
                    us in the room knew that monthly visits to 300-400 prisoners would be difficult
                    to carry out without additional vice-consuls, and to obtain incremental
                    personnel would take almost two years. Most of the incarcerated American were in
                    Bavaria, held in a dozen prisons. Since the Munich Consulate General was
                    responsible for Bavaria, the most difficult adjustment from the new order fell
                    on Consul Ira Levy. He showed great management skill and ingenuity in working
                    out methods to carry out the command. The others had to adjust and shift
                    workloads, but their tasks were not as complicated. Frank Cash informed all the
                    Consuls General (the supervisors of the Consuls) of the new requirement from
                    Washington and told them to do whatever was necessary to carry out the
                    directive. I then visited all the Consulates to work out details. I was able to
                    report to Ms. Watson that we had met her deadline! The second tool I used to
                    ensure better service was the annual performance review of the individual
                    officers. I offered to serve as the reviewing officer for the reports, if the
                    rated officer so wished. I was not the direct supervisor of any of the officers
                    in the outlying post, so I could not be a “rating officer”. I did, however, send
                    evaluation reports on each of the officers to his or her direct supervisor for
                    inclusion within the report. Several of the officers took up my offer to serve
                    as the reviewer of the report of the direct supervisor.</p>

                <p>Fortunately, the main problem was resolved by a change of personnel. One of the
                    older, consular officers became ill and was hospitalized and eventually retired.
                    Another left in a normal rotation. They were replaced by officers with a much
                    more positive attitude. The new officers approached the job in the way the
                    Ambassador, Frank Cash, and I desired. Things were looking up, except in
                    Frankfurt. There were still several embittered, old consular officers who had
                    heard and seen it all, and were not about to change. They were also being goaded
                    by some of the local German staff not to yield to the Ambassador's and my “smile
                    and charm campaign” (as they described our efforts to provide better
                    service).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm just curious. What could you do in the Frankfurt
                        situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Well, it took a little longer, but we found solutions. The most
                    significant instrument for change at Frankfurt was the quadrennial post
                    inspection. In early 1976, all the German posts were inspected by officials from
                    the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of State. The Ambassador,
                    Frank Cash, and I shared with the Inspectors our general concerns about the
                    quality of consular services. During subsequent discussions with the Inspectors,
                    I suggested they should observe first hand over an extended period how the
                    Consular Section of the Consulate General Frankfurt interacted with the public.
                    I also told them that I thought the organization of the Consular Section was
                    flawed. I also raised the issue of the delineation of the Frankfurt Consular
                    District. Regarding the organization, there were three chiefs, one for visa
                    operations, one for passport operations, and one for special consular services,
                    and they all reported directly to the Deputy Consul General. The DCG also had
                    other section heads reporting to him. No one person was really responsible for
                    overall, daily consular operations. The problem with the consular district was
                    that Frankfurt served the States of Hesse, Rheinland-Pfalz, and several others,
                    but not Bavaria. Yet northern Bavaria reached to within twenty miles of
                    Frankfurt. (Incidentally, my great-great grandmother lived in the northernmost
                    part of Bavaria, Hoerstein, before migrating to New Albany, Indiana.) Our
                    Consulate General in Munich (which served Bavaria) was some two hundred miles
                    away.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>After spending several weeks in Frankfurt, the Inspectors returned to Bonn and
                    discussed their findings on the consular side with me. They agreed with my point
                    of view about the structure of the section and the interaction with the public.
                    Their inspection report recommended that a new position be created for a Chief
                    of the Consular Section. Since this person would not be on board for at least a
                    year, there was no immediate problem regarding the three incumbent sub-section
                    chiefs. They were all scheduled to retire within two years. The Consul General
                    and the Deputy Consul General were told by the Inspectors of their negative
                    findings about consular services. (Both had been told about the very same
                    problems by the Embassy, but they did not take our concerns very seriously,
                    since their own staff members insinuated that we were exaggerating the problem.)
                    The DCG began to focus more on the consular issues, and so there were
                    improvements. Fortunately there were some young officers in Frankfurt who were
                    not pleased with the prevailing attitudes of their bosses or of the FSNs toward
                    the public. I stayed in contact with them and encouraged them. They were saying,
                    in effect, “John, you're pushing on an open door, as far as we are concerned. We
                    try to do something beyond the call of duty, and our boss says, 'To hell with
                    that - it's ten minutes past closing time. Don't issue the visa. Tell him to
                    come back tomorrow.' or 'No, don't serve that person because he is from outside
                    our consular district. Tell him to go to Munich.'” The Inspectors also agreed
                    with the approach on the consular district issue which the Embassy was
                    advocating. Serve people from Northern Bavaria, if legally permitted. To wit,
                    issue visas, passports, and provide some other services. Only notarials and
                    official certifications were not legally permitted to be performed out of
                    district. After the Inspectors weighed in, Frankfurt officially changed its
                    policies and provided services for clients in Northern Bavaria. This was a
                    breakthrough because there were several large U.S. Army units stationed in the
                    area. The soldiers and their dependents no longer had to travel to Munich for
                    most consular services. The Ambassador and Frank Cash were delighted with the
                    backing from the Inspectors and the subsequent changes in attitudes at
                    Frankfurt. We achieved our goal of providing excellent consular services at all
                    the posts. People began to note the change. I received kudos from Frank Cash and
                    the Ambassador, as well as from Washington. The accolades I most appreciated,
                    however, were from my colleagues, especially the younger officers.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>The assignment to Embassy Bonn was rewarding in so many ways. Professionally, it
                    expanded my horizons considerably. Although I had served in two small embassies
                    as DCM and as Charge, the extent of our national interests in Malawi and Niger
                    was quite limited. Germany, however, was a focal point of our global strategy.
                    The Embassy was a key component in carrying out that strategy. As a member of
                    the Ambassador's “Management Team”, I played a role in the day-to-day activities
                    in furthering our national interests. Making sure that our consular activities
                    were carried out properly was considered important to the Ambassador. That is
                    the reason he fought so hard with the Washington bureaucracy to fill the
                    position with an officer of my background and proven capabilities, rather than a
                    “business-as-usual” career consular type. Ambassador Hillenbrand was fully aware
                    that every working day several thousand Germans came to our Consulates seeking
                    services. He was determined that they would be served in a professional,
                    efficient, and friendly manner. I also had responsibilities to deal with foreign
                    members of the diplomatic and consular corps accredited to the Federal Republic
                    of Germany. On several occasions, I was the official contact between the Embassy
                    and the East Germans on issues involving Allied access to Berlin. Washington
                    made the decision to deal with certain contentious issues on a Consul-to-Consul
                    basis, rather than at the Political Counselor level. Even when I was not
                    directly involved in an issue, I could observe up close how the Embassy team was
                    handling the matter.</p>
                <p>I was impressed with the way Ambassador Hillenbrand, and later, Ambassador
                    Stoessel managed various crises or important issues. They were both superb
                    diplomats, with a breadth of experience relating to Europe. I liked and admired
                    both of them and got along well with them. Hillenbrand was the more outspoken of
                    the two. His analyses of events and developments in Germany were accurate and
                    were reported straight. He did not gloss over differences between the U.S. and
                    Germany, particularly on issues where we were attempting to push the Germans
                    into taking positions, with which they disagreed. Since Secretary of State
                    Kissinger fancied himself as the expert on Germany, he often took issue with
                    what Hillenbrand reported or advocated. Kissinger eventually forced Hillenbrand
                    to retire.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>Walter Stoessel was transferred to Bonn from Moscow. Not only did I have a good
                    working relationship with Ambassador Stoessel, but we were frequently together
                    on the tennis courts. Walter and his wife liked to play tennis, and their
                    playing level was about equal to Anike's and mine. We played twice a week mixed
                    doubles, Stoessel and Anike on one team and Mary Ann and myself on the other. A
                    Stoessel and a Buche always won (or lost). We got know them very well over the
                    two years. After the game, Walter was relaxed and would often like to talk about
                    something on his mind. He and I would sit together, while Mary Ann and Anike
                    carried on their conversation elsewhere. What was on his mind was usually a
                    current problem. I served as a sounding board. He sensed I was very discreet, so
                    he trusted me. He knew I would hold whatever he told me in strict confidence. I
                    was reluctant to offer advice on complex diplomatic issues to a person of such
                    great experience and intelligence. That was not his intention. I sometimes was
                    asked directly for my views, but mostly Walter simply wanted to get something
                    off his chest. By telling me what he thought about a situation or problem, he
                    clarified in his own mind what he should do. Later I would read the cable he had
                    sent to Washington offering his views or solutions. Or if it were a matter for
                    him to handle, I would learn that he had taken such and such a decision, just as
                    he had suggested to me he would do. I learned much about diplomacy from
                    the-post-tennis sessions with Walter. I realized what problems of our own making
                    (the US Government) that someone such as an ambassador to Paris, to Moscow, or
                    to Bonn has to resolve. It is difficult enough to run a huge embassy and to be
                    responsible for US relations with the host country, but a big part of that job
                    is trying to figure out what Washington is trying to do, where a change or shift
                    in policy is leading, why they are going there, what they think they will
                    achieve, what are the chances of success, and what will be the results if we are
                    not successful. I think this is what was very often on Ambassador Stoessel's
                    mind. He was puzzled or uncertain about an issue and wanted to think out loud
                    about how to respond. I certainly appreciated his confidence in my discretion,
                    as well as the chance to share his thinking on some big (and quite minor)
                    issues.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the problems of the first year in dealing with some stubborn
                    personalities, our tour at Bonn was really enjoyable. It was rewarding in so
                    many ways, culturally, gastronomically, intellectually, and professionally. The
                    children attended an excellent French school, and they liked the experience. It
                    was so much better in their eyes than the school in Niamey. We lived in a
                    comfortable apartment close to the Rhine and surrounded by green areas. There
                    were clubs, theaters, restaurants, recreation facilities, a military post
                    exchange, and a library on the grounds. We were within an hour's drive to
                    Cologne, and other interesting Rhineland cities, the Belgian border, or to the
                    Mosel wine district. We took advantage of the fabulous travel opportunities to
                    visit throughout Germany and into Belgium, France, and especially the
                    Netherlands, where Anike had many close relatives. After our two tours in
                    Africa, we felt we had arrived in a tourist's paradise. We explored the menus of
                    some excellent restaurants and treated ourselves to some fine wines.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>We knew a few Americans and Germans from our previous tours, and met other
                    interesting people at the Embassy or in the constituent posts. (Because of my
                    country-wide responsibilities, I traveled to the other posts in the Federal
                    Republic on a regular basis.) Some of the colleagues whom I met during my Bonn
                    assignment have remained close friends to this day. Doug Hunter was in charge of
                    the Consular Section in Bremen. I met him at the first consular conference and
                    was impressed by his contribution to the discussions. He offered positive,
                    practical ways of reaching the goals the Ambassador sought. I was also
                    immediately attracted to him. We worked so well together over the next thirty
                    some months. There was never a problem or complaint about any aspect of the
                    consular operations in Bremen. I looked forward to my visits to that post, since
                    spending time there was such a pleasure, both professionally and socially.
                    Little did I realize at the time that we would both be assigned to the U.S.
                    Mission in Geneva or that we would spend years together in the Refugee
                    Program/Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration in Washington. Other
                    long-standing friends from Bonn are Dick and Sally Smyser. He was the Political
                    Counselor. We got to know each other through work, but our friendship developed
                    through shared cultural and intellectual interests. Several years later, we were
                    both involved in refugee issues. He came to Geneva as the United Nations Deputy
                    High Commissioner for Refugees, while we were posted there. There were other
                    American colleagues from the Bonn era whom we still see occasionally in
                    Washington. On the German side, we met Gunter and Christine Joetze, when he was
                    Ambassador to Niger. We continued our friendship in Bonn, where he was assigned
                    to the section of the Foreign Office dealing with the Four-Power Negotiations,
                    and later in Vienna, where he was the Head of the German Delegation to the
                    Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).</p>

                <p>BUCHE: I had hoped to go to Salzburg as the Consul, but the Consulate was going
                    to be closed within two years. Also, Salzburg was an eagerly-sought post for a
                    last tour. The Consular Affairs Bureau controlled the selection process, so I
                    was facing some big obstacles in obtaining the position. The CA bureaucrats had
                    not forgotten how I had muscled out one of their own to obtain the Bonn posting.
                    Although the post was going to be closed in a year or two, they intended to send
                    one of their consular-cone officers to Salzburg, and not some interloper from
                    the political cone. So although my name was thrown into the hat, I was told,
                    “Forget it, John. You have been blackballed, and you're not going to a
                    consular-cone designated post.” So I was left without an assignment, until I got
                    a call at home in Bonn, shortly before I was intending to return to Washington
                    without an onward assignment. I was asked whether I would be interested in the
                    U.S. Mission to the United Nations in Geneva. And I said, “Yes.” My personnel
                    counselor explained the position. It was the number two slot in the Refugee and
                    Migration Affairs Section. I was vague on what my duties would encompass, but I
                    was thrilled at the idea of going to Geneva. We had close friends there who were
                    with us in Ethiopia, Art and Doni Stillman. We had stayed in touch with them and
                    had visited them once from Bonn. We knew they liked Geneva, and it was a
                    beautiful city. I figured I could not go wrong by accepting the position.
                    Besides there was nothing else on the horizon. I did not know much about the
                    U.S. Government's refugee program, except that I helped a dozen or more
                    Ethiopian refugees, when I was in Bonn. I had arranged for them to go to
                    Frankfurt to be processed by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). I
                    was told I would be brought back to Washington and be given an orientation on
                    what my duties were to be in Geneva. I asked why I had not seen the position
                    listed in the periodic cables sent to the posts to help the officers with the
                    bidding process for onward assignments. I was told there was a sudden vacancy (a
                    retirement), and the position had not yet been posted. The Personnel Bureau had
                    decided to make a quick internal search for a candidate and ask him or her
                    whether there was any interest. My counselor had read what Ambassadors
                    Hillenbrand and Stoessel and Frank Cash had written in my annual “efficiency
                    report” (the EER), and decided I was the person for the job. And so that is how
                    I was assigned to Geneva. Little did I realize at the time how pivotal that
                    assignment would be for my future career, both in the Foreign Service and

                <p>This is the 15th of December, 1999, the Ides of December. John, yowere in Geneva
                    from 1978 to -</p>
                <p>BUCHE: From 1978 to 1982.</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>Q: When you went to Washington before starting off in Geneva, what were you
                    hearing about refugee affairs and what you were going to be dealing with?</p>
                <p>BUCHE: When I went to Washington, I was told that refugees were becoming a more
                    important aspect of U.S. foreign policy and that there were discussions underway
                    with Congress to set up a new bureau in the Department for refugee affairs. In
                    the meantime, refugee affairs were being handled in the Human Rights Bureau,
                    which had been set up by President Carter. The Bureau was under Pat Darian, the
                    Assistant Secretary. I also learned about the budgeting for refugee affairs
                    within the Department. I did not realize that as a Cold War holdover, the budget
                    for refugee affairs was separate from the State Department's regular budget. I
                    did not know all of the ins and outs of why that distinction was made back in
                    the 1950's, but the exception was still valid. There was the State Department
                    budget, and there was the budget for the Office of Refugee Affairs. I think the
                    intention was to isolate the refugee budget from the partisan battles over the
                    State Department's budget. Refugee issues had become a non-partisan Cold War
                    requirement, and Congress decided to handle it in that fashion. I learned what
                    was going to be required of us in Geneva, as far as projections concerning
                    refugee numbers and the funds needed to process and care for them. I learned
                    about the international humanitarian organizations we would be dealing with in
                    Geneva: the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR); the International Committee
                    of the Red Cross (ICRC); the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red
                    Crescent (IFRC); and the International Organization for Migration (IOM). (At the
                    time, IOM was named the InterGovernmental Committee for European Migration and
                    subsequently, the InterGovernmental Committee for Migration.)</p>
                <p>I went to Geneva, and within a few days after arriving, I was told I would be the
                    acting chief of the section since the Counselor for Refugee Affairs, Ed Brennan,
                    had just been diagnosed with cancer, and he left to return to Washington for
                    medical treatment. Doug Hunter, whom I knew from my time in Bonn (he was the
                    Consul in Bremen) arrived in Geneva at the same time. So we two newly-arrived
                    officers were to take over responsibilities for an expanding program for
                    refugees from Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union and liaison responsibilities
                    with the international organizations for the program for refugees from Southeast
                    Asia. The SEA program was growing at a fast pace as more and more people began
                    to leave Vietnam in boats. This was 1978, and the fall of Saigon and the
                    collapse oSouth Vietnam occurred in 1975.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a continuing flow?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>BUCHE: Yes, a continuing flow. They were coming out in ever-larger numbers. The
                    outflow seemed to become larger in the spring and summer of 1978 than it was
                    right after the fall. The Vietnamese Government allowed this to happen. All
                    sorts of Vietnamese were getting involved in renting, selling, or stealing
                    boats, and selling places on the boats to people who wanted out of the country.
                    The numbers were really quite large. This was quite a concern to the United
                    States, as well as to some of our allies in Southeast Asia - the Philippines,
                    Indonesia, Thailand, and Hong Kong. The boat people were landing in these
                    countries, but none of the first-asylum countries wanted to keep them
                    permanently. They were obliged to offer asylum because of the Refugee
                    Conventions they had signed, but they decided that it was not in their national
                    interests to offer permanent resettlement to the refugees. When the numbers were
                    relatively small, they took them in and requested the U.S., Canada, and
                    Australia (traditional countries of immigration) to resettle them. That
                    arrangement worked for a while, but as the numbers increased, we and the other
                    resettlement countries did not keep up with in influx. The refugee camps became
                    overcrowded. The first asylum countries began to refuse to allow the refugees to
                    land. They gave them additional fuel, food, and fresh water and pushed their
                    boats back into the sea. The U.S. Government stepped up its rate of acceptance
                    and began to asnon-traditional immigration countries to take in Southeast Asian
                    refugees. Some non-traditional immigration countries had been resettling SEA
                    refugees since 1975.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I imagine France would be in that category.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Yes, it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Proportionately they have more Vietnamese than any other
                        country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: I think that is correct. As the former colonial power in that part of the
                    world, France had a long tradition of accepting Laotians, Cambodians, and
                    Vietnamese. The French were, of course, taking in refugees who had some
                    connections with the old “patrie,” i.e. those who had served in the French
                    colonial administration or military, had attended French schools, or had close
                    relatives in France. The non-traditional resettlement countries, such as the UK,
                    Germany, Austria, Italy, and the Nordics were quite reluctant to take in
                    Vietnamese because they were already seeing increased influxes of Eastern
                    Europeans. The U.S. Mission in Geneva was heavily engaged in working with the
                    international organizations in that city, as well as with the other diplomatic
                    missions to coordinate the myriad problems involved in caring for, processing,
                    and resettling Eastern European and Southeast Asian refugees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to know, where did you fit in? What actually were
                        yodoing in Geneva?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>BUCHE: I will try to describe the work of the Mission and my owrole. The Mission
                    was a hybrid creation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it United Nations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: No, it was an American diplomatic post accredited to the United Nations
                    and other international organizations, instead of to a country. The internal
                    structure was similar to any large American Embassy. There was an Ambassador,
                    DCM, and various sections headed by Counselors. I was the Acting Counselor of
                    the Refugee and Migration Section. We had nine Foreign Service Nationals in the
                    Section. They were responsible for formulating budgets, auditing the
                    Non-Governmental Organizations which we funded, keeping a central registry of
                    refugees whom we were assisting under the U.S. Refugee Resettlement Program, and
                    liaising with the international humanitarian organizations on funding and budget
                    issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were under an ambassador and had overall
                        responsibility fodoing what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Yes, I was under an ambassador. The Mission was set up with an economic
                    section, a political section, an economic section, a small consular section, and
                    as mentioned above, a refugee and migration section. There was also a legal
                    section in the Mission because of the legal and treaty aspects of our membership
                    in the various international organizations. There was also a CIA station
                    attached to the Mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were your ambassadors?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>BUCHE: William Van den Heuvel was our first ambassador. He was a political
                    appointee from New York and had come from the humanitarian world. After he made
                    his career and fortune as a lawyer, he went into humanitarian work. He had been
                    associated with the International Rescue Committee, Amnesty International, and
                    the UN Association. He was quite knowledgeable about refugee affairs and the
                    international organizations we were dealing with. Ambassador Van den Heuvel was
                    like a gift of God to me because I was just learning the nuts and bolts of the
                    job. He and the DCM, Roger Sorenson, were deeply involved in refugee issues
                    before Doug Hunter and I arrived, so we had excellent guidance on what needed to
                    be done. After about a year, Van den Heuvel resigned and was replaced by a
                    career diplomat, Gerald Helman. He brought Don Eller with him to Geneva as his
                    DCM. (Roger went to Rome as head of our Mission to the UN Food and Agricultural
                    Organization.) When Reagan became President, he replaced Ambassador Helman with
                    a political crony, Geoffrey Schwaeb. Schwaeb was the Chairman of May Department
                    Stores and a big financial contributor to Reagan. In the spring of 1979, the
                    Refugee Counselor position at the Mission was filled by Steve Palmer. After a
                    year of running the Refugee Section, Steve was called back to Washington by the
                    Deputy Secretary for a special task and was replaced by Frank Sieverts. Frank
                    was in charge of the Section for a year, before he was recalled to Washington to
                    open up the position for Karl Beck. After several years in Geneva, Doug Hunter
                    resigned from the Foreign Service to work for IOM. He was replaced by Robert
                    Paiva, who also resigned after two years to work for IOM!</p>
                <p>Because there was so much U.S. domestic interest in refugees, the Mission was
                    actively engaged in working with the UN, the ICRC, IOM, and the NGOs. There were
                    frequent international conferences held on refugee issues. The first one was
                    three months after I arrived. The U.S. delegation was headed by Vice-President
                    Mondale. You can imagine the complexities when a Vice-President gets involved in
                    an international conference. He was there for several days. But before Mondale
                    and the official party arrived, we had teams of security people, several
                    Assistant Secretaries to conduct preliminary negotiations, dozens of
                    journalists, and additional secretaries, public affairs specialists, and
                    working-level officers from the State Department. The way these conferences
                    normally play out, much of the groundwork is done beforehand. Then the big names
                    come in from the capitals, make speeches, do some bilateral work, put the
                    finishing touches on the declarations, give press conferences or interviews on
                    the “success” of the high-level gathering, and depart.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>There were constant conferences, but fortunately only two in Geneva at the
                    Vice-Presidential level, but the idea was to push the concept of burdensharing
                    among the potential refugee-resettlement countries and to come to some sort of
                    an agreement on how to assist and to reassure the countries of first asylum,
                    Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Hong Kong that they would
                    not be stuck with tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of refugees. An
                    understanding was reached that if the first-asylum countries would take in the
                    refugees, the UN would pay for their upkeep, and then they would be resettled.
                    That meant that Congress had to be brought on board (for funding and to allow
                    the U.S. to take in tens of thousands of refugees each year). The UN High
                    Commissioner for Refugees had the responsibility to protect and care for the
                    refugees under the 1951 Refugee Convention (signed by most governments). That UN
                    agency also had the task of coordinating the understandings and speaking out
                    when parties did not adhere to what had been agreed. Of course, the UNHCR needed
                    large sums of money to carry out its mandate. This was something the UNHCR had
                    always done very well on a limited basis. With the outflow of thousands of
                    refugees daily from Vietnam, the UNHCR was not prepared to meet the burgeoning
                    crisis. They were basically Europe-oriented and were beginning to handle
                    large-scale refugee crises in Africa, but they were not staffed to handle
                    simultaneously another major crisis in Southeast Asia.</p>
                <p>They were particularly weak in the resettlement aspects, since in Europe, we, the
                    Canadians, and Australians processed our own refugees. (Israel was beginning to
                    receive large numbers of Soviet Jews, so the Jewish Resettlement Agency was also
                    involved in the processing in Europe.) The High Commissioner at the time was
                    Paul Hartling, a former Prime Minister of Denmark. He responded to the pressures
                    (and increased funding) from the U.S. and our European Allies and augmented his
                    staff to meet the worldwide crises. My office was called upon to work with the
                    UN and other humanitarian organizations to meet the crisis in Southeast Asia and
                    still manage the ever-increasing outflows of refugees from Eastern Europe and
                    the Soviet Union. While there was not the problem of the first-asylum states of
                    Europe, particularly Germany, Austria, Greece, and Italy, turning back the
                    refugees, they were also concerned that they not be stuck with large numbers.
                    They counted on us and the other resettlement countries to take most of the
                    refugees. Fortunately for the program, there was fairly wide support in the U.S.
                    for offering haven to the Eastern European refugees. This was part of the Cold
                    War mentality.</p>

                <p>BUCHE: It was August 1978, when I arrived in Geneva. The number of people coming
                    out of Eastern Europe, and asking for asylum in Germany, Switzerland, Austria,
                    Italy, and Greece had been growing by twenty to thirty percent annually since
                    1975. The U.S., the Canadians, and Australians years ago had worked out an
                    agreement to help these first asylum states by taking for resettlement most of
                    the refugees who entered Western Europe. The exceptions were the East Germans
                    (who were offered West German citizenship immediately upon reaching the country)
                    and those refugees who had close family members in Western Europe. The Canadians
                    and the Australians were looking for migrants, and we were doing it for
                    political and/or humanitarian reasons.</p>
                <p>In 1977, the U.S.S.R. began to drop many restrictions to legal emigration for
                    Jews. They were coming out of the Soviet Union by train to Vienna. The Jews
                    would be met by representatives of an American NGO, HIAS, as well as by the
                    Jewish Resettlement Agency. They would indicate their preference to go to Israel
                    or to the U.S. (or elsewhere, other than Israel). They would then either be
                    flown to Israel within a few days, or processed in Vienna for resettlement
                    elsewhere. In 1978, the overall numbers of Jews coming out of the U.S.S.R. was
                    growing dramatically, but the ratio of those choosing not to go to Israel was
                    increasing. (These were the so-called “split-offs”.) The U.S. Government
                    believed they should have a choice. This is where the Israeli Government and the
                    US Government had sharp differences. The Israeli Government maintained since the
                    Jews were coming out of Russia with visas for Israel, they should go first to
                    Israel. If they did not like living there, then they could go elsewhere. We said
                    our laws on asylum did not permit that, since once a refugee has been resettled,
                    he or she had no claim as a refugee for a second country of resettlement. This
                    issue was a bone of contention between our two Governments, especially since the
                    numbers were going up of those who decided to split off and settle in the
                    West.</p>

                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>BUCHE: We funded from our office the operations in Vienna of the organizations
                    involved in the initial questioning and processing. Once a Jew decided not to go
                    to Israel, we picked up the costs of care and maintenance of the refugee in
                    Austria, until we could resettle the person elsewhere. This was an arrangement
                    that we worked out with the Austrian Government. The Austrians agreed to be a
                    conduit, but they were not going to pay for care and maintenance or allow them
                    to stay in the country, unless they had ties with Austria. The reasoning of the
                    Austrians was completely in conformity with the Refugee Convention of 1951,
                    since the Jews had the right and a means to go to Israel. Some of them
                    eventually did stay in Austria, but not very many. My office's responsibility
                    for a refugee ceased as soon as the person was resettled either in Israel,
                    Europe, or a traditional country of immigration. Until that happened, however,
                    our office paid for care and maintenance, including clothes, pocket money,
                    health costs, school supplies for children, and burial costs in a few cases.
                    When I arrived, the Jews on our care and maintenance rolls in Austria numbered
                    about 10,000. Shortly before I departed, the numbers had risen to 30,000. We
                    worked primarily with two Jewish and two non-Jewish NGOs who were in daily
                    contact with the Jews. These former were HIAS (Hebrew Immigrant Assistance
                    Society), AJDC (American Joint Distribution Committee), and the latter were IRC
                    (International Rescue Committee), and Austria Caritas.</p>
                <p>Q: I would think that these latter organizations would shy away because, after
                    all we're talking about people who have a place to go. I would think that there
                    would have been the idea of putting their resources elsewhere.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>BUCHE: They wanted to help on an ecumenical or humanitarian basis. The IRC was
                    founded in the mid-1930s in New York to rescue Jews from Hitler's Germany. Most
                    of the Jews who broke off in Vienna and wanted to go elsewhere were helped to do
                    so by HIAS and AJDC in a partnership arrangement. But there were other NGOs
                    which were already working with the non-Jewish refugees and decided they would
                    help because, for one thing, it smoothed out the peaks and valleys of workloads.
                    The Jews were very regular in coming out of the U.S.S.R. They needed exit visas
                    and were allowed time to pack up and say good bye. While their numbers were
                    growing, we could plan in advance. Whereas the number of refugees from Eastern
                    Europe was up and down, depending on so many aspects. Very few of them actually
                    “climbed under or over the Iron Curtain”. They came out as tourists or part of
                    teams or delegations or they had permission to join family members. There were
                    some very dramatic escapes, but most of them came out in tour buses or trains
                    with permission. The non-Jewish NGOs did take some of the Jews, and we
                    encouraged them to do so. By the same token, HIAS processed some Pentecostals
                    and Evangelicals from the Soviet Union because it had a large staff of
                    Russian-speakers. Our office reviewed and approved the NGO budgets, incorporated
                    them for submission to Washington, and after the funds became available to us,
                    we apportioned the money and audited the expenditures. Because of the long
                    lead-time required by Washington for the budgets and because the budgets were
                    based on future estimations of the number of refugees each NGO would handle and
                    for how long, until they were resettled, there was a real need for intelligent
                    estimations and informed guesses. We could adjust budgets for the NGOs within
                    our overall ceiling without reference to Washington, but if we grossly
                    underestimated the overall levels of incoming refugees, we would have to go back
                    to Washington for a supplemental. Since a supplemental request to Congress was
                    acceptable only for large-scale emergencies, we were encouraged to over estimate
                    and be prepared to return the money at the end of the fiscal year to the
                    Treasury. By a combination of good estimations and favorable luck, we came very
                    close to the real numbers each year.</p>
                <p>In addition to the work in Geneva, several of our local employees in Geneva would
                    travel to the NGO field offices to audit the accounts and serve as advisers in
                    the day-to-day operations. We also used American accounting firms to audit the
                    NGOs. Once a quarter, Doug or I would visit the NGO field offices in Vienna,
                    Rome, Paris, Munich, Istanbul, Athens, or Bucharest for discussions with the
                    NGOs that we were funding. Our visits gave us a good comprehension of the “big
                    picture” of the U.S. Refugee Program in Europe, as well as acquaint us with the
                    numerous fine points and the many local variations.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>During our visits, or sometimes between visits, we would receive requests from
                    the NGOs for additional money. Sometimes it would be a request for an extra
                    $50,000 because of an unexpected influx or the funds to hire an extra driver.
                    Sometimes it was a minor sum for a new electric typewriter. We tried to be very
                    reasonable and accommodating. We knew the NGOs were operating on a shoestring in
                    many cases. We knew what their salaries were, and they were not getting rich.
                    Some of the more difficult decisions concerned medical cases. The NGOs had
                    authority to cover emergency or life-threatening situations if the host
                    government would not pay, but there were also cases where a person needed a
                    major procedure, but not on an emergency basis. Seldom would the host government
                    pay since the immediate need was not acute. We would usually consult the
                    U.S.G.-approved “panel physicians” and follow their recommendations. If the
                    refugee was being processed for Australia or Canada, we would ask the panel
                    physicians whether the operation or procedure could be safely postponed until
                    the refugee arrived in the country of resettlement. We sometimes even followed
                    that route for U.S.-bound refugees, if there was no significant danger in
                    postponing the operation, because refugees in the U.S. came under Medicaid, for
                    the first two years. If there were any doubt, however, about the safety of
                    putting off the operation until after resettlement, we would authorize the
                    procedure in Europe.</p>
                <p>So that was what we were doing in Geneva. We were running our own Eastern
                    European refugee program and doing the political and liaison work, and the
                    information gathering from the international organizations in Geneva for the
                    U.S.G.'s Southeast Asian program. Since there were also larger numbers of
                    Africans refugees and displaced persons coming under the UNHCR care and
                    protection, we reported on that area. We would get the information, send it to
                    Washington, and Washington would make the decisions about how much money should
                    be given to the UNHCR, to IOM, or the Red Cross and for which purposes. Our
                    office at the time processed the U.S.G. payment checks for those
                    organizations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would your office be talking to refugees, or you were one
                        steremoved, making decisions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: We did not speak with many refugees in Europe. We visited Traiskirchen, a
                    refugee camp outside Vienna, and a camp in the Munich area. Yes, we observed
                    them, but we seldom talked to them about substantive issues. Doug and I sat in
                    on a few interviews and asked questions, but our job did not involve the
                    processing of individual refugees. We had the experience of refugee camp visits,
                    but our job was to concentrate on the big picture by talking with the heads of
                    the NGO units in Europe, UNHCR, IOM, and Red Cross officials, as well as State
                    Department officers in the countries of first asylum. We were on the phone
                    almost daily with Washington and followed up by sending cables.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>During my time in Geneva, refugees were a major preoccupation with Washington. It
                    was a significant domestic issue - not necessarily partisan, but an issue. Many
                    Americans were concerned, on both sides of the equation. Some people wanted to
                    limit the number of Southeast Asian refugees; others advocated a generous
                    admissions policy. State governors, as well as Congress and the White House were
                    united in their desire to bring more order into the process. The fall of Vietnam
                    and the easing of restrictions on travel in Eastern Europe meant that
                    unprecedented numbers of refugees were being admitted to the United States,
                    usually on an ad hoc basis (the parole authority of the Attorney General). The
                    process was disruptive. It was clear to many that Washington needed a new way to
                    handle the U.S.G. response to the worldwide refugee problem. The State
                    Department's Human Rights Bureau was proving not to be the place for the
                    responsibility of managing and funding the processing of refugees.</p>
                <p>There are some basic differences between human rights and refugees regarding
                    international organizations, NGOs, treaties and conventions, fora, and funding,
                    as well as domestic constituencies. Perhaps with different leadership at the
                    time in the Bureau of Human Rights, both aspects could have been accommodated.
                    The reality, however, was that refugee problems were given second priority by
                    Assistant Secretary Derian in favor of human rights issues. The dedicated
                    officials on the refugee side of that small Bureau overcame or worked around her
                    reluctance and performed magnificently in meeting the demands of the ongoing
                    crisis. Nevertheless, the Carter Administration and Congress decided that a new
                    bureaucratic structure was required to handle refugee issues. In 1980, Congress
                    passed the Refugee Act. This Act did many things. It codified which Department
                    was responsible for what. Roles were defined for the Department of Health and
                    Human Services (HHS), the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) of the
                    Department of Justice, and the Department of State. It created the equivalent of
                    a new Bureau in the Department of State, the Bureau of Refugee Programs, headed
                    by a Director. The first Director was John Baker, who lasted for a short time
                    before he went to another bureau. Congress decided not just to create a new
                    Bureau-like entity in the Department of State, it also created a structure above
                    the Bureau involving a Coordinator and a Deputy Coordinator with a dozen staff
                    positions. This structure soon proved to be unwieldy and almost unworkable. The
                    first Coordinator was Senator Dick Clark. His job description called for him to
                    coordinate with all the players, HHS, INS, State, Congress, the Governors, et
                    al. The Coordinator in theory was to be responsible directly to the President
                    and to take his orders from the White House. It possibly could have worked, but
                    in reality did not. Dick Clark soon after taking the job, resigned to become
                    involved in Senator Kennedy's bid for the Democratic nomination for
                    President.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>The next Coordinator and Deputy Coordinator were the two men, Victor Palmieri and
                    Frank Loy, who had worked on the reconstruction of the bankrupt New York Central
                    Railroad into Conrail. The idea was to bring a successful team from outside of
                    government and let them put a management structure into place to deal with
                    refugee problems. They made a good beginning. Then came the Mariel Cuban refugee
                    crisis. The President decided to run things out of the White House, and
                    marginalized Palmieri and Loy. President Carter became, in effect, the refugee
                    coordinator. With the election of Reagan as President, Palmieri and Loy
                    resigned. With the frequent changes at the top of the new refugee bureaucracy,
                    it should be no surprise that there was much confusion in the ranks regarding
                    priorities, assignments, and follow-through. We were trying to compensate for
                    Washington's disarray by including more specific recommendations in our
                    reporting. We thought that would make things simpler in the Refugee Program in
                    Washington. They would have the information we obtained, as well as a
                    recommendation on what to do as a result. We were also operating under a cloud
                    because the new team was not sure what they wanted Geneva to do or how it should
                    be structured. How much financial authority should we have? Should we continue
                    to run the Eastern European Program as before, or should it be revamped to place
                    it under Washington's control? In the near term, there was no alternative to
                    maintaining the status quo in Geneva since the new bureau was in no position to
                    take on any new tasks. We assumed from what we were hearing from Washington that
                    eventually Geneva would lose much of our current autonomy. There would likely be
                    a restructuring of the Eastern European Program. Instead of a centralized
                    control of the NGO operations in Geneva, the future shape of the Program was
                    toward working with fewer NGOs and allowing them autonomy within per-capita
                    limits to make their own decisions regarding expenditures.</p>
                <p>Q: I would think that in our dealings over the Vietnamese refugees, there had to
                    be an awful lot of sitting around the table, saying: “I'll take so many; how
                    many will you take?” and an awful lot of pushing and shoving.</p>
                <p>BUCHE: There certainly was. Once the refugees were approved for resettlement in
                    the U.S., there was a constant process of allocations and re-allocations with
                    all the players having a say. The Department had only a minor role in the
                    domestic allocation process. The big players were HHS, the NGOs, especially the
                    larger organizations (Church World Services, the U.S. Catholic Conference, HIAS,
                    and IRC), and representatives of the State governors. There was considerable
                    give and take over the numbers of refugees to be admitted. Before the Refugee
                    Act of 1980, this was an on-going, piecemeal exercise. With the passage of the
                    Act, there was a formal procedure put into place which involved the Congress and
                    the Executive Branch.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you involved personally in any of the refugee crises? I'm thinking
                    particularly of the Sudan, maybe Burundi and Rwanda, or any of those areas?</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>BUCHE: We were trying to do as much as we could through the UNHCR and the
                    International Committee of the Red Cross and through NGOs and not have to become
                    involved on the ground. There was one exception. After the passage of the
                    Refugee Act, there was a decision in Washington to begin processing of Ethiopian
                    refugees who were in the Sudan and Djibouti. In June 1980, I was sent to
                    Djibouti to set up a processing office. My orders were to select and process
                    several hundred refugees for interviews by officers from the Immigration and
                    Naturalization Service in early September so that they could arrive in the U.S.
                    before the end of our fiscal year on September 30.</p>
                <p>I certainly counted on the American Embassy and the UNHCR to assist me in this
                    undertaking. At first, they were really helpful in finding office space and
                    locally available persons to work with me. The UNHCR sent over its files on
                    refugees who had petitioned for overseas resettlement. Then as numerous minor
                    problems and bottlenecks arose, they became less willing to assist. The Charge
                    was unhappy with the crowds of refugees who gathered outside the processing
                    office. It was in the Motor Pool, but on the Embassy compound, so I was forced
                    to re-locate my office.</p>
                <p>When several Djibouti Government officials asked me for refugee status and
                    resettlement in the United States for their Djibouti-citizen relatives and I
                    turned them down immediately, they complained to the Charge. I explained that I
                    was managing a refugee program, not a migration or educational program. Only
                    refugees were eligible. By definition, a Djibouti citizen in his or her own
                    country could not be considered a refugee. The Djibouti Government was already
                    taking a “cut” of some 10-15% on food delivered to refugees by the UNHCR/WFP.
                    (The number of refugees in the two camps was pegged at a higher number than were
                    actually there. The “undistributed” food was taken by the Government and used
                    for its own purposes.) The Djibouti Government began to complain of the “burden”
                    of the refugees and how our program of resettlement would attract even larger
                    numbers of Ethiopians.</p>
                <p>Although Djibouti and Ethiopia adjoined, there was a desert of some 80-100 miles
                    to cross from the populated areas of Ethiopia before reaching the border.
                    Crossing the desert was extremely dangerous for the Ethiopian refugees. There
                    were Ethiopian military patrols as well as hostile natives looking for asylum
                    seekers on the way to Djibouti. Some refugees lost their lives from attacks;
                    some perished from exhaustion. Of those who reached Djibouti, almost all had
                    been robbed. Most of the women also suffered rapes. Life as a refugee in
                    Djibouti was extremely difficult. The weather was horrid, and there were
                    constant shake-downs and harassment by the police. The refugees were generally
                    aware of the dangers awaiting them in the desert and the daily tribulations of
                    life in Djibouti, but they fled to that country because they feared for their
                    very lives in Ethiopia. To say that Ethiopians would flee to Djibouti because a
                    few of them might have the chance to resettle in the U.S. was irrational.
                    Instead of trying to dissuade the Djibouti Government officials from this point
                    of view, the Charge seemed to agree. He became quite uncomfortable with the
                    program and did the minimum to help.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>There were three UNHCR officials posted to Djibouti when I arrived. Two of them
                    departed for annual leave in Europe shortly thereafter. The Chief of Mission, a
                    Kenyan, remained behind. He was unwilling to do much of anything to help. The
                    files turned over to me by the UNHCR were mostly out of date. In addition, there
                    had been few new files created in the year or so before my arrival for potential
                    resettlement cases. That meant I had to interview many refugees with nothing
                    more to go on than name, date of birth, and date of arrival in Djibouti.</p>
                <p>Since I was getting little cooperation from the American Charge, I asked him
                    repeatedly to speak to the Djibouti Government (and the French Embassy, since
                    the French controlled many aspects of the Government) for help in obtaining some
                    necessary papers for the refugees (birth and marriage certificates if those
                    events happened in Djibouti, plus exit permits from the country) as well as
                    medical exams. I could not understand why he was so unwilling to act, until I
                    went to the French DCM directly for help. I learned from the French DCM that the
                    UNHCR head and the Ethiopian Ambassador were “very close”. The DCM said he
                    suspected that the UNHCR head was passing on information about the refugees in
                    Djibouti to the Ethiopian Embassy. The French DCM turned out to be supportive,
                    and I was able to make some progress in obtaining papers from the Djibouti
                    Government offices. As far as the medical exams were concerned, all the French
                    physicians left the country in August for vacations in France, so I had to
                    appeal to Geneva. The Mission asked the International Organization for Migration
                    (IOM) for help. IOM sent down two doctors and a nurse, so the medical exams were
                    completed.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>The two locally-hired assistants proved to be gems. Both were wives of officials;
                    one from the American AID Mission and the other from the French Military
                    Assistance Group. I was reluctant for obvious reasons to use refugees to perform
                    any processing work. The temptations and pressures on refugees to “assist” their
                    friends and family would be too great to assure objectivity. I interviewed
                    without interpreters to prevent shading and coaching. By the time the
                    Immigration and Naturalization Service officer arrived in the first week of
                    September, we had 228 persons ready for interview. We had their medical
                    clearances, their security checks, and if applicable, the verification from the
                    American Red Cross of their stated relationships with
                    persons/companies/institutions in the USA. The latter step was not a
                    pre-requisite for being included in the U.S. resettlement program at the time,
                    but we were encouraged to obtain the data in order to facilitate integration in
                    the USA. All but one person was approved by the INS officer. The one exception
                    seemed to have very close ties in Djibouti and France, and could likely find
                    resettlement opportunities in either. I returned to Geneva after welcoming my
                    replacement and handing over the responsibility for starting the processing for
                    the next group. Eventually about a thousand Ethiopian refugees were resettled
                    out of Djibouti to the USA before the Djibouti Government closed the program in
                    1983. Sometimes we would become involved in individual cases, but through
                    letters, telegrams, or rarely, a phone call. It was the exception. I was
                    probably guilty more than anyone else because I knew many Ethiopians from my
                    tour in that country and they remembered, if not personally, at least my name
                    through some other people. You will recall that a revolution began in Ethiopia
                    in 1973 and that Emperor Haile Selassie was deposed and murdered a year later.
                    There were tens of thousands of Ethiopian refugees in Europe, the Middle East,
                    and Africa. Once in a while I would receive a letter from Djibouti, the Sudan,
                    or Somalia asking for assistance since their file seemed to be lost in the
                    bureaucracy. My normal reaction was to alert someone at the UNHCR headquarters
                    to the problem and then follow-up later to make sure the case was back on track.
                    Even before the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980, the U.S.G. could process and
                    admit Ethiopian refugees to the U.S. They were potential beneficiaries of the
                    old Refugee Act of 1952, which included a section designed to offer the Jews in
                    North Africa and the Middle East resettlement opportunities in the U.S. The
                    geographic limits for such assistance included Ethiopia, although the main
                    purpose at the time was for North African Jews.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Morocco?.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Particularly, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Egypt, yes?</hi>

                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>BUCHE: Yes, Egypt had the largest Jewish community in the area. Including
                    Ethiopia in the 1952 Act was one of those quirks of drafting, where the intent
                    was to help one particular ethnic or religious group under extreme pressure and
                    persecution, and for some reason, another group was also included. The Refugee
                    Act of 1980 did not include any geographic limitations, but defined a refugee in
                    accordance with the Refugee Convention of 1951.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1982 you went where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: I came to an end of my tour in Geneva in July 1982. I had received an
                    assignment several months earlier to be the DCM in Mogadishu. As Anike and I
                    were beginning to focus on Mogadishu, I got a call from a friend of mine, Nick
                    Platt, who said that he had been nominated as Ambassador to Zambia and would
                    like me to be his DCM. He was a Chinese specialist and had not served in Africa
                    before. I said I would be delighted to go to Lusaka as his DCM, but I had
                    already been assigned to Mogadishu. Nick knew about that and said he would work
                    it out with Ambassador Oakley for me to come to Lusaka and for Ambassador Oakley
                    to choose another DCM. Nick later reported that Bob Oakley had wanted another
                    officer for his DCM, but at the strong recommendation of the Executive Director
                    of the African Bureau, Len Shurtleff, he accepted me after checking out my
                    background and references. When Nick offered Oakley a chance to obtain his
                    preferred choice for DCM, he was delighted. So were Nick, Anike, and I. Looking
                    back, I am so pleased that I did not go to Mogadishu. From a professional point
                    of view, it probably would have been great assignment, but daily living was
                    awful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was very, very difficult.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Absolutely terrible, from every thing I heard or read. Mogadishu in the
                    early 1980s was dreadful, but I was a Foreign Service Officer and was prepared
                    to go wherever I was assigned. Besides, my professional “home” was the African
                    Bureau, and I had been out of my home area for seven years in Bonn and
                    Geneva.</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>We were leaving Geneva after four demanding, but rewarding and enjoyable years.
                    Our children, John and Christina, were happy in their school, Le College du
                    Leman, and had made good progress in their studies. They had many friends and
                    enjoyed the diverse activities offered by the school, particularly the
                    “obligatory” three weeks of skiing at the resort of Crans-Montana. In fact, John
                    and Christina liked the College so much that they wanted to stay as boarders in
                    the Internat, while we were in Africa. We agreed. We knew the owners of the
                    school and also had the assurance from the presence in the area of our dear
                    friends, Art and Doni Stillman, from our Ethiopian days. Their daughter,
                    Alexandra, was one year ahead of John in the same school. In addition, we knew
                    that the school in Lusaka was mediocre at best. Anike also liked living in
                    Geneva. For the first time since Ethiopia, she was able to work in a paying job.
                    She worked in the Mission Security Office with Arthur Hanrahan, mostly in a
                    liaison capacity with the Swiss Police. When I found some free time outside of
                    my long hours at work, I enjoyed singing with a well-respected Geneva group, le
                    Cercle Bach. One of the basic realities of the Foreign Service is that no
                    assignment is permanent. Anike and I were delighted with Geneva, but we knew we
                    would have to move on. Focusing our attention on Lusaka, we were relieved not to
                    be going to Mogadishu. We knew Zambia from our previous assignment to
                    neighboring Malawi. I knew that from a professional point of view, being in
                    Lusaka in 1982, was the place to be. Big changes were taking place in Southern
                    Africa - Namibia, South Africa itself, Angola, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were a “front-line” country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Zambia was a front-line country. What this meant in 1982, was not so much
                    a threat of a direct attack against Zambia, but rather that Zambia was in an
                    area where there was so much insecurity and fighting that the country was the
                    victim of cross-border fighting between outside parties. Also the insecurity had
                    negative results for Zambia's economy. President Kaunda sought to bring an end
                    to the fighting and offered Zambia as a venue for discussions between or among
                    the warring parties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1982 to 1984. How did Nick Platt work
                        aambassador? What was his way of operating?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Nick was an excellent manager, and he had wide experience in Asia and in
                    the Department. He came to Lusaka, having read voraciously everything he could
                    about the history of the country as well as the post's reporting over the past
                    several years. He spent considerable time with his predecessor, Frank Wisner.
                    Frank was then serving as the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary (PDAS) in the
                    Bureau of African Affairs. They were close personal friends, and I think that
                    Frank had something to do with Nick's being nominated to Lusaka. I think Nick
                    was probably looking forward to an ambassadorship in Asia, but there was nothing
                    open at the time. Zambia was an important country for our overall interests and
                    Nick accepted the position.</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>Nick's style was to let the professionals who knew the area keep him informed or
                    make recommendations to him. If he was satisfied with what they were doing, he
                    let them carry out their tasks without trying to micromanage. Frank Wisner had
                    pulled together a competent group of professionals. As is often the case in the
                    Foreign Service, the new Ambassador comes into a situation where his or her
                    staff had been chosen by the predecessor. I was the only person chosen by Nick.
                    He knew me from past experiences. We had served in Canada together, at different
                    posts, but at the same time. I saw him several times in Geneva. He was the PDAS
                    or the Acting Assistant Secretary with IO (Bureau of International
                    Organizations).</p>
                <p>We worked well together. Both of us had multilateral diplomatic experience. I had
                    African experience and contacts in AF; Nick had Asian experience and contacts
                    throughout the Department, as well as in the DOD and CIA. What was happening in
                    Zambia from a bilateral point was not that important strategically to the U.S.
                    Things politically were on an even keel, while economically, the country drifted
                    downward. We had an economic assistance program with an AID Mission. What made
                    Zambia important was its “front-line” status, and Kaunda's policy of seeking
                    solutions to the regional conflicts. There were numerous attempts by Kaunda
                    through emissaries and conferences to bring about peace.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was during the time of “Constructive
                        Engagement”?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>BUCHE: “Constructive Engagement” was the name applied to the policy of Assistant
                    Secretary for African Affairs Chester Crocker toward South Africa. He contended
                    that the USG and others were not getting very far with South Africa by
                    castigating and isolating the leaders or by publicly criticizing the cruelty and
                    inhumanity of apartheid. He maintained that we would be more successful if we
                    made our opposition to apartheid quite clear, but that we also try to find ways
                    of working with the South African Government to improve the domestic situation
                    for the blacks. The policy of speaking constructively with the South African
                    Government also applied to its conduct with its neighbors, particularly in
                    Namibia and Angola where there was active fighting. The Reagan Administration
                    came under very heavy criticism for this policy. Apartheid was so repugnant to
                    the American people that the idea of our Government's trying to work
                    constructively with the South African Government, the enforcer of the policy,
                    appeared wrong. As we know, when President Reagan vetoed legislation to embargo
                    U.S. trade with South Africa, the Congress over-road his refusal (with heavy
                    Republican Party support). I have not served in South Africa, so my judgment
                    about the effect of Constructive Engagement in advancing or retarding the
                    eventual overthrow of apartheid is based on second-hand sources. I concluded
                    that apartheid was becoming so costly and difficult to maintain in the face of
                    embargos and the increasingly effective internal opposition from armed
                    resistance groups, that it was only a matter of time before the system
                    collapsed. I thought that CE would probably prolong the time before the
                    collapse, since the South African Government could count on the U.S.G. (if not
                    the American people) not to help its opponents. We had so many discussions
                    within the Embassy and with outsiders about the pro's and con's of CE. Within,
                    we could openly debate the subject; with others, we stuck to the official
                    line.</p>
                <p>From an external point of view, Constructive Engagement was a positive. We and
                    others could talk to South Africans about Southwest Africa (Namibia), Angola,
                    and Mozambique. It was helpful that we could bring the South Africans to the
                    table to try to find some solutions for the conflicts in the region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk about the states in the region. What role
                        were you playing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: We were playing a facilitative role so that when the Angolan Government or
                    the SWAPO (Southwest African People's Organization, the nationalist group
                    seeking independence) and the South Africans wanted to meet or were strongly
                    encouraged to meet, the U.S. Embassy and the Zambian Government were the hosts
                    for the occasion. This fitted in with President Kaunda's peacemaking vision, and
                    also with our ideas and policy. We jointly hosted about six or seven meetings
                    with various participants. The invitations went out from the United States
                    Government and from the Zambian Government for the Angolans and the South
                    Africans to meet, for the Malawians and the Mozambicans to meet, or for South
                    Africa to meet with SWAPO.</p>

                <p>SWAPO had its political headquarters outside of Lusaka. The actual military
                    headquarters and the training camps were distant. Some were within Zambia, but
                    more were inside of Angola. The fighting took place mostly along the border
                    between Southwest Africa and Angola. The fighting was mostly SWAPO against South
                    Africa, but occasionally, UNITA fighters under Jonas Savimbi would team up with
                    their supporters, the South Africans to attack SWAPO. The SWAPO officials near
                    Lusaka were the political leaders. They made up the delegations for the talks
                    with the South Africans.</p>
                <p>The situation in Angola was much more complex. In that mixture were the Angolan
                    Government forces and their Cuban allies against the UNITA forces and their
                    supporters the South Africans. The Soviets supplied arms and advice to the
                    Angolan Government and the Cubans. It was an on-going war involving many
                    parties, with clashes occurring throughout the country. Almost as a sideshow,
                    there was the aftermath of the Zimbabwe or the Southern Rhodesian struggle for
                    independence. That had already been settled, but there were still hard feelings
                    and scores to be settled between the two armed independence movements (basically
                    divided on tribal lines). Zambia had supported the losing faction (Joshua Nkomo)
                    in the struggle for independence. Nkomo lost heavily during the fighting for
                    independence and afterwards in the clashes with the victorious forces under
                    Robert Mugabe. Zambia in 1982 was still engaged in a campaign of “let's make up
                    and be friends” with Mugabe.</p>
                <p>While the U.S.G. participation in the conferences was coordinated by Washington,
                    the Embassy had the task of working with the Zambian Government on substance and
                    logistics. If U.S.G. and Zambian positions or goals in respect to the other
                    parties were too far apart, we had the task of negotiating a closer convergence
                    of views. Several days before the start of the conference, a contingent would
                    arrive from Washington to participate in the meetings. Chet Crocker led the U.S.
                    Delegation several times; Frank Wisner on one occasion; and Ambassador Platt on
                    several occasions. Embassy staff often served as note-takers for the
                    meetings.</p>

                <p>BUCHE: We saw the Zambian Government as entrenched and determined to maintain its
                    one-party monopoly. The Party of Kaunda (the United National Independence Party,
                    UNIP) controlled the levers of power and thus could do practically whatever it
                    wanted. This meant jobs, housing, cars, access to “loans”, international travel,
                    and numerous other means for UNIP officials and UNIP-supporters in Government to
                    enrich themselves, family, and friends. There was previously an opposition
                    party, but it was gradually suppressed. Some of the leaders spent time in
                    prison, but they survived. (Unlike the fate of many of the political prisoners
                    in adjacent Malawi under Banda!) There was an uneasy peace in the country, but
                    there was very little political violence. (There was an increasing level of
                    break-ins, thefts, and robberies in the major cities during our posting there.
                    The deteriorating economic conditions were blamed for the rise in crime.) Kaunda
                    was more interested in Zambia's external affairs than in the nitty-gritty of
                    domestic politics. We had the feeling that domestically things were drifting.
                    Copper prices had collapsed after a decade of high demand. Much of the gains
                    from the high copper prices were squandered or stolen. Food production was not
                    keeping up with population growth. There was a recession. Corruption was
                    commonplace. Zambian officials were often absent from their office or duty
                    station. They were engaged in family ceremonies (marriages, baptisms, funerals,
                    commemorations, etc.) or moonlighting in a second job. Public services were
                    often not being performed effectively or at all, whether in the fields of
                    health, education, telecommunications, public works, public security, or
                    agriculture. The infrastructure was slowly crumbling. The leaders of the country
                    seemed to make no effort to rein in the absenteeism, neglect, and theft of
                    supplies. If you wanted medicine, you paid for medicine, although it was
                    supposed to be free. This was something that Kaunda had promised in his first
                    election campaign. It was an extravagantly expensive proposition to promise free
                    medical care for the entire country. You could imagine what that would cost if
                    it were truly carried out. Actually, it was a statement that did not have any
                    meaning, because there were not enough doctors, nurses, or technicians, clinics,
                    medicines, or beds to serve a small fraction of the population. Many countries
                    would donate medical equipment to the Ministry of Health, but once they were in
                    need of repair or recalibration, they had to be abandoned, since there were few
                    technicians in the country. There was a large general hospital in Lusaka that
                    was understaffed or overstaffed, depending on what the department was. People
                    would come from all over the country trying to get medical treatment there. It
                    was a financial and medical albatross, an enormously costly set of buildings
                    that failed in most instances to deliver adequate treatment. We were told by the
                    regional medical officer: Do not use that hospital for any serious illness or
                    accident. If the Embassy nurse or contract doctor cannot treat you, we will
                    evacuate you to Europe, to South Africa, or to Zimbabwe. There were several
                    missionary hospitals in the vicinity of Lusaka, where we could go for minor
                    things. For something serious, we would fly out of the country.</p>

                <p>Kaunda had decided that Zambia would maintain an economic embargo against South
                    Africa in protest against apartheid. While such a policy was morally uplifting,
                    it had a terrible effect on Zambia's economy. In so many areas, South Africa had
                    been Zambia's leading trading partner. South Africa manufactured most of the
                    machinery for the mining industry and for much of the other industries in
                    Zambia. Spare parts had to be obtained by circuitous routes to avoid “breaking”
                    the embargo. For example, the mines would buy spare parts from Zaire or Gabon
                    that had been manufactured in South Africa, shipped to those countries,
                    re-labeled, and then shipped to Zambia. The extra shipping and handling costs
                    doubled the price. It was both a ridiculous and dishonest policy. President
                    Kaunda would say, “It hurts us, but we are not going to trade with South Africa.
                    No trade whatsoever with South Africa until they change their policy of
                    apartheid.” But there was trade. It was all done in a convoluted and
                    hypocritical manner. I pointed this out many times to my Zambian friends. They
                    knew the score and would only shrug their shoulders and roll their eyes. Vice
                    President Bush visited Zambia in 1982. When we were invited to State House for
                    the official dinner, it was an elegant affair. Starched white linen with
                    candlelight and beautiful silverware! And the wines? All South African wines,
                    but the servers took the labels off. The menu stated “cabernet sauvignon” or
                    “merlot” with the vintage. I asked one of the waiters whether the wines were
                    from South Africa. He smiled and nodded affirmatively. He then brought me the
                    cork. It read Stellenbosch; it was South African. It was similar to what I would
                    find in a local grocery store. The wines would be labeled “Democratic Republic
                    of Zaire” or “Republic of Gabon.” The corks told the truth - South Africa!</p>
                <p>Kaunda was determined to ship Zambian copper to its worldwide buyers using the
                    Tan-Zam Railroad instead of using the rail links through Zimbabwe and South
                    Africa. He did this because of his determination to maintain a boycott against
                    South Africa (although he was also denying another “Front-Line State and ally,
                    Zimbabwe, potential revenue from the transshipments. The Tan-Zam Railroad was
                    built by the Chinese as a spectacular gesture to gain a political/economic
                    foothold in East and Southern Africa. The RR turned out to be a high-cost
                    operation, although the Chinese paid for most of the construction and the
                    original rolling stock. What caused the original estimates for operations to go
                    up was the unanticipated high costs of maintenance for the line, as well as the
                    locomotives and railcars. The project was put together too quickly, and there
                    were numerous instances of faulty engineering. The Chinese did not have
                    experience in working with African soils, and so there were problems in drainage
                    and soil expansion and contraction. There were also faulty assumptions on the
                    ability of the locals to maintain the right of way and the rolling stock.
                    Additionally, the Chinese greatly underestimated the number of accidents, which
                    would occur because of negligence, drunkenness, or sheer ignorance. The net
                    result was that shipping rates had to be increased. Also there were so many
                    breakdowns of rolling stock, derailments, and delays for track repairs that
                    shipments were inevitably late in arriving at the port of Dar Es Salaam. The
                    port itself was often blocked because the freighter ships would have to await
                    the arrival of the delayed trains. Similar problems existed in shipping heavy
                    machinery to the Zambian mines. Much of the machinery was manufactured in South
                    Africa, but was shipped to third countries before being off-loaded at Dar Es
                    Salaam.</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>It was clear to any impartial observer that Zambia's economy was slowly falling
                    apart. The domestic political situation was also deteriorating. We were
                    reporting to Washington that an economic collapse was not imminent, but was only
                    a few years away unless fundamental changes were made. We also did not believe
                    Kaunda would be capable of instituting the changes or of maintaining the
                    discipline needed to implement them, if they were imposed from outside by the
                    World Bank or the International Monetary Fund.</p>
                <p>Washington's chief interest in Kaunda was his external role in South African
                    geopolitics. He was very active on several fronts and had enough clout and
                    respect to influence policies and events. Washington had reservations about some
                    of his actions in the Southern African context, but on the whole, regarded him
                    positively. Kaunda often rankled Washington with his sharp criticism of the
                    Reagan Administration's policy toward South Africa. Nevertheless, even on South
                    Africa, Kaunda was regarded as a potentially helpful interlocutor. On Angola and
                    Namibia he was a crucial partner for us. Washington was keenly interested in
                    knowing about the internal threats to Kaunda, namely what were the chances of a
                    successful coup d'etat against him. This was a constant worry in Africa. The
                    local CIA station focused on the coup possibilities, both from its own sources,
                    as well as from an official liaison with the Zambian intelligence agencies. The
                    unwavering evaluation submitted to Washington was that Kaunda was in little
                    danger of being deposed in a coup. The Embassy reported on the broader domestic
                    political scene. Our judgment was that internal political instability would
                    worsen, in large part because of the failing economy, but that for the next
                    several years, Kaunda would most probably remain in power. Washington was
                    basically of the same opinion about Kaunda's staying power and potential
                    helpfulness, and included him as an important player in the calculus about our
                    policy designs in Southern Africa. In the 1980s, Zambia was quite important to
                    the United States for its geopolitical position.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>BUCHE: Well, my observations of Tanzania were a continuation of the way I looked
                    at the Tanzanian Government when I was in Malawi from 1970-1972. I saw that it
                    was the recipient of an enormous amount of foreign aid that was not doing very
                    much to develop the country. When I saw Tanzania from the optic of Zambia, which
                    had close relations with Tanzania, I did not change my opinion. Tanzania was a
                    favored country of the Scandinavians, the Dutch, and to some extent, the US. The
                    President, Julius Nyerere, was a reasonable leader. He had been freely elected
                    and ran the country with some regard for human rights. Nyerere was clever at
                    contrasting his government with the surrounding dictatorships. He was a disaster
                    as a manager and administrator, but his charm and earnestness strengthened the
                    belief by the big donors that he was personally honest and did not benefit
                    personally from the corruption around him. He did live relatively modestly as a
                    President. His weakness was that he tolerated dishonesty in his officials. Some
                    donors rationalized or made excuses when they should have taken a firm line when
                    audits showed missing cash and assets from foreign aid projects. The donors
                    usually were willing to continue the projects while awaiting to see what the
                    President would do about his cabinet ministers and other high-ranking officials
                    suspected of stealing funds. Nyerere pleaded for patience and magnanimity
                    towards his officials, promising that they would be disciplined. Some did lose
                    their government jobs, but they had stolen enough to set themselves up in
                    private business. Theft and malfeasance were probably not the main cause for the
                    high level of failure of most of the assistance projects. Many were badly
                    designed and others were carried out poorly. It took years before the supporters
                    and champions of Nyerere and socialist Tanzania finally recognized what was so
                    apparent to objective observers on the ground. I had a macro view from Malawi
                    and Zambia what was happening in Tanzania through Embassy reporting from Dar Es
                    Salaam, UN and World Bank reports, plus discussions with Europeans and Americans
                    who were involved in the field in Tanzania.</p>
                <p>What Ambassador Platt and I learned from the Chinese Ambassador in Zambia about
                    the Chinese assistance program in Tanzania was astounding. For political
                    purposes, the Chinese were willing to tolerate much higher levels of theft,
                    mismanagement, and incompetence than the Europeans and Americans. How Nick and I
                    developed close relations with the Chinese to be told such confidential
                    information is a fascinating vignette. We had good and friendly relations with
                    the Chinese Embassy in Zambia, but we were not particularly close and did not
                    discuss sensitive subjects. The Chinese had by far the largest embassy in
                    Lusaka. They also had an enormous aid program. They were very interested in what
                    the Soviets were doing in country as well as in the entire region. The Chinese
                    thought that the CIA had some penetrating insights on what the Soviets were
                    doing. This was a period of increased Soviet-Chinese tensions and suspicions.
                    The Soviets were not that very active in Zambia, as far as we could determine.
                    They wereactive, however in Tanzania, Angola, and Zimbabwe. The Chinese had a
                    fixation on the Soviets. They were eager to learn as much as they could about
                    their rival Communist power. There were discussions in Beijing and Washington
                    about the proposal for an informal exchange of information on matters of mutual
                    interest to our two governments. Washington agreed to allow Ambassador Platt to
                    conduct an exchange of intelligence information on the Soviets with the
                    Chinese.</p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>The Chinese Ambassador was a very senior African hand. He had come to Lusaka
                    after serving four or five years as Ambassador in Tanzania. Given Ambassador
                    Platt's Chinese connections, it was clear that Lusaka was an ideal place for
                    such an exchange to be tried. The ground-rules were simple. Each side would
                    consist of Ambassador, DCM, and their spouses. We would meet for dinner on a
                    monthly basis, alternating between the residences of the American and the
                    Chinese Ambassadors. We received our instructions from Washington a day before
                    the dinner. We were told what we could pass on to the Chinese and were given
                    some questions to ask the Chinese. We tried to maintain an air of informality in
                    the exchange by mixing social chitchat with confidential information. The meals
                    at our residence were typically “American” at the request of the Chinese. We had
                    fried chicken, hamburgers, barbequed spareribs, hot dogs, potato salad, and
                    other American classics. The Chinese really seemed to appreciate what Sheila
                    Platt served.</p>
                <p>When we ate at the Chinese residence, it was quite a treat. I believe each time
                    we must have had thirteen courses of fabulous food, plus many rounds of a potent
                    Chinese drink. It was quite open and informal. By the end of the meal, we had
                    mentioned to them everything that was in our briefing paper about what
                    Washington wanted the Chinese to know about the Soviets in Southern Africa. The
                    Chinese DCM wrote it all down on little cards as he was eating or drinking. When
                    the Chinese Ambassador spoke about the Soviets, I would jot down key words. The
                    Chinese told us very little that we did not already know about the Soviets. His
                    comments, however, about the trials and tribulations of running a large economic
                    assistance program for Tanzania and Zambia were detailed and fascinating. He
                    confirmed with his stories and examples what we had picked up from various other
                    diplomatic and expatriate observers.</p>
                <p>Although we were interested in what he had to say, at times we were almost
                    overwhelmed by the number of stories chronicling the wrong-doing and
                    incompetence of some of the local officials and employees of the railroad. I
                    came to the realization that Nick and I provided a therapeutic occasion for the
                    Ambassador to get rid of some of his accumulated frustrations by sharing his
                    problems with us. What did it all mean that such and such a district official
                    was stealing money or that he was going out with someone else's wife, or that he
                    drank excessively? I would jot down the information. What did we do with the
                    information? The following day, we would go over it with our local CIA station
                    chief, as well as with the political counselor, in case they were interested.
                    They seldom were, so we filed it in the safe that held our Embassy biographic
                    files.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This often happens. Zaire - did that raise any

                <p>BUCHE: There were bad feelings in Zambia against Zaire. What really irked the
                    Zambians was that the conduct of Zaireans in Zambia. Bands of soldiers or armed
                    civilians would cross the border and do all sorts of nasty things in Zambia.
                    This would involve stealing cars, burglarizing homes and shops, getting drunk,
                    or going on a shooting rampage. The bands would return to Zaire with impunity.
                    Seldom were the individuals arrested or disciplined. If a stolen car were
                    identified, seldom would the rightful owner get it back. It was often like the
                    era of the Wild West along the border. Kaunda and other Zambian official
                    believed that Mobutu was uninterested in taking steps to prevent such
                    cross-border thuggery. It was widely known that Kaunda did not like or trust
                    Mobutu.</p>
                <p>Q: I think we've pretty well covered Zambia, the peace process, the contacts with
                    the neighbors and all, and so why don't we move to 1984, when you came back to
                    Washington to the Bureau of Refugee Affairs?</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>It is the 18th of February, 2000. John, 1984 you were with thBureau for Refugee
                    Affairs?</p>
                <p>BUCHE: It was called the Bureau for Refugee Programs. It was known by its
                    abbreviation of RP. RP was a Bureau, but it had a Director and not an Assistant
                    Secretary as its head. (The Director, however, received the equivalent salary of
                    an Assistant Secretary.) It was one of these bureaucratic nuances that meant
                    something within the organization, but had little meaning outside. Over the
                    Bureau was the Refugee Coordinator (S/R). The Coordinator had the rank of an
                    Under Secretary. The Refugee Act of 1980 set up the formal structure.
                    Previously, the Bureau for Human Rights (established during the Carter
                    Administration) was responsible for refugee affairs. Under the Clinton
                    Administration, there was a reorganization of the refugee structure within the
                    State Department. RP became the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration
                    (PRM) with an Assistant Secretary. The position of Refugee Coordinator was
                    abolished. A new position was established, the Under Secretary for Global
                    Affairs (G). PRM and three other Bureaus reported to G.</p>

                <p>Q: Let's talk about this bureaucratic entity. When you came there - -and then
                    we'll talk about what you were doing - what were its responsibilities?BUCHE: It
                    was set up in response to needs that reached crisis proportions after the fall
                    of Saigon and the massive outflow of refugees from Southeast Asia (the “Boat
                    People”). The Department, the White House, the Congress, and especially the
                    non-governmental organizations, the NGOs, realized by 1976 that a new structure
                    was needed in the Department of State to deal effectively with the worldwide
                    refugee crisis. The small office that already existed in the Department had been
                    set up in the 1950s to focus largely upon Eastern European refugees. The refugee
                    crises of the mid-1970s were worldwide, involving African, Middle Eastern, Latin
                    American, Eastern European, Soviet, and Southeast Asian refugees. Within the
                    Department of State, the geographic bureaus were trying to handle the refugee
                    problems in their regions. The Department of Justice and the Department of
                    Health and Human Services were also trying to cope with inadequate bureaucratic
                    structures, mandates, and funding. It was possible for a while, but eventually
                    the sheer numbers of refugees began to overwhelm the government bureaucracy.
                    Congress in 1980 passed the Refugee Act, which set up the Office of the Refugee
                    Coordinator and a Bureau of Refugee Programs. In 1984, the Refugee Coordinator
                    was Jonathan Moore. He was associated with the Kennedies. I had heard that
                    Senator Kennedy lobbied hard in favor of Jonathan's appointment by President
                    Reagan. What I came back to was a Bureau that was beginning to function
                    effectively. RP had a Director, Jim Purcell, and three Deputy Assistant
                    Secretaries (DASs). There were offices to perform the following functions:
                    accounting and finance; emergency response; resettlement, training and
                    monitoring; plus geographic offices. RP was unlike other bureaus in State
                    because of the nature of its work and the fact that it handled big sums of
                    program money. At the time, it was around eight hundred million dollars, which
                    meant that there had to be auditors and accountants. Congress determined that
                    the budget for RP would be separate from the State Department's or that of the
                    Agency for International Development (AID). The separate budget was a big plus
                    for RP. There were frequent fights between the Administration and Congress on
                    issues that sometimes led to cutting of programs or pressures to do this or
                    that. Since RP had its own budget, it was isolated from these maneuvers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So if there was going to be a cut in the budget, it had to
                        be essentially done by Congress rather than the Department of State saying,
                        everybody takes a 10 percent cut.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>BUCHE: The level of RP's budget was ultimately in the hands of Congress, not the
                    Department of State. How RP's budget level was determined was, of course,
                    through an initial proposal from the Administration (through the Office of
                    Management and Budget, OMB) and a series of formal and informal consultations
                    between the Judiciary Committee Chairmen (and the Minority Heads), the Secretary
                    of State, and the Attorney General (or designated representatives.) Among the
                    most important items to determine was the number of refugees to be admitted into
                    the U.S. for the following fiscal year. The consultation practice was written
                    into the 1980 Refugee Law. There was heavy consultation among the staffs in
                    setting the numbers of refugees and the overall amounts of dollars. The
                    consultations were held throughout the year, and involved State, HHS, Justice
                    (INS), the NSC, the NGOs, and the various Congressional staffers. By the time
                    the actual formal consultations took place, refugee numbers and dollar amounts
                    had already been worked out. I recall that Senator Kennedy and his staff were
                    active participants. The Senator was Chairman of the Sub-Committee, which had
                    oversight for refugee admissions and other refugee-related issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Senator Edward Kennedy, from Massachusetts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Yes, his staff members very often would talk to us, and the Senator
                    himself would phone the Director. They would go over some problems and
                    unresolved issues. There was also interest in the House. Both the Senate and the
                    House were really interested in refugee issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the director when you started?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: It was Jim Purcell. He was there my entire three years. He had come from
                    OMB to RP as the DAS responsible for budgets and finances. He was made Director
                    about a year before I arrived. One of the main reasons he was brought in
                    originally was to put a system into place to manage the millions of dollars the
                    Bureau was giving to international organizations and NGOs to provide care,
                    maintenance, protection, and transport for refugees. When RP was created, there
                    was only a rudimentary system in place to manage the disbursement and tracking
                    of large sums of money to numerous organizations. There were a dozen officers
                    who were deeply concerned about refugees and who proposed or took actions to
                    help them. Sometimes their actions were not properly coordinated or cost more
                    than was anticipated. Program officers were shoveling so much money out the door
                    for refugee emergencies all over Southeast Asia that they nearly overspent the
                    budget. It was nearly impossible to keep an accurate count of how much money had
                    been obligated. This eventually led to some serious problems, not only with our
                    auditors, but with Congress. There was a desperate need for someone to bring
                    financial discipline into the process. Jim Purcell brought a financial
                    management background to the Bureau. He did such an outstanding job as the DAS
                    for financial management that he was promoted to head RP.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What piece of the action did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: I was one of the few officers who had some refugee experience before
                    coming into the Bureau. I had been in the Refugee Section at our Mission at
                    Geneva. I also had experience in Europe with refugees. I was put in charge of an
                    office that embraced the Western Hemisphere, the Middle East, and Eastern
                    Europe/Soviet Union. The other geographic offices were Africa and Asia. The
                    refugee programs for Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union were running very well
                    because of the Geneva Mission. The Mission had years of experience in the area,
                    so I did not have to devote much time in Washington to this area. I knew the
                    strengths of the Mission, and so deferred to their judgments and
                    recommendations. The Middle Eastern part of my portfolio was problematic.
                    Fortunately, my deputy, Judy Chavchavadze, knew the issues quite well and had
                    excellent contacts to turn to when necessary. The organization with which we
                    dealt on refugee problems in the Middle East was not the UNHCR, but UNRWA -
                    United Nations Relief and Works Administration. The organization had
                    responsibilities for caring for the Palestinian refugees.</p>
                <p>This was an organization that was traditionally underfunded. We and the European
                    countries, plus Japan, Australia, and Canada basically supported the
                    organization. Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Egypt provided land for UNRWA to set
                    up camps for the Palestinians. UNRWA contributed funds for the education and
                    health care contributed by the four host states. The other Arab states did not
                    do very much to assist UNRWA financially. We would ask Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and
                    some of the other wealthy Arab states to contribute more toward UNRWA, but they
                    seldom responded by more than a token amount.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Well, many explanations. The Saudis said that they had no responsibility
                    for Palestinian refugees. The answer was for the Israelis to allow the refugees
                    to return home. The Saudis contended that money given to UNRWA, which was
                    feeding, educating, housing, and providing medical services to the refugees
                    outside of Israel, was just taking the pressure off of Israel to allow the
                    refugees to return. Those attitudes were generally shared by the other Arab
                    governments. To keep some of the camps from having to close or school kids being
                    sent home early because there was no more money, we and the usual donors would
                    usually come up with the extra five or seven million dollars. The countries that
                    hosted the Palestinians said that they were not going to contribute extra cash
                    to UNRWA because they were already out of pocket from providing educational and
                    health facilities to the refugees. They did have some un-reimbursed expenses,
                    but UNRWA covered most of the costs of the Palestinians in the camps. In
                    addition to funding shortages, there were other problems. I spent much time
                    writing talking points for our embassies to use with the host governments on
                    funding issues or other problems having to do with UNRWA. That task became
                    almost routine.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure it did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Judy and I worked closely with the Near Eastern Bureau, NEA,on UNRWA and
                    Palestinian refugee issues.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find the NEA people would cringe and try to avoid you in the halls
                    when you came around and asked their governments for money for UNRWA?</p>
                <p>BUCHE: Well, they would say, “You're not going to get any money from our
                    governments, but we'll sign off on your cable if you're going to ask for help
                    from Western Europe. We would be delighted if you would ask them.” If I said I
                    would like for our Ambassador to approach the Saudis, they would sign off, but
                    with the rejoinder that a demarche to the Saudis at the mere ambassadorial level
                    was not going to work. Sometimes NEA would alert me to the travel of the
                    Secretary or Deputy Secretary in the area and ask for talking points to include
                    in his briefing book. They were realistic and helpful, since they wanted peace
                    in the camps.</p>
                <p>We often had to speak with Congress about funding for UNRWA. The general feeling
                    on the Hill about UNRWA was negative. The USG was paying about a quarter of the
                    costs. The situation of the Palestinian refugees looked intractable. It seemed
                    that we would be required to fund the situation far, far into the future. Also
                    Congress was not sure how the Israelis felt about UNRWA, but the lawmakers
                    certainly knew how the Palestinians felt about Israel. The net result was that
                    we had a difficult time convincing Congress to appropriate enough funds for
                    UNRWA. Congress was generous in funding assistance to refugees elsewhere in the
                    world, but often balked at providing money for the Palestinians. I recall one
                    instance when the Senate Appropriations Committee voted to cut back by a
                    significant amount the Administration's request for UNRWA. The Secretary of
                    State went to the Committee and appealed for the full amount, but was
                    unsuccessful in changing the decision. We were really desperate, since we knew
                    that our shortfall in funding UNRWA would produce a ripple effect on other
                    donors, and they, too, would cut back. UNRWA would have to retrench
                    dramatically. The Israeli Prime Minister was visiting Washington at the time.
                    When the NEA Assistant Secretary met with him, he asked the Israeli Prime
                    Minister to indicate to Congress that Israel supported the restoration of the
                    funding cut. The Israeli Prime Minister agreed to do so since the last thing the
                    Israelis wanted was more unrest in the refugee camps. He told the Assistant
                    Secretary he would have a few words with his friends. He was true to his word
                    and within days, word came back to the Department that the funding would be
                    restored. What the Secretary, the NEA Assistant Secretary, and RP's Jim Purcell
                    had failed to achieve, the Israeli PM succeeded with a few words to “his
                    friends”! I realized then the extent of the power in Congress of the “Jewish
                    lobby”.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when, about 1985?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>BUCHE: 1985. We learned from the experience. We decided to work more closely with
                    the Israeli Embassy on UNRWA funding issues with Congress. We shared with them
                    our budget requests and counted on them to pass the word to their friends in
                    Congress that Israel looked favorably on USG financial support for UNRWA. We had
                    no more trouble from Congress about UNRWA funding cuts while I was with RP
                    (through 1987).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What other things were you dealing with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: I have spoken about two of the three parts of my portfolio, Eastern
                    Europe/Soviet Union and the Middle East. The Latin American portfolio was the
                    real problem area for me. I spent almost 60 percent of my time on the Latin
                    American side. I should be more specific - Central America. It was during the
                    Reagan Presidency, so we were in the era of the Contras and Ollie North. It was
                    also the time of the Salvadoran civil war, the fighting in Guatemala, and the
                    upheavals in Haiti. There were refugee flows in all directions. The wars and the
                    refugees had a heavy impact on the American public and our foreign policy. There
                    were ongoing debates in Congress and in the media about the ways refugees were
                    being cared for and protected, as well as which national or ideological groups
                    were recognized by the US as refugees eligible for resettlement. How the USG
                    regarded refugee groups was influenced by both political and humanitarian
                    considerations. The Department's Bureau of American Republics (ARA) under
                    Assistant Secretary Elliot Abrams was the focal point for the Administration's
                    Central American strategy. ARA made distinctions about the ideologies of the
                    refugees and thus favored some and were critical of others. Accordingly, ARA was
                    ambivalent about the non-ideological, neutral approach of the UNHCR, the ICRC,
                    and some of the NGOs toward the refugees. RP and ARA were frequently at
                    logger-heads. Congress was more inclined to support RP's approach, while the
                    White House backed ARA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, ARA as an institution had not really been dealing
                        witrefugees before, had it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: No, at least not as a key aspect of our foreign policy. Thus many of the
                    officials in ARA viewed refugees through the political optic. They were quite
                    concerned about the Salvadoran refugees who were fleeing their country's civil
                    war to seek asylum in Costa Rica and Honduras. ARA looked upon these groups with
                    suspicion, since they were sympathetic to the rebels. ARA feared that the
                    Salvadoran refugee camps in the area of Colomocagua just inside Honduras were
                    serving as rest and recuperation areas for the guerrillas fighting the
                    USG-backed Salvadoran forces.</p>
                <p>Q: You're talking about rebels going to the refugee camps, recuperating, and then
                    going back and doing the fighting, which happened in Cambodia - well, it happens
                    all over the world.</p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>BUCHE: That was the accusation. The High Commissioner for Refugees, which had
                    inherited de facto camps just over the border from Salvador in Honduras wanted
                    to move these camps deeper into Honduras in conformity with policy of moving
                    refugees away from contentious borders. The refugees would be safer because
                    there was hot pursuit at times by the Salvadoran army into the refugee camps and
                    shoot-outs. At other times there were clear cases of rebels getting first aid,
                    food, and rest in the camps. The High Commissioner approached us and asked that
                    the US Government lean on the Honduran Government to make land available and for
                    us to contribute to building the new camps. ARA supported this proposal.
                    Honduras offered some land, but it was not at all suitable for refugee camps. So
                    instead of going back to the Honduran Government and asking for more suitable
                    land, ARA returned to the complaining mode, blaming the UNHCR for not moving the
                    camps and for not controlling access better.</p>
                <p>A consultant to RP, Bob Gersony, completed a field study of the Colomocagua camps
                    several months after the first offer of land, and confirmed what we had
                    expected: the Salvadoran rebels were indeed using the camps for R and R. On the
                    basis of Gersony's report and other intelligence sources, ARA again took up the
                    issue about approaching the Honduran Government for suitable land to be made
                    available some distance from the border. Gersony also brought the CIA and the
                    DOD into the camp-relocation issue, so when ARA began to re-think its position
                    about asking the Honduran Government for a new offer of land, the two agencies
                    lent support. Both agencies saw that moving the camps to the new area would
                    benefit their strategy. The UNHCR was delighted since the new camp would be in
                    compliance with UNHCR norms (a minimum of 25 kilometers from the border). That
                    meant better protection for the refugees from the frequent gunfire between
                    rebels and Salvadoran soldiers. The rebels were probably unhappy since they lost
                    a convenient R and R area. The Hondurans benefitted handsomely because the rent
                    paid by the UNHCR for the land was relatively generous. The Honduran Government
                    also agreed to patrol the perimeter of the refugee camp so that the Salvadoran
                    army would not enter in pursuit of rebels and shoot up the refugees and to
                    prevent the guerrillas from using it for an R and R spot. The DOD expanded its
                    military assistance program to offer training to the Honduran military in
                    connection with the patrols.</p>
                <p>My office had the reverse problem with the ad hoc camp for the Nicaraguan
                    refugees on the border between Honduras and Nicaragua in the area called the
                    Meskito Coast. The reason was that the Contras were using that camp for R and R.
                    ARA did not want that camp moved at all. Of course, the UNHCR insisted that it
                    be moved for the safety of the refugees and in keeping with the usual norms
                    regarding minimum distances. ARA really had no rational argument against moving
                    the camp, so it asked the Honduran Government to stall on making land available
                    elsewhere.</p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>The UNHCR was not dissuaded by the tactics of ARA. As an organization with solid
                    credibility in the US, the UNHCR could mount an effective campaign to support
                    its principles. For decades, the US was the principal donor and provided strong
                    diplomatic support to the UNHCR as part of our anti-Communist strategy. We were
                    its largest donor and had an informal arrangement that the Deputy High
                    Commissioner would be an American. The UNHCR informally and quietly made its
                    case about moving the Honduran camp to the U.S. Congress and the American media.
                    Soon the White House became involved with ARA on the other side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Ollie North still?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Ollie North played a leading role. He threatened our Bureau and the UNHCR
                    with all sorts of things. My boss, the DAS for Refugee Assistance, Gene Dewey,
                    took on Ollie's challenge. Gene was a political appointee of the Reagan
                    Administration and brought impressive credentials to the job. (He was a West
                    Point graduate, a retired Army Colonel with an outstanding record as a combat
                    helicopter pilot in Vietnam, and as a coordinator for relief operations in
                    Biafra.) Gene was not bluffed by Ollie North's military exploits or his position
                    on the National Security Council. Gene had logic, precedent, and strong
                    political support on his side. Ollie huffed and puffed, but he could not blow
                    the UNHCR house down. The UNHCR was able to work out an arrangement with the
                    Honduran Government to move the camp. There were internal security reasons the
                    Honduran Government wanted the camp to be moved. The Honduran Government was not
                    getting along with the Meskito Indians. The Government did not want a refugee
                    camp in the midst of the area inhabited by the Meskitos. There was concern that
                    with the Contras moving back and forth and the Nicaraguan Army in pursuit there
                    would be too many opportunities for the Meskitos to obtain weapons. So when the
                    UNHCR requested land elsewhere, the Government decided in its own interest to
                    comply. I was just delighted when the Salvadoran and Nicaraguan camps were
                    moved.</p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>My tour as Office Director for ENA was coming to an end about the time Gene Dewey
                    was planning to depart the Bureau to become the Deputy High Commissioner for the
                    UNHCR. The USG had decided to support Jean-Pierre Hocke, the Director of
                    Operations at the International Committee of the Red Cross, for the
                    soon-to-be-vacant position of High Commissioner. Hocke was chosen by the UN
                    Secretary General for the job. Hocke then chose Gene to be his deputy. They had
                    worked together in Biafra under difficult and dangerous conditions and had
                    become good personal and professional friends. With Gene's departure, Jim
                    Purcell asked me to serve as an interim Deputy Assistant Secretary of State
                    (DAS). My responsibilities were to coordinate worldwide assistance to refugees.
                    The two other DAS's had responsibilities for Management and Finances (Bob
                    Funseth) and for Resettlement of Refugees in the USA (Richard English). After I
                    had served in the job for four or five months, Jim told me he had submitted my
                    name to become officially the Assistance DAS. I was pleased at the honor. After
                    a month, Jim was summoned to the Director General's Office and informed that
                    because the Department had lost its discrimination suit in Federal Court
                    (alleging that women were systematically prevented from advancing proportionate
                    to their numbers), my promotion to the DAS position was denied. He was given a
                    list of seven women and told to choose one to fill the DAS slot for Refugee
                    Assistance. I was certainly disappointed, but I considered the Director
                    General's decision in context, so I knew that I had not been rejected because of
                    my performance or potential.</p>
                <p>Within a few weeks, I left the DAS job and became the Executive Assistant to the
                    Refugee Coordinator, Jonathan Moore. This was a position created for me to help
                    bridge the gap until I could move into my next job. Basically, I did special,
                    short-term jobs for both the Coordinator and for Jim Purcell. The most
                    interesting task was to sort out some cases of fraud in the refugee processing
                    office in Khartoum, Sudan.</p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>When our Refugee Coordinator in Khartoum, Frank Moss, cabled RP in February 1987,
                    that he had discovered evidence of fraud in several cases of Ethiopian refugees
                    seeking resettlement in the US, Jim Purcell and Bob Funseth asked me to fly to
                    Khartoum to determine the full extent of the fraud and, if possible, to identify
                    the perpetrators. (The Processing Office was run not by the Embassy, but by a
                    Non-Governmental Organization under contract to RP.) They counted on my
                    experience in the area and my knowledge of Amharic to enable me to resolve the
                    problem. I departed within a few days. As I quickly learned, the lax security
                    measures in the Processing Office enabled most of the Ethiopian workers to have
                    access to the files. One, two, or more of the Ethiopian workers took advantage
                    of the free access to alter the files to benefit their friends, relatives, or
                    bribe payers. We undertook a thorough examination of each of the nearly 1,000
                    files. Fortunately, there was a master ledger that was kept locked in the
                    Director's safe and only he and his assistant had access to it. This document
                    was our Rosetta Stone. While the ledger contained considerably less information
                    each person than the individual refugee files, we could crosscheck data to see
                    where there were discrepancies. The essence of the fraud was twofold: to help
                    some people jump the queue by a year or two or to give new identities to people
                    who had been initially rejected as not being eligible for the program, i.e.
                    Ethiopians who were resident in the Sudan and who wanted to go to the US. After
                    several weeks, we were able to say with great assurance that less than a dozen
                    files had been altered. Of these, only four refugees had traveled to the US.
                    With these four, it turned out they would have been eligible for resettlement,
                    but they jumped the queue. The others were still in Khartoum waiting to depart.
                    I interviewed all the workers several times. On the basis of family or close
                    social relationships between the persons we pinpointed as having benefitted from
                    the altered records and the workers who had access to the files, I concluded
                    that three of the Ethiopian workers were most likely the actual perpetrators or,
                    at a minimum, had knowledge of the fraud. Since we did not have absolute proof,
                    we did not turn their names over to the Sudan authorities, but allowed them to
                    resign.</p>
                <p>I was so pleased to leave Khartoum and return to Washington after three months.
                    The mission itself was arduous, but the harsh living conditions in Khartoum
                    (security concerns, heat, sandstorms, lack of amenities, an anti-American
                    atmosphere, and other negatives) made living there particularly onerous. The
                    kindness and generosity of Frank and Kathy Moss provided a welcome relief from
                    the rigors of the environment. One month after I returned home, I was shocked to
                    read that the small hotel in Khartoum, where I had stayed, was blown up by
                    terrorists with heavy loss of life. A week later, one of the Americans at the
                    Embassy was killed. I had only several more weeks in RP before moving to my next
                    assignment.</p>

                <p>BUCHE: I saw a notice that an office directorship was coming open in the summer
                    for the technical agencies of the UN, and I thought this would be very
                    interesting. The technical agencies, the Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the World
                    Health Organization (WHO), the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the
                    International Labor Organization (ILO), and others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Post and Telegraph?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Yes, but the name of the organization is the Universal Postal Union (UPU).
                    It is the oldest existing international organization, and has its headquarters
                    in Bern, Switzerland. There was also the International Civil Aviation
                    Organization in Montreal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, ICAO.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: ICAO. Also in the portfolio of the office were the International Maritime
                    Organization (IMO) in London, and the World Tourism Organization (WTO) in
                    Madrid. There were also two UN organizations in Nairobi dealing with the
                    environment and with housing. I thought working with UN technical organizations
                    would be fascinating. I looked forward to working with officials in the UN
                    system and in our own Government on a wide-range of issues. I realized that
                    there were technical issues that we would be involved in, but I was assured the
                    technical aspects would be primarily handled by the Departments of Commerce,
                    Labor, HHS (Health and Human Services), Transport, Energy, the Postal Service,
                    the Coast Guard, and others. The problems I would be dealing with were said to
                    be financial and political. I knew two of the officers in IO/T, and was quite
                    impressed during the job interview with the supervising DAS, Sandy Vogelgesang.
                    So I bid for the job, and was accepted. I began work as the Office Director in
                    the Office of the UN Technical Agencies (IO/T) in August 1987. I was told during
                    the interview that a new element of the job would include an international
                    response to AIDS.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Yes. I was told I would be working with the CDC, the Center for Disease
                    Control in Atlanta, as well as with the WHO on the AIDS issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>I began my work in IO/T with great enthusiasm. Gradually I realized there were
                    some negative aspects of the job that I had not anticipated, namely the caliber
                    of my staff. In the staffing pattern, there were eight slots for officers (in
                    addition to my slot) and three for support staff. Of the officer positions under
                    me, four were reserved for the Civil Service and four for the Foreign Service.
                    The Civil Service incumbents were first class; the Foreign Service incumbents
                    were not. In fact, the fourth FS slot (for environmental issues) was not even
                    filled. My predecessor planned to retire after completing his tour of duty with
                    IO/T in the summer of 1987, so I discovered he had made no effort to recruit the
                    “best and the brightest” FSO's available to fill the jobs when the incumbents
                    rotated out in that summer. He basically left the task to Central Personnel.</p>
                <p>I knew before seeking the job in IO that the Bureau did not have a good
                    reputation in the Department because it was headed by Alan Keyes, a Reagan
                    appointee well known for his antipathy toward the UN. I had heard rumors that
                    Keyes was on the way out because Secretary George Shultz found working with him
                    was difficult. I anticipated a few months under Keyes and then a new Assistant
                    Secretary. What I had not anticipated in considering the job was the extent of
                    the financial damage inflicted on the UN technical agencies because of the
                    severe cut back in contributions from the United States as recommended by Keyes
                    and enacted by Congress. A third surprise for me was the large amount of time I
                    (and others in the Bureau) had to spend to counter any progress or advances
                    within the UN system by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Our
                    anti-PLO policy found practically no support from our traditional allies. It was
                    seen as futile and crafted largely for domestic purposes. We were constantly
                    drafting instruction cables to our delegates at UN meetings telling them how to
                    try to thwart the PLO's efforts to gain observer status or the right to
                    speak.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was something of a non-starter. I mean, there's
                        nowhere tgo with that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Well, we tried. Our delegations stood up and threatened to leave the
                    organization or cut off our funding if the PLO achieved any advance in its
                    status.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression of Alan Keyes. I keep seeing him referred to as a
                    former diplomat, and the people I've talked to are rather dismissive of him for
                    his time in the State Department. He was seen as just another political
                    appointee.</p>
                <p>BUCHE: He was a typical political appointee, in that he brought a strong personal
                    ideology to the job. I do not know about the relations between Reagan's first
                    Secretary of State and Keyes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Haig?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>BUCHE: Yes, Haig. I do know that Shultz and Keyes did not get along, at least
                    during the two months I served under him. The talk in IO was that Shultz did not
                    read Keyes' memos and pretty much ignored him. The other top officials take
                    their cues from the Secretary, so Alan was isolated within the Department. He
                    had no choice but to resign. What exactly precipitated the problem between
                    Shultz and Keyes, I do not know. I guess it was basically Keyes' enmity toward
                    the UN. This had to be unacceptable to the Secretary since some of our foreign
                    policy goals depended on the UN for success. Keyes was the force behind the
                    change in long-standing U.S. policy regarding the payment of our dues to the
                    various United Nations organizations. What he proposed and sold to the White
                    House was the scheme to skip a year of paying our dues. Normally Congress would
                    approve the budget for the Department sometime between late September and
                    December for the fiscal year, which began on October 1. The Department would the
                    pay the UN early in January at the beginning of the UN's fiscal year, which was
                    concurrent with the calendar year. The UN regulations encouraged member states
                    to pay in full early in the year or at a minimum, make a partial payment and
                    indicate when and how much for the subsequent payments. Technically, a member
                    state could wait until the end of the calendar year to pay without being
                    considered in arrears. Mostly the small states were guilty of this practice of
                    late-paying. Keyes argued effectively that the US could save an entire year's
                    contribution (over $500 million) by delaying our payments at the beginning of
                    the calendar year and making our contribution in late December. Since we were
                    the heaviest contributor (usually around a quarter of the budgets), by delaying
                    our contribution to the very end of the year, we caused a severe cash-flow
                    problem for many of the UN organizations, which had small cash reserves. What
                    made the financial problems even worse for the organizations was the growing
                    political fight between the Administration and Congress over Central America,
                    which delayed the appropriation process for the Department. Thus our payments to
                    the UN were not made in late December, but rather in late January or February.
                    This practice instigated by Alan Keyes was the beginning of our UN dues deficit
                    policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>Another practice pushed by Keyes (and readily supported by the Reagan White
                    House) was setting a high price for “in-kind” contributions for the UN
                    peacekeeping operations and using these inflated figures to offset our assessed
                    payments. The USG (and other countries with modern military air capabilities)
                    often responded to requests from the UN for air transport of supplies or
                    soldiers for peacekeeping operations. The USG would carry out the assigned
                    missions and months later submit an invoice to the UN charging an inflated price
                    for the services performed. When the services were requested (usually in a
                    crisis situation), there was seldom a fixed price agreed to by the member
                    states. The underlying assumption was that the UN was the organization created
                    and supported by the member states and that member states, on a voluntary basis,
                    would carry out requests by the UN at a fair and reasonable cost. This was
                    particularly the case with the five Permanent Members of the Security Council,
                    since no UN peacekeeping operation could be carried out if any one of the Perm
                    Five objected. Our practice of inflating the charge for services was heavily
                    criticized by the UN, as well as by other member states, in particular by our
                    NATO allies. Our practice was seen as underhanded and unbecoming of a great
                    power. Our practice brought not only a degree of tawdriness in our dealings with
                    the UN, but it weakened the peacekeeping operations by making available less
                    cash than required.</p>
                <p>Keyes was praised by the conservatives in the US and the anti-UN crowd. His
                    antipathy toward the UN caused serious problems for the United States with that
                    organization long after he left the Department of State. There was rejoicing in
                    IO (and probably in the Secretary's suite) when Keyes resigned. Reagan's next
                    appointee to the job was more subtle than Keyes, but he was also no friend of
                    the UN.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: Rich Williamson. He was a lawyer from Chicago. He had previously served a
                    few years as Ambassador (a political appointee of Reagan) at the US Mission to
                    the UN in Vienna. He left that job to become legal counsel to a corporation
                    which soon was bought out. Williamson profited handsomely from the buyout. He
                    had millions in his pocket and wanted to do something in Washington toward the
                    end of the Reagan Administration. He accepted the job as Assistant Secretary for
                    IO. He wanted to cut back our traditional contribution of 25% of the UN budgets.
                    He also wanted to downsize many of the UN specialized agencies. He found support
                    at the White House and on the Hill. There was little support in the Department
                    of State for reducing our contributions to the UN or for UN cutbacks. There was
                    some strong opposition to the suggestion in the other Departments which had
                    dealings with various UN agencies, for example: the Department of Labor and the
                    ILO; HHS and the WHO, the Department of Energy and the IAEA; and the Department
                    of Commerce and the ITU.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he politically powerful enough, so that the upper
                        branches othe Department of State were not saying, “Cut out this
                        nonsense?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: He was not that powerful in himself, but there were people in Congress,
                    the NSC, and the White House who were vibrating on the same resonance. It was
                    the UN he was trying to downsize - that was something that the Reagan White
                    House was not going to oppose. He was preaching to the choir. There was another
                    political appointee in IO; she was a DAS. She was stridently anti-UN and was a
                    holdover from the Keyes' era. She certainly pushed the ideas within her circles.
                    Most of the career officials in IO thought that Williamson's ideas were not good
                    policy. Secretary Shultz had other things on his mind, and did not personally
                    become involved until late in the game. The issue which galvanized Shultz to
                    take a position was an action memo in which Williamson asked the Secretary to
                    approve a process in which the US would unilaterally reduce its contribution
                    level to the UN Secretariat and other UN specialized agencies to a maximum of
                    20% (from the current 25%). Shultz rejected the request. He also wrote on the
                    margins of the memo his thoughts on the issue. In summary, they were along the
                    following lines: We are a founding member of the UN and a big power, and this is
                    not the way to act. Reducing our percentage should be a long-term goal, and we
                    can work toward that end, but we do not simply announce the fact and force the
                    organization and the other member states to adjust. Assistant Secretary
                    Williamson lost credibility with the Secretary with that memo.</p>
                <p>The Williamson approach to the Palestinian issue in UN bodies (no augmentation of
                    Palestinian presence) was no different from the Keyes' policy. Actually, the
                    policy guidelines were determined by the White House and the NSC, and Keyes or
                    Williamson were entrusted with carrying out the policy on a day-to-day basis in
                    the many UN fora. The IO and NEA lawyers had their work cut out for them as they
                    parsed the UN resolutions. Does this resolution increase PLO representation or
                    is it just saying the same thing with new language? Our diplomats, whenever they
                    went to an international conference, were not to make any decisions or speak on
                    anything involving Palestine or Israel without sending the full text and
                    background to the Department. The draft resolutions would be vetted at the
                    highest levels in the Department to make sure that not one millimeter was gained
                    as far as the PLO was concerned. All of us in IO spent large amounts of our time
                    on the PLO issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>A result of the Keyes' initiative, which hit months after he resigned, was the
                    10% cutback in the money Congress appropriated for the UN specialized agencies.
                    The UN technical agencies generally do not have an assessed budget. They depend
                    on voluntary contributions of member states for their operations. We had 10%
                    less money in 1988 to distribute to the specialized agencies than we had in
                    1987. We could have made a simple 10% cut across the board. Assistant Secretary
                    Williamson, however, chose a more intelligent approach, but one that would open
                    the Bureau to immense pressures from a multitude of supporters for the various
                    specialized agencies. He and the DAS's decided that we would apportion the money
                    according to several criteria, namely how important was the agency to USG
                    interests and how well was the agency managed. These were admittedly
                    impressionistic and subjective guidelines, but they were intellectually
                    defensible. We agreed that it would be preferable to set up a set of matrices to
                    guide us rather than treat all the agencies the same way. The 10%
                    across-the-board cut would penalize the organizations that fulfill our goals and
                    are well managed and would reward the agencies that were not doing what we would
                    like and/or were badly managed.</p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>We set up an elaborate system of grading the organizations. We came up with three
                    categories - those that would not take any cut; those that would take a ten
                    percent cut; and those that would take a nineteen percent cut. We did this
                    preliminarily in-house, and then invited the rest of the U.S. Government to come
                    and join the discussions. As expected, the Departments whose UN counterparts
                    were left untouched were happy and those whose organizations were to be cut
                    protested. The technical agencies in my portfolio did rather well. WHO, IAEA,
                    ITU, ICAO were untouched, so HHS, DOE and DOD, DOC, and DOT were pleased. ILO
                    was slated to be cut by ten percent, so we listened to many protests. The United
                    Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) was to take a nineteen
                    percent cut, so the positive response from the Department of Commerce(DOC) about
                    the ITU was tempered considerably. The development agencies (UNDP, FAO, UNICEF,
                    and WFP) fared less well in our matrix. There were some small UN agencies, where
                    our traditional contribution was under $100,000, so we exempted them from any
                    cuts. We expected the various Department Secretaries to weigh in with Secretary
                    Shultz about the exercise, if their counterparts were to be cut. Elizabeth Dole,
                    who was Secretary of Labor, vigorously protested the cut in the ILO. She wrote a
                    “Dear Colleague” letter to George Shultz, who had at one time also been
                    Secretary of Labor. So then Shultz got involved. Williamson again explained to
                    Shultz the basis for our decisions and reminded the Secretary that he had given
                    his approval to the process. He admitted that had given general approval, but
                    requested that the ILO not be hit with a ten percent cut. Rather than open the
                    entire process to further revisions, we shaved a few thousand dollars from
                    various organizations and found some other funds in an account so that we could
                    comply with the Secretary's directive to ease the burden on the ILO to nine
                    percent! We spent many days on the process and were satisfied that we had been
                    good stewards of the public's money. There was, however, considerable frostiness
                    on the part of our colleagues in the Departments of Labor, Commerce, and
                    Agriculture as a result of the exercise, not to mention the hard feelings and
                    sometimes harsh words from the heads of the UN agencies to our ambassadors,
                    visiting delegations, and to us in IO. We thought that if the Congress repeated
                    its performance the following year, we might give serious consideration to an
                    across-the board cut.</p>
                <p>Just as we were finishing the process of allotting the money from the exercise, a
                    new crisis hit. I learned about it while at the Buche-family reunion in
                    Richmond, Indiana. I turned on my TV in the morning of July 3, 1988, to see the
                    men's finals at Wimbledon. On the screen, however, was the Chairman of the Joint
                    Chiefs, Admiral Crowe. He was explaining how a US Navy destroyer, the USS
                    Vincennes, in the Persian Gulf had mistakenly shot down an IranAir Boeing
                    (Flight IR 655) with 290 persons aboard, killing them all.</p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>Since the International Civil Aviation Authority (ICAO) had jurisdiction in such
                    cases, I realized I would be heavily involved in the crisis. The Pentagon
                    immediately ordered a full investigation of the incident. The ICAO Council
                    President convoked an extraordinary session at the request of Iran. The issue
                    was put on the agenda of the UN Security Council. The USG was in full
                    damage-control mode. The Department of State had the lead, and IO was the lead
                    Bureau. We did research on the ICAO rules and precedents. We resurrected the
                    files on the Soviet shoot-down of the Korean Air 007 in 1983. (The Iranians and
                    the Soviets were playing much of our own rhetoric back to us.) We plotted a
                    strategy, in essence, admit our mistake, express regrets, offer compensation,
                    and avoid a formal condemnation. Our plan was accepted within the USG, although
                    there was some reluctance on the part of DOD pending the completion of the
                    formal investigation. We argued we had to take the highroad at the very
                    beginning to avoid a nasty condemnation and linkage with the KAL 007
                    catastrophe. We could not wait for the formal investigation hoping to show some
                    technical errors on the part of the Iranians. The Pentagon investigation (the
                    Fogarty Report) turned out to be more damning of the Vincennes' actions than the
                    original version of the incident.</p>
                <p>Rich Williamson represented the USG at the ICAO session, while Vice President
                    Bush spoke for the US at the Security Council. Williamson's approach was that of
                    an attorney trying to make the best case from a weak brief, and thus he
                    emphasized our own investigation of the case, our offer of compensation, and the
                    imposition of improved procedures to avoid similar incidents in the future. We
                    fared pretty well at the ICAO session and were able to buy time for additional
                    investigations and subsequent meetings. Vice President Bush took a different
                    tack at the Security Council. While expressing regret over the IR 655 incident,
                    Bush lambasted Iran for a series of actions, including the hostages. (Bush was
                    running for the Presidency, so he scrapped our draft text and had his political
                    writers prepare a speech aimed for the American voters rather than the delegates
                    at the UNSC.) Iran was still relatively isolated in the diplomatic world because
                    of the hostages and ongoing revolutionary actions, so there was a reluctance by
                    other states to go beyond pro-forma support. The Soviets were not about to risk
                    the new relationship with the US by going overboard in support of Iran on the IR
                    655 issue. My office worked closely with the Office of Civil Aviation and the
                    Legal Adviser in State, with DOD, and the Department of Transportation to write
                    briefing papers, talking points, and instruction cables to our delegation in
                    Montreal for the series of hearings, investigations, and meetings at ICAO over
                    many months. In March 1989, the ICAO Council culminated the process by passing a
                    resolution that was a compromise. The Council “deeply deplored the tragic
                    incident”, but did not condemn the US since the shoot-down was the result of
                    errors. The Secretary was pleased with the outcome and commended Rich
                    Williamson. Rich, in turn, praised DAS Sandy Vogelgesang, Neil Boyer, my
                    principal deputy, and myself. Several months later, I received the Department's
                    Superior Honor Award for my handling of the IR 655 crisis.</p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>Soon after the conclusion of the IR655 issue, Williamson resigned. The Bush
                    administration had taken office and had another candidate for the position. John
                    Bolton, a Washington lawyer, became the new Assistant Secretary for
                    International Organizations. John made it clear from the very beginning of his
                    tenure that there would be no change during his watch regarding the PLO issue in
                    the UN bodies. We were to continue to fight any attempt to enhance the PLO
                    position in any UN organization. There were several more sessions of UN
                    governing bodies before my scheduled departure date from IO/T. Thus I had to
                    update instructions for our delegations to oppose with every means any attempts
                    by the PLO to improve its status, even if this meant breaking with our NATO
                    allies. IO's number one priority was to thwart the PLO, even if in doing so we
                    would lose support from potential allies and thus fail on other UN issues of
                    importance to the USG!</p>
                <p>At the end of my two years in IO, I was ready to leave. I had been assigned as
                    the DCM to the U.S. Mission to the United Nations in Vienna. I was eager to
                    leave Washington and start my job in Vienna. It was an assignment I had eagerly
                    sought.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUCHE: I was the DCM at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations. The agencies for
                    which we were responsible were the Vienna-based UN organizations. These were the
                    UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), the formal name for the agency responsible
                    for the care and maintenance of the Palestinian refugees who had fled or been
                    expelled from Israel beginning in 1948, the International Atomic Energy Agency
                    (IAEA), and the UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). We also had
                    responsibilities for the UN Women's Commission and the UN Drug Agency. There
                    were some smaller offices, but our main business was with the above-mentioned
                    organizations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your main job?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>BUCHE: The main job was helping Ambassador Michael Newlin run the Mission. There
                    were a dozen officers and support staff assigned to the Mission. Mike wanted me
                    to handle the administration and personnel issues, and to be the focal point for
                    official visitors and to monitor incoming cables, and to work with the various
                    officers in drafting/editing our reporting cables. Since I had responsibility
                    for all of the Vienna-based agencies when I was in Washington, I knew them quite
                    well. I had more political, financial, and institutional expertise than the
                    staff at the Vienna Mission or my replacement as the IO/T Office Director, Tom
                    Martin. Accordingly, I could work confidently with the officers in Vienna or
                    Washington. Admittedly, I did not have the technical expertise of the nuclear
                    scientists and technicians seconded to the IAEA from the US Department of
                    Energy. They had the technical background, and I provided the political
                    guidance.</p>
                <p>Since the Cold War was coming to an end and the Iron Curtain was crumbling, there
                    were large numbers of official visitors coming to Vienna from Washington. I
                    believe many of our visitors had themselves accredited to a UN conference or
                    study group, so they could take the opportunity to visit Prague or Budapest from
                    Vienna. Unless the visitors were Congressmen or Senators, or high-ranking State
                    Department officials, Mike Newlin asked me to take care of them. (Accordingly, I
                    made many trips with the visitors over the weekends to Prague and Budapest.)
                    Some of the most demanding delegations were those for the annual meetings of the
                    UN Women's Commission. The delegations were completely female and were selected
                    by the White House as rewards for political contributions in behalf of President
                    Bush. The visiting women attended all the sessions (from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M), but
                    looked forward to the evening or weekend activities. We were asked to obtain
                    opera tickets, reservations to some of the best restaurants, and to make
                    arrangements for excursions to Budapest and Prague. I was requested to accompany
                    them to Budapest. Fortunately, the State Department sent along a seasoned
                    professional, Sharon Kotok, to help the Mission on the substantive business of
                    the Commission, namely to prepare for the Cairo Conference on Women and
                    Children. Sharon, Greg Sprow, the Mission officer responsible for the
                    Commission, the Ambassador, and I did whatever was required to carry out our
                    policy objectives for Cairo.</p>

                <p>Michael Newlin had been the Principal DAS in Consular Affairs before his Vienna
                    assignment. Before that, he was at the United Nations as the DCM to the
                    Ambassador, the Permanent Representative. During most of Newlin's posting to the
                    UN, the Permanent Representative was George Bush. So he was on very good terms
                    with President Bush.Ambassador Newlin chose me, in part, because we got along
                    together very well on both a personal and professional basis, as he was being
                    briefed by my staff and myself in Washington in preparation for taking charge of
                    the Mission. Once he was installed in Vienna, he appreciated the way I supported
                    the Mission. Also, I had an excellent reputation from my previous experiences as
                    a DCM. So when Mike considered the various candidates proposed to him by the
                    Foreign Service Personnel Office as his DCM, he quickly settled on me. Mike
                    headed a successful, proactive, and dedicated team. It was also a happy and
                    cohesive group of professionals. Vienna, from my first days there, was my most
                    enjoyable and interesting posting since Addis Ababa. For professional, cultural,
                    and family reasons, it was the zenith of my Foreign Service career.</p>
                <p>Q: You had been involved in budget paring. What was your impression of the UN
                    agencies that your mission was representing? How were they run?</p>
                <p>BUCHE: The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was considered one of the
                    best run of all the agencies. It was an independent agency that was an absolute
                    necessity because of the Cold War. Its purpose was twofold: to inspect for
                    violations of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and to provide technical
                    assistance for the peaceful use of nuclear energy. It was one of the few
                    international agencies where the Soviets, Chinese, Americans, Brits and others
                    would really concentrate on the business at hand. It was to the major powers'
                    interests that the agency be well-run and highly professional. The United
                    Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) was temporarily located in Vienna. The
                    UNRWA headquarters was moved to Vienna from Beirut because of the security
                    situation in Lebanon. (In the late 1990s, the headquarters was moved to Amman,
                    Jordan.) I was responsible for UNRWA matters between 1984-87, when I was in RP.
                    I had visited the camps and met on several occasions with the UNRWA leadership.
                    A career Italian diplomat, Giacomelli, was the Director General, and a
                    distinguished Foreign Service Officer and former Ambassador to Syria and
                    Algeria, Bill Eagleton, was his deputy. It was a huge agency with over two
                    million refugees in its care in five different countries. The leadership had to
                    walk a narrow line because of the political sensitivities of the refugees and
                    the host countries. An ongoing problem was the constant need to obtain more
                    funding from the donors to provide the refugees with education and health care,
                    and for some of the particularly vulnerable, food and shelter. We were impressed
                    with the ability of Giacomelli and Eagleton to keep the many disputes, protests,
                    and demonstrations localized and eventually to work out solutions. We did not
                    like UNIDO's performance when I was in Washington, and when I was in Vienna and
                    saw the organization and its newly-elected Director General, Domingo Siazon, up
                    close, my evaluation was confirmed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: UNIDO being -</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>BUCHE: United Nations Industrial Development Organization. The Reagan
                    Administration and Alan Keyes were determined to get rid of the previous head of
                    UNIDO, an Algerian named Abdul Rahman Kahane. He was a strong advocate of
                    socialism as the preferred system for the development of industry in the
                    third-world. Our chosen candidate was the Philippine Ambassador to Vienna,
                    Domingo Siazon. He was an outspoken advocate of capitalism and was favorably
                    disposed toward the United States. Our Embassy in Manila had worked with him and
                    gave him rave reviews. The UNIDO election was hard fought and bitter. The Kahane
                    had strong support from most of the Africans, some Middle Eastern countries, the
                    USSR and Eastern Europe, plus France and a few Scandinavians. We (and the
                    Philippines) lined up the Latins, some of the Middle East and Africa, and all of
                    Asia. For Keyes and the White House, the battle was ideological. Our Mission
                    Vienna had the task of much of the day-to-day campaigning. The Algerian was not
                    a good manager, regardless of his political leanings, so that was an effective
                    talking point. UNIDO fell into even greater disarray as the campaign progressed.
                    The final tally was close, but Siazon won. There were strong feelings and much
                    bitterness within the organization and in the Vienna embassies and missions over
                    the election. Many of Kahane's supporters were waiting for Siazon to make a
                    serious mistake in order to pounce.</p>
                <p>After Siazon won, he replaced many of the top officials in UNIDO. Because of the
                    UN staff regulations, the buy-outs were quite costly. The US decided to give a
                    little extra money to make up for some of the funds lost when the member states
                    supporting the Algerian cut back on their contributions. (Funding for UNIDO was
                    voluntary.) Siazon decided that he had to mend fences with some of the
                    third-world countries which had supported Abdul Rahman Kahane, so he offered
                    jobs to their nationals, although their qualifications were weak. He also gave
                    some study or feasibility contracts to politically important persons. He brought
                    in a dozen Philippine nationals (about half in staff-support jobs). Siazon's
                    wife obtained a job with the IAEA. It was widely assumed in Vienna that he used
                    his influence in her behalf. Despite the poor condition of the organization when
                    Siazon took over, there was the expectation that after a year of transition, he
                    and the new team would put UNIDO on the right track. We expected Siazon's
                    principal deputy (an American, the brother of Senator Warner of Virginia) to
                    play a major role on the administrative side. Unfortunately, there was no quick
                    turn around in UNIDO. (I came into IO/T at this point.)</p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>Our mission was quite aware of what was happening and reported accurately, not
                    only on what was happening in UNIDO, but about the hypercritical attitudes of
                    the diplomats in Vienna. When IO had to make cuts, there was no way we could
                    justify exempting UNIDO from a heavy hit. Siazon was “our man”, but he was
                    failing in our eyes to manage the organization the way we expected. That may
                    have been an impossible task for Siazon, given the prior history of the
                    organization, but when forced to choose between such well-run and vital
                    organizations such as the IAEA, ITU, WHO, and a few others and UNIDO, the latter
                    had to be put in the lowest category. Of course, word got out that the USG was
                    cutting back on its usual voluntary contribution to UNIDO. That made Siazon's
                    task even harder. Ambassador Newlin in Vienna and we in Washington spoke with
                    Siazon and with Warner about what we wanted, but only part of our message sank
                    in. The organization was drifting. We wanted greater transparency in the
                    financial aspects of UNIDO. We wanted the operational funds to go for real
                    market feasibility studies, and not for “pay-off” writings that had no value. We
                    proposed that a few additional experienced Americans in key middle-manager jobs
                    would help. We were paying roughly a quarter of the budget and wanted more
                    positions, something between ten and fifteen percent of the professional slots.
                    Congress was quite insistent that American representation in UN bodies be
                    roughly proportionate to our contributions. The rule of thumb was that we should
                    have about ten percent less in jobs than our percentage contribution. Under the
                    Algerian, almost all the Americans had practically been squeezed out of the
                    organization. When Siazon took over, we had around seven percent of the
                    positions. We thought it was catch-up time. Despite offering some well-qualified
                    candidates, we were turned down in most cases. Siazon used the vacated slots to
                    hire his own preferences. As I mentioned above, these persons were only
                    minimally qualified. Our criticism of Siazon was both very parochial on the jobs
                    issue, as well as broader on the achievement of the goals and objectives of the
                    organization.</p>
                <p>When I went to Vienna, I was determined to be objective in reporting on UNIDO. I
                    could see mitigating circumstances for Siazon's actions and appreciated the
                    Mission's nuanced reporting. There were, however, some decisions (and
                    statements) by Siazon that bothered the Ambassador and me. We were finding
                    ourselves in the difficult and uncomfortable position of defending the Siazon
                    and Warner against the criticism of the Europeans, particularly the French,
                    Belgians, and Nordics, when we, too, were critical of what was happening. The
                    longer I stayed, the more critical I became. I learned so much of the inside,
                    day-to-day activities of the organization from our superb Mission UNIDO officer,
                    Greg Sprow. He was observant, had developed valuable contacts, and could
                    communicate so clearly. Mike Newlin was more patient, but he, too, eventually
                    realized that Siazon was falling down in the job and that the USG had made a
                    mistake in pushing his candidacy.</p>
                <p>The Europeans were really honing in on UNIDO. They uncovered some uses of small
                    discretionary funds and some procurement policies that were not clearly illegal,
                    but did not pass the “smell” test. Siazon apparently had decided to mend his
                    fences with the African embassies, but not with the Europeans. He was like a
                    ward politician. He calculated who could be bought off and who could be ignored.
                    He put the Europeans in the latter category.</p>
                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>The first major confrontation developed over UNIDO's decision to upgrade the
                    computer capabilities of the organization. They had several systems of
                    computers, and they did not function as a network. Siazon and Warner, along with
                    some in-house advisers decided to purchase a big mainframe computer. To make the
                    US happy, they chose an IBM. There were many computer specialists inside and
                    outside the organization who were saying that a large mainframe was not the way
                    to go. It was not only too expensive, but using PC's was the wave of the future.
                    Siazon was not technically minded, and his insistence on a large mainframe
                    seemed to be rooted in wanting a machine as large as the IAEA's computer. (The
                    IAEA, as an organization dealing with nuclear issues, needed a large mainframe.)
                    There was no need for UNIDO to have a mainframe for 99% of its tasks. If there
                    were a need now and then, UNIDO could make arrangements to lease time on the
                    IAEA machine, since the two organizations were in the same building. UNIDO's
                    plans were attacked by the Europeans as financially and technically unsound. We
                    were caught in a bind. We had to defend Siazon, Warner, and IBM. When Siazon and
                    Warner insisted on moving forward with the IBM purchase despite the European
                    objections, the Europeans were enraged. They threatened to withdraw funding, and
                    eventually forced Siazon to agree to a re-study of the issue. Outside
                    consultants (including some Americans) were brought in, and they recommended
                    going the PC route. UNIDO had no choice but to comply. Warner worked out a deal
                    with IBM that resulted in only a nominal penalty for voiding the contract. The
                    entire affair was embarrassing to us. We had to use so much good will and
                    “political capital” to save Siazon from being publicly censured and forced out
                    of office. Although he survived, his reputation in Vienna was tarnished, and
                    UNIDO as an institution suffered. Canada announced that it was leaving the
                    organization and gave the necessary one-year's notice. Australia and Belgium
                    threatened to follow.</p>
                <p>We were in the awkward position of defending our prot�g�, Siazon, when we, too,
                    had lost trust in him. He seemed to be oblivious to criticism from the USG or
                    the Europeans. Washington was by now also quite concerned because of the
                    financial condition of UNIDO. Washington was afraid that we would have to
                    contribute more than our customary amount to keep the organization afloat.
                    (UNIDO was supported almost entirely from voluntary contributions, and the
                    Europeans had reduced their funding to show their displeasure at Siazon.)
                    Several officials came from Washington to see at first hand what could be done.
                    I hosted a lunch for the officials and Siazon. Siazon came a few minutes late.
                    He explained that he was on the phone with his personal banker and was delighted
                    to announce that he had just made several thousand dollars profit from a
                    speculation involving a foreign exchange transaction. Although there was nothing
                    illegal about what he had done, it was so incongruous to us that he would boast
                    about a personal speculative gain when his organization was making plans for
                    layoffs because of financial difficulties and he was asking the USG to increase
                    its voluntary funding of UNIDO.</p>
                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>The Europeans did not give up their efforts to force out Siazon. We decided that
                    we were not going to waste any more capital propping up the institution by
                    increasing our funding or defending the indefensible. Siazon saw the handwriting
                    on the wall and resigned to become the Philippine Ambassador to Japan. (He had
                    served there before, had a Japanese wife, and spoke Japanese.) When the
                    Philippine Government changed, he left Japan to become the Foreign Minister.
                    Apparently his mismanagement of UNIDO had no effect on his subsequent career.
                    Mike Newlin and I had to spend so much time on UNIDO that we sometimes delegated
                    responsibilities to other members of our staff for carrying out a few tasks with
                    the IAEA or UNRWA that perhaps should have been handled by us. Of course, that
                    all changed with the Gulf War.</p>
                <p>

                <p>BUCHE: The Gulf War catapulted the International Atomic Energy Agency into
                    strategic importance. The UN Security Council gave the IAEA the responsibility
                    to conduct the inspection missions in Iraq to determine the status of that
                    country's nuclear program. Our Mission was the focal point for carrying out
                    Washington's instructions for discussions and negotiations with Hans Blix, the
                    Director General, and the other top officials of the IAEA regarding the mandated
                    inspections. Our Mission staff was augmented by two officers from the CIA and
                    several nuclear-detection specialists from the Department of Energy. They
                    provided us with the technical expertise we needed in our discussions with the
                    IAEA on the modalities, interpretation of findings, communications, security,
                    logistics, and other aspects involving the inspections. Our reports of the
                    meetings with the IAEA were read by the top policy makers in Washington and
                    shared with our Coalition Partners. (For the sake of efficiency and clarity of
                    purpose, Washington obtained the concurrence of our major Coalition Partners
                    that the US Mission in Vienna would be the focal point for discussions with the
                    IAEA on the inspections.) The IAEA was sending its own reports to the UN
                    Secretary General of the discussions. To avoid any confusion or
                    misunderstandings in the reporting by the IAEA or ourselves, we informally
                    compared notes at the conclusion of each of our discussions. The inspections
                    took place, and the results were spectacular. The IAEA team discovered the
                    secret laboratories and the infrastructure used by the Iraqis to construct
                    nuclear weapons. The conclusions of the IAEA were that the Iraqis were about a
                    year away from their first bomb. The IAEA had the mandate from the UN Security
                    Council not only to seek out the clandestine nuclear program and to report on
                    the findings, but also to destroy the Iraqi capabilities to manufacture weapons
                    of mass destruction. The IAEA succeeded brilliantly. The Security Council
                    accepted the report by the IAEA that the Iraqi program had been uncovered and
                    dismantled. The inspections by other organizations for chemical and biological
                    weapons in Iraq were not so successful and thus were not accepted as conclusive
                    by the UNSC. The success of the IAEA resulted from many factors. First of all,
                    the IAEA was a superb organization and organized the inspection teams carefully.
                    The IAEA inspection teams were augmented by some outside specialists and helped
                    by intelligence data from several major powers, including the Soviets, and the
                    USA. Also, the nature of constructing a nuclear weapon required larger
                    facilities and more machinery than would be required for chemical or biological
                    weapons. Thus, the facilities would be harder to hide. Washington was paying
                    close attention to the developments over the six months of the various IAEA
                    inspections. We received daily telephone calls and cables from Washington. I
                    know on three occasions, President Bush himself phoned Ambassador Newlin to
                    discuss the inspections. Our IAEA reporting was commended frequently by
                    Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>After the IAEA inspections were completed, Ambassador Newlin decided to retire.
                    He had done a superb job and had also thoroughly enjoyed his tour of duty in
                    Vienna. With his friendship with President Bush and his excellent professional
                    credentials, he could have asked for and received another ambassadorship, but he
                    and his wife, Milena, wanted to enjoy their retirement. They had a daughter in
                    the Washington area, and wanted to see her more often. I was the charge ad
                    interim for a month, and then the new Ambassador, Jane Becker, arrived. She came
                    from IO, where she was the principal DAS. We got along quite well together.
                    There were no major crises involving our organizations in the time we were
                    together. After the UNIDO debacles and the strategic demands in connection with
                    the Iraqi inspections by the IAEA, I was pleased with this relatively calm
                    period. My successor, Tom Martin from IO/T, arrived at post in August 1992, so I
                    handed over to him my office and my responsibilities. I formally retired from
                    the Department of State on September 30, 1992, after thirty three years in the
                    Foreign Service. My career was exciting, challenging, and successful, but above
                    all, interesting and fulfilling.</p>
                <p>After I retired, Anike and I found a small, furnished apartment near St.
                    Stephan's Cathedral. She continued working with the Representative of the
                    Department of Defense to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. I
                    went to the University of Vienna as a post-graduate student in a special course
                    on Eastern Europe and the European Union. Given my diplomatic background, I was
                    asked by the Chairman of the International Relations Faculty, Professor Neuhaus,
                    to mentor three students from the Baltics. They were on a scholarship given by
                    the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I was delighted to help them during
                    the year, and in doing so, we developed friendships. I also had become a member
                    of one of the most prestigious choirs in Vienna, the Augustinerchor (Choir of
                    St. Augustine). I now had time to take special singing lessons and devote the
                    necessary hours to private practice and group rehearsals. Our son, John, moved
                    to Vienna upon his graduation from Northwestern University, so we were with him
                    again. In July 1993, Anike and I departed Vienna for me to take a position (pro
                    bono) as an Adjunct Professor of History at St. Meinrad College. I returned to
                    the institution, which had meant so much to me in my formative teenage years. I
                    was invited to return by my former classmate, Bob Sweeney, now Archabbot
                    Timothy, O.S.B.</p>
                <pb facs="0175" n="Page0175"/>
                <p>During my two years at St. Meinrad (August 1993 to June 1995), I twice taught a
                    two-semester course in U.S. Foreign Relations from the founding of the Republic
                    to the Gulf War. I used Walter LaFeber's The American Age as my text. I also
                    taught a seminar on the United Nations, with emphasis on the specialized
                    agencies. For the latter, I used several texts, plus my own notes and
                    recollections and many articles from periodicals and journals. I arranged a
                    symposium at St. Meinrad in November 1993 on Russia and Eastern Europe with
                    guest speakers from the German and Hungarian Embassies, plus the Department's
                    Policy Planning Staff. There was heavy conflict in the Balkans at this time, so
                    interest was high for the event. In January 1995, I conducted an intense,
                    two-week, inter-term seminar on U.S. economic development policy, with
                    particular emphasis on Africa. Retired Ambassador Ed Korry came to address the
                    students on the African portion. He had served four years in Ethiopia, and had
                    been asked by President Johnson to formulate a new approach for the USG's
                    economic development policy toward Africa. He helped me celebrate my 60th
                    birthday, when I gave a wine-tasting party for the faculty.</p>
                <p>I was considering a third year at St. Meinrad, but Anike wisely counseled a
                    return to Washington instead. Her point was that I had successfully put together
                    several courses and had enjoyed the challenge of teaching college students. If I
                    stayed a third year, I would be repeating much of what I had done before. She
                    emphasized that I needed further challenges, and these were not to be found at
                    St. Meinrad. Admittedly, my students were, for the most part, motivated and
                    intelligent, but their educational and cultural horizons and personal goals did
                    not involve foreign policy and international relations. The same could be said
                    of the faculty. Anike and I enjoyed being with the monks, faculty, and students
                    at St. Meinrad. We broadened our own knowledge and benefitted both spiritually
                    and intellectually from the experience. Our time at St. Meinrad was a positive
                    and fascinating interlude, but both of us wanted to return to a more
                    cosmopolitan setting.</p>
                <p>While my post-retirement activities are not a part of my Foreign Service career,
                    they involve foreign policy and may be of some interest to readers and
                    researchers. I will describe briefly my activities after returning to Washington
                    from St. Meinrad in the summer of 1995.After settling into our house, I began to
                    look around for something to do. I had the idea of working with Gene Dewey at
                    the Hunger Coalition on a voluntary basis. Gene was my supervisor when I was in
                    the Refugee Bureau of the Department in 1994-97. I admired him immensely and
                    figured he could use some assistance. I spoke with him and he was
                    enthusiastic.</p>
                <pb facs="0176" n="Page0176"/>
                <p>Several days before I was to begin, however, I received a call from Mark Freeman
                    with a fascinating offer - pro-bono work as an adviser in the newly-reopened
                    Cambodian Embassy in Washington. (Mark was a mutual friend of Richard Kochan and
                    myself and was currently heading the Asian Section of Meridian House, an NGO
                    involved with exchange visitors and technical assistance with developing
                    countries.) Diplomatic relations between the United States and Cambodia were
                    broken in 1975, when the Khmer Rouge took over the country. After years of
                    widespread starvation, torture, and murder by the Khmer Rouge against their own
                    countrymen, the KR leadership turned against their traditional enemies, the
                    Vietnamese. The KR met their match, when the Vietnamese, fresh fromthrowing out
                    the Americans, turned their military against the upstart Cambodians. After years
                    of guerilla warfare, the KR were driven into the western mountains of Cambodia.
                    The Vietnamese were not intent on remaining in Cambodia for the long term, so
                    through a series of international negotiations, the United Nations took over
                    running the country for two years.</p>
                <p>The country was totally devastated, first by the genocidal Khmer Rouge and then
                    by the incessant warfare between the Vietnamese Army and the KR. Few educated
                    Cambodians escaped slaughter by the KR. When the Vietnamese and then the United
                    Nations took over governing the country, some Cambodians returned from abroad to
                    take positions in the new Cambodia. The Cambodian King, Sihanouk, returned from
                    asylum in China to serve as a symbol of national unity and constitutional
                    monarch.</p>
                <p>There was a UN-sponsored national election which resulted in a two-way split in
                    power, including two Prime Ministers. The First Prime Minister was Prince
                    Raniridh, a son of King Sihanouk; the Second Prime Minister was Hun Sen, a
                    former Khmer Rouge official who defected and subsequently worked with the
                    Vietnamese. The two parties were bitter rivals and were intent on gaining
                    undisputed hegemony. All the government ministries, including the embassies, had
                    officials appointed from both parties.</p>
                <pb facs="0177" n="Page0177"/>
                <p>The Embassy in Washington had reopened in August 1995, after being shuttered and
                    sealed for twenty years. The Embassy staff was eager to serve their country, but
                    lacked the education, experience and language skills to function effectively in
                    Washington. Mark told me that Ambassador Var Houot at the newly-reopened
                    Cambodian Embassy in Washington was eagerly seeking a retired diplomat to help
                    him and the staff establish themselves with the USG, Congress, journalists,
                    investors, travel agents, et al. Ambassador Var told me that only two persons on
                    his staff had ever served overseas in an embassy and that he had no diplomatic
                    experience. Only one official at the Embassy spoke fluent English. The rest,
                    including the Ambassador, had only an intermediate working command of the
                    language. He wanted someone to advise him and his staff on almost every aspect
                    of running an embassy. I told him I was interested, but knew very little about
                    Cambodia. He said that was not important. What he wanted was someone experienced
                    in diplomacy and with knowledge of how the U.S. Government functioned. I checked
                    with the Department's Cambodian Desk Officer, Deborah Kingsland, to see how she
                    viewed the offer. She responded positively, since I could help resolve some of
                    the inevitable misunderstandings and miscommunications between the Department
                    and an inexperienced Embassy staff whose English was limited. I agreed to help
                    Ambassador Var for several months pro bono.</p>
                <p>My first task was to prepare for the visit of the Cambodian Foreign Minister. In
                    making the preparations, I became better acquainted with the Embassy staff and
                    how the officials interacted with one another. I did not handle the briefing
                    papers from the Cambodian side, since they were written by the Foreign
                    Minister's staff in Phnom Penh. I made the appointments and conferred with the
                    American officials handling the visit in State, AID, Treasury, and Commerce. I
                    asked the Ambassador what were the main points the Foreign Minister wanted to
                    raise. I then passed these on to my contacts so that they could prepare their
                    bosses to respond. In turn, they told me what was in the briefing papers on the
                    American side. This was standard procedure for any high-level visit. The basic
                    rule is that there must not be any surprises for the principals. The Foreign
                    Minister's trip went well and was followed by an official visit from the
                    Minister of Defense and then by other ministers. We followed the same
                    procedures. At the time of the early visits, there were no divisive major
                    bilateral issues between the two countries, and so the talks were positive.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Var and his staff were quick learners. Their English improved
                    significantly. They constantly sought help from me in understanding some fine
                    points or colloquial uses of English from their reading or from conversations
                    with Americans. They depended on me to write their letters and diplomatic notes,
                    but as their English improved, I asked them to do the first draft as a learning
                    exercise. I would then correct or re-write their draft and explain why I changed
                    their wording. I also published a monthly newsletter about economic and
                    commercial developments in Cambodia, emphasizing U.S. investments and potential
                    opportunities in the country. I really enjoyed my work. I was a combined teacher
                    and adviser.</p>
                <pb facs="0178" n="Page0178"/>
                <p>As Ambassador Var and I got to know each another better, we could frankly discuss
                    the increasingly, negative impact on Cambodia's relations with the USA resulting
                    from the internal political rivalries and violence between the two Prime
                    Ministers and their parties. Not only was the State Department concerned about
                    the increasing violence in Cambodia, but potential investors began to re-think
                    their plans.</p>
                <p>Even more ominous for Cambodia's economic development was the displeasure shown
                    by several influential Senators and Congressmen at the mounting numbers of human
                    rights violations. They threatened to block passage of a law that would restore
                    Cambodia's normal trading rights with the US. (After we broke relations in 1975,
                    practically no items from Cambodia were allowed to enter the United States.) The
                    Department of State and the Agency for International Development decided to cut
                    back economic assistance to Cambodia in reaction to the increasing number of
                    human-rights abuses.</p>
                <p>After several egregious examples of human rights abuses against journalists and
                    harassment against the well-known opposition figure, Sam Rainsey, became public,
                    Senator McCain wrote a letter to Prime Minister Raniridh, with copies to Hun
                    Sen, stating that he was greatly disturbed by the news and implying that his
                    support for legislation to grant Cambodia “Most Favored Nation” status (normal
                    trading rights) was in doubt. McCain asked for an explanation and a commitment
                    to safeguard the rights of dissenters. Raniridh responded with a high-handed
                    letter to Senator McCain denying any abuses in Cambodia and mentioning some
                    American sins of commission and omission in the human rights area. Raniridh
                    challenged McCain's right to criticize what was happening in Cambodia. The PM's
                    letter arrived by diplomatic pouch at the Embassy and the Ambassador was asked
                    to deliver the letter personally to the Senator.</p>
                <p>I saw the letter and was aghast. I told Ambassador Var that if he delivered the
                    letter as written, there would be terrible consequences, further cuts in
                    assistance from the U.S. and no chance of passing legislation for MFN for
                    Cambodia. Var was torn about what to do. He was a Hun Sen supporter and owed his
                    appointment to him. Var intensely disliked Raniridh. He would have been
                    personally delighted to see Raniridh publicly excoriated in the Senate and in
                    the U.S. press if the original letter were delivered. On the other hand, he was
                    a patriot and was working for the good of his country. He asked me to edit out
                    or soften the most offensive portions of the letter. I did so. Var then had the
                    problem of convincing someone very close to Raniridh to suggest he have the
                    letter re-written, possibly along the lines I suggested. Var hesitated for
                    several reasons. He was in the “opposition party” and did not have working
                    contacts with the inner circle of Prince Raniridh. Secondly, it was not in
                    Cambodian culture to question a decision, or in this case, a letter from a
                    higher official. I saw things quite differently and so I urged him to do his
                    duty as an ambassador and quickly, since the reply to the Senator was long
                    overdue. After several days of intense reflection, Var made a series of phone
                    calls to Phnom Penh.</p>
                <pb facs="0179" n="Page0179"/>
                <p>A new letter arrived. It was less offensive, but still had a tone that would
                    likely upset McCain. The text was certainly not what I would have written, given
                    the importance of MFN to Cambodia and the powerful position of the Senator on
                    the issue. Var took the letter to McCain and did a superb job of talking away
                    (and apologizing for) the actual words of the letter. McCain lectured Var about
                    human rights and how the actions of Cambodia's feuding Prime Ministers were
                    rapidly dissipating the support of the United States for a nation that had
                    suffered so terribly over the past two decades. In the end, he assured Var that
                    he still supported MFN. McCain then wrote a sharp letter back to Raniridh, with
                    copies to the Embassy and Hun Sen. I told Var that he should strongly advise his
                    Prime Minister to acknowledge the McCain letter, but write nothing repeat
                    nothing further. Fortunately for all concerned, that is what happened.</p>
                <p>I had been with the Embassy for five months and was also concerned about the
                    direction Cambodia was heading. I was becoming queasy about defending the
                    Cambodian Government's actions. I spoke to Var about my misgivings and told him
                    that I had fulfilled my promise to help out for about a half year. I told him I
                    would leave in several weeks, but that Anike would continue to come to the
                    Embassy several times a week to help with English lessons. He had no choice but
                    to accept, since I was working pro bono.</p>
                <p>The next day I received a call from the State Department asking whether I would
                    be interested in a three month special mission to the Philippines. I asked a few
                    questions and replied affirmatively. I had to report to the Bureau of
                    Population, Refugees, and Migration (the old RP) the following day. Little did I
                    realize that the three-month mission would be the beginning of a series of
                    assignments with PRM lasting years. On April 15, 1996, when I showed up in the
                    Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM), Evelyn Whittaker greeted me
                    and told me she had the responsibility for helping me complete my paperwork and
                    making sure I was on the Northwest Air flight to Bangkok two days later. I was
                    to participate in the kick-off workshop in Bangkok for Operation ROVR
                    (Resettlement Opportunities for Vietnamese Returnees). I was pleased Evelyn was
                    handling the administrative formalities since she knew all the shortcuts, as
                    well as the people who gave the approvals. I recognized many people in PRM from
                    my days in RP in 1984-1987. Foremost were Doug Hunter, Judy Chavchavadze, Jim
                    Kelley, Norm Runkles, Terry Rusch, Paula Lynch, and Jim Lawrence. Doug and Judy
                    were instrumental in recommending that I be brought out of retirement and
                    entrusted with heading the mission to the Philippine camp on Palawan Island for
                    rejected Vietnamese asylum seekers. (The Assistant Secretary, Phyllis Oakley,
                    had confidence in Judy and Doug, so my interview with her a few months earlier
                    about future work in PRM took place in a positive atmosphere.) After two hectic
                    days of briefings, I boarded the plane to Bangkok.</p>
                <p>In Bangkok I met up with the other members of the Palawan ROVR team. I was to be
                    supported by a junior consular officer at the Embassy in Manila, Jim Mullinax,
                    and two contract personnel, Babes Katima, a Filipina from our Vietnamese
                    Processing Office in Bangkok, and Phu Dac Ninh, a Vietnamese refugee settled in
                    Canada. Jim spent only a few days on Palawan before returning to Manila. He was
                    to be my link with the Embassy and thus the “outside world.”</p>
                <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                <p>Electronic communications were so irregular and of such poor quality between
                    Palawan and Manila that almost all my messages were delayed and garbled in
                    transmission. The initial telegrams to Washington sent from Embassy Manila with
                    my progress reports read differently from what I wrote on Palawan and faxed to
                    Jim. (When I finally received the come-back copies, weeks later, I asked him
                    about the differences in the two texts. He told me he had given my faxes to his
                    local secretary to be typed into cable format. What she could not read because
                    of the garbles, she reconstructed to the best of her ability! Subsequently, he
                    personally took charge of the transcribing.)</p>
                <p>The refugee camp on Palawan had about 2,000 Vietnamese registered, but since it
                    was an open camp, many were living outside. In fact, they were living on other
                    islands and were engaged in trading. They came back to Palawan occasionally to
                    celebrate Vietnamese holidays or weddings and funerals. Shortly after arriving,
                    we announced the details of the ROVR program. Basically, the program offered a
                    second chance for U.S. resettlement to those persons who had left Vietnam and
                    had been turned down in their request for refugee status by combined UNHCR and
                    national authorities. The USG, in conjunction with the refugee-hosting nations
                    of Southeast Asia, had reached a compromise that promised resettlement in the
                    USA for those refugees (and their immediate families) who had served in the U.S.
                    or Vietnamese military or in the civilian government, provided they returned to
                    Vietnam for processing. The important element was that they did not have to
                    convince the U.S. authorities in Vietnam that they were refugees, but only that
                    they had served in the civil service or the military. There was great skepticism
                    among the refugees about what would happen to them if they returned to Vietnam
                    to await their turn for processing. This is where the ROVR teams played a role.
                    We were to answer questions, encourage the would-be refugees to inquire from
                    family or friends in Vietnam, or to seek advice from the UN High Commission for
                    Refugees (UNHCR), or from other sources.</p>
                <p>While the choice for most of the Vietnamese in Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia,
                    Indonesia, and Thailand was go home voluntarily or under duress, the Vietnamese
                    in the Philippines had a broader choice. They could also opt for resettlement in
                    the Philippines. A group of Philippine Catholic bishops, clerics, and nuns had
                    gone to the United States and had raised sufficient funds to build simple
                    housing for those Vietnamese who wanted to remain on Palawan. With that
                    incentive, there were few takers of the option to return to Vietnam and await
                    processing for the US.</p>
                <pb facs="0181" n="Page0181"/>
                <p>It should be noted that while the Catholic chaplain (an American with decades of
                    service in Southeast Asia) and a Vietnamese nun leaned in some cases toward
                    encouraging the return option, there were several groups of Vietnamese from the
                    U.S. who came to the Palawan camp to denounce the ROVR program. They cited many
                    examples of alleged arrests, persecution, and violence involving Vietnamese who
                    had returned. I noted the particulars and asked Washington for information. The
                    response was quick. These were old allegations. Our Embassy, the UNHCR, several
                    NGOs, and the International Red Cross had investigated the charges, but could
                    not find substantiating evidence. Reading between the lines, it was clear to me
                    that the examples were either made up or exaggerated to serve the purposes of
                    the anti-ROVR groups. After several months on Palawan, I realized I had
                    accomplished whatever was possible under the ROVR program. I returned to
                    Washington on June 10.</p>
                <p>After returning from the Philippines and spending a week being debriefed by
                    various PRM officers, I went on a long vacation with Anike. Before leaving, I
                    was asked by Doug Hunter whether I would be interested in eventually filling in
                    for one of the officers who was expecting a baby and planned to take several
                    months of maternity leave. I very definitely was interested. Her portfolio was
                    the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International
                    Organization for Migration (IOM).</p>
                <p>Before I got very deeply into her work, a crisis erupted in Northern Iraq when
                    some units of Saddam Hussein's army invaded (at the invitation of one of the
                    Kurdish factions) to attack another Kurdish clan. We hastily withdrew most of
                    the Americans working in the region. The White House then made the decision also
                    to withdraw the Kurds (and their families) working for the USG. A civilian
                    airlift was ordered and Operation “Quick Transit” began. A dozen PRM officers
                    spent the weekend trying to arrange through the International Organization for
                    Migration (IOM) for charters of civilian aircraft.</p>
                <p>The officers also began the search for a destination to receive them for
                    processing before they entered the USA. The European Bureau (EUR) and the Near
                    Eastern Bureau (NEA) worked with PRM on the political aspects. No European
                    country wanted to host the Kurds, even temporarily. The solution was to pick
                    them up in a Turkish Air Force base, Diyarbakir, and fly them half way around
                    the world to Andersen Air Force Base on Guam. There they would be processed by
                    the US Immigration and Naturalization Service, and after security checks were
                    completed, they would be flown to the US for resettlement. Our Embassy in Ankara
                    had a hard sell to obtain permission from the Turkish Government for the
                    uninhibited transit of thousands of Kurds from Iraq to Diyarbakir. IOM ran into
                    problems with the first charters, since the aircraft provisionally chartered
                    were not certified by the FAA, and thus could not land at the US Air Force Base
                    on Guam. The PRM officers were unfamiliar with the requirements to obtain
                    over-flight clearances from all the countries between Turkey and Guam. The two
                    Air Force officers in the Department of State's Operations Center were called in
                    on Sunday evening to assist. Operation “Quick Transit” would last for several
                    months, so someone had take charge of the logistics. PRM Assistant Secretary
                    Oakley selected me.</p>
                <pb facs="0182" n="Page0182"/>
                <p>I went to the Department's Operations Center on Monday Morning, September 16,
                    1996, to take charge of the Task Force. I relieved several bedraggled PRMers who
                    had spent much of the past two days attempting to activate the process of
                    extricating from Northern Iraq those Kurds who were U.S. Government employees. I
                    was told that there would be other members of the Task Force from PRM, the Near
                    Eastern (NEA) and European (EUR) Bureaus, from the Office of Foreign Disaster
                    Assistance in the Agency for International Development (AID/OFDA), and from the
                    Consular Affairs Bureau (CA). We were to operate around the clock. For the first
                    several days, a technician from the Ops Center was assigned to our group to help
                    us master the complex communications equipment at our disposal. We could reach
                    Embassy Ankara and the small detachment at Diyarbakir, as well as Andersen AFB
                    with a secure phone. Also we could reach our liaison officers in Northern Iraq
                    with satellite phones, but the messages were not encrypted. We could also hold
                    secure video conferences with all the other players in the USG involved in the
                    operation: FBI, CIA, INS, HHS, DOD, and the NSC. Within a day, the NSC set up a
                    regular video conference at 5 P.M. each day. Eric Schwartz, the NSC Officer for
                    Humanitarian Affairs, chaired the discussions.</p>
                <p>I began to work twelve-hour shifts. I would come in for the last four hours of
                    shift A, work my own shift for eight hours, and the stay for the first four
                    hours of shift C. The team members had little experience in Kurdish affairs,
                    logistics, aircraft charters, etc. It was a learn-by-doing operation. We knew
                    what we were doing was essential to save lives. We were determined to succeed.
                    We were confident that by asking questions from people in and out of the
                    government, we could fill in the many gaps in our knowledge. IOM was of enormous
                    help, particularly Michel Tonneau and his boss, Jorg Stuwe. Those two ran their
                    own task force. We were in communication with them practically round the clock.
                    So that I knew what was happening with IOM and to minimize contradictory
                    instructions, I decided that I would be the prime contact for IOM. That meant I
                    was also on call round the clock.</p>
                <pb facs="0183" n="Page0183"/>
                <p>The initial snafu by IOM with the charters was rectified and the first plane, a
                    charter Boeing 747 from Corsair with 325 Kurdish refugees aboard, landed on Guam
                    on September 17. The Kurds had made their way out of Northern Iraq by car,
                    truck, or on foot to the Turkish border where they were met by Embassy and US
                    military officers and then bussed to Diyarbakir. They were allowed to bring only
                    one suitcase per person. They had to leave their homes, cars, furniture,
                    household pets, etc to be disposed of by friends and relatives. A three-star
                    general of the US Air Force and dozens of US military personnel welcomed them as
                    they deplaned. Before the exhausted Kurds could be taken to their temporary
                    housing, the Guam Customs officers wanted to search all the luggage. After an
                    hour of searches and the clearance of only the first several dozen travelers,
                    the AF General pleaded for some common sense and humanity. Customs relented and
                    did a spot check of every twentieth person. The Kurds were delighted to be
                    halfway to their new homes in America, but were startled to see a huge welcoming
                    sign at the AFB in English and Turkish, the language of the country against
                    which many of their kinsmen were fighting. The need for quick action in leaving
                    Northern Iraq meant that there was great flexibility by the American officers at
                    the border in determining the definition of a “nuclear family.” Our Kurdish
                    employees interpreted the concept quite liberally. Thus they brought with them
                    parents, grandparents, nephews, cousins, and assorted in-laws. Regarding those
                    men with multiple wives, they were advised to list them on the INS entry forms
                    as cousins. In fact, some of them were cousins! Four other chartered aircraft
                    followed. The first phase of “Quick Transit” was completed by September 19. A
                    total of 2,137 Kurds were flown to Guam for processing by the INS and HHS before
                    being transported to their new homes in the United States. Once the four planes
                    landed on Guam, I began to plan for the extrication of the second group, as well
                    as work to resolve problems that came up during the processing of the first
                    tranche. We learned that several members of a family were separated during the
                    move from Northern Iraq. They showed up at the Turkish border several days after
                    the departure of the last aircraft. They were offered shelter by an Embassy
                    officer (on the Iraq side of the border) until they could be flown out in the
                    next tranche. The Kurds on Guam who were USG employees wanted their back pay as
                    well as word on whether they would continue to be paid while on Guam, since they
                    were legally still on the Government payroll. I was able to hand the payroll
                    issue off to AID, the employer of the Kurds. As we began the preparations for
                    the next flights, we had the advantage of additional time and the experience
                    gained from the first phase. I personally took charge of obtaining the flight
                    clearances. The process was more orderly. We did not have the need of
                    telephoning our embassies with frantic requests asking them to plead with their
                    host governments for urgent over-flight clearances. The second tranche of Quick
                    Transit was aimed at extricating some 600 Iraqis who fit in the category of
                    “oppositionists” to the Saddam Hussein regime. These were members of various
                    opposition groups such as the Iraqi National Group, the Iraqi National Accord,
                    and the Iraqi National Congress. This was not a group as well-defined as Quick
                    Transit I. Some were supported directly or indirectly by the American
                    Government; others were known to us, but received no monetary compensation. The
                    White House determined that this group also was in grave danger if a second
                    attack were launched. The order was given to fly them to Guam. Leasing two
                    charter aircraft was relatively simple. The main problem was identifying the
                    right people and assisting them to cross into Turkey and conversely, making sure
                    that people not on our list were spotted.</p>
                <pb facs="0184" n="Page0184"/>
                <p>One unexpected glitch that took hours to resolve and resulted in delaying the
                    first flight by a day was a misunderstanding by the top leadership of the
                    Kurdish Democratic Party as to the timeframe for the departure. As a result, the
                    evacuees were not allowed to cross into Turkey at Habur Gate by the lower-level
                    KDP security forces. It took dozens of telephone calls between the Task Force,
                    New York, London, Ankara, and Northern Iraq to resolve the problem.</p>
                <p>As expected, some people showed up at the border who were not on our list, but
                    had papers and some strong vocal support from other members of the
                    “Oppositionists”. This necessitated calls back and forth between the Ops Center
                    and our people on the border, followed by conference calls in Washington to
                    decide whether to allow them on the plane. Most were rejected because we really
                    did not know who they were or their backgrounds. The Tower Air and Air Outre Mer
                    charters took off from Incirlik Air Force Base (instead of Diyarbakir because of
                    dust problems at the latter). They landed on Guam the night of October 23, with
                    a total of 601 “Oppositionists.” Quick Transit II was successfully
                    concluded.</p>
                <p>The CIA arranged a separate flight after the close of QT-II to take out a special
                    group of people. Some of the CIA assets were included in Quick Transit II, but
                    not all. My task force was not asked for direct assistance.</p>
                <pb facs="0185" n="Page0185"/>
                <p>Attention was now focused on the most contentious issue, whether the USG should
                    evacuate the Kurds working for American NGOs or for USG-funded European NGOs.
                    The Department was ambivalent about recommending such an evacuation. Saddam's
                    forces had not re-entered Northern Iraq since the first thrust in September. Of
                    course, no one in the USG would state that the security situation would likely
                    remain stable. While the NGOs were lobbying hard for an evacuation, there was,
                    nevertheless, the realization that if the locally-hired Kurds departed the
                    country, most of the services provided by the NGOs to the population would
                    diminish or disappear. The United Nations personnel and most of the European
                    NGOs did not plan to leave unless conditions changed. In the end, the White
                    House decided in the affirmative to move out the Kurds working for American NGOs
                    or USG-funded European entities. (It was election time!) We, therefore, prepared
                    for Quick Transit III. This phase turned out to be the most difficult. One of
                    the tasks that had to be completed before movements out of Northern Iraq to the
                    Turkish border began was the identification and security clearance of the
                    potential evacuees. Unlike the two earlier phases, where there was reasonably
                    complete data (full name, date and place of birth, family members, etc.) on the
                    principal “anchor” member of the family group (USG employee or identified
                    “oppositionist”), the NGOs did not have similar data on their employees. Also
                    there was a dispute about whether part-time or contract employees of the NGOs
                    should be included. Since the USG had not previously vetted the NGO employees on
                    security grounds, basic background checks were ordered. Before the security
                    checks could begin, the NGOs had to obtain the personal data. Since the American
                    NGO field reps had been evacuated from Northern Iraq, there were doubts about
                    the accuracy of the data being gathered on the Kurdish employees by other Kurds
                    and third-country nationals. There were many rumors of NGO employees “selling”
                    their identities to other Kurds desirous of being resettled in the US.
                    Eventually we got the lists from the NGOs of their employees and their families
                    and turned them over to the CIA and FBI for security checks. We were also
                    receiving reports almost daily from our intelligence agencies, from Kurds, or
                    from other sources that employee X, Y, or Z was an agent of Iraq's intelligence
                    service or that employee A, B, or C had committed murder, rape, or some other
                    heinous crime. None of the accusations could be verified, so the decision by the
                    NSC was to evacuate the persons and conduct in-depth interviews on Guam during
                    the processing for U.S. resettlement.</p>
                <p>On December 2, 1996, the Quick Transit III Task Force formally started operating
                    in the Ops Center. (We had been working out of PRM since the last flights.)
                    American Field Liaison Teams were in Northern Iraq to assist and prioritize the
                    movements of the evacuees to and through the border at Habur Gate. Chartered
                    busses were to take them to the airport at Batman (instead of Diyarbakir). IOM
                    had chartered fourteen flights, with the first to depart on December 6.</p>
                <pb facs="0186" n="Page0186"/>
                <p>It was not an easy task for our team on the ground at the Turkish border crossing
                    point of Habur Gate to identify and process (preliminarily) the streams of Kurds
                    coming out of Northern Iraq and bus them to the Batman field. The team made life
                    easier for us in the Ops Center by making most of the decisions on its own and
                    referring only the policy issues to Washington. There were attempts by Kurds
                    using false documents to bring along distant adult relatives or friends as
                    family members. Some were detected. The Americans were aided by Kurdish
                    officials to check the authenticity of documents. With the concurrence of our
                    Ambassador to Turkey, Marc Grossman, if adults in a family group were discovered
                    with forged papers in an attempt to be included, the entire family was struck
                    off the list for evacuation. It was a draconian measure, but it seemed to be
                    effective as soon as the word got out. Since the original lists submitted to
                    Washington by the NGOs did not include the names and dates of birth of infants,
                    there were some confusion and delays at the border as the team amended the
                    official lists. There was concern that some of the infants were probably
                    nephews, nieces, and cousins of the principals, but there was little that could
                    be done short of DNA tests to disprove the relationships. None of the infants
                    had papers from the Kurdish authorities.</p>
                <p>Other problems were the refusal of the Kurdish authorities to allow the departure
                    from Northern Iraq of some dozen physicians working for the NGOs; whether to
                    evacuate former NGO employees; and what to do with stragglers from an NGO who
                    arrived at Habur Gate after the departure of the NGO head (who could identify
                    them). There was also the question about how many planes would actually be
                    needed. With the doctors, the decision went around and around. Washington, the
                    field team, and Dahuk (the administrative center for the Kurdish authorities)
                    discussed the issue. Most of the doctors were eventually allowed to leave. On
                    the employees who formerly worked with the NGOs, some were identified by NGO
                    heads at the border and urgent clearance requests were made to Washington. They
                    also boarded. Most of the stragglers were finally accepted after the NGO heads
                    were located and urged to return to the border to identify their employees. The
                    first plane departed on schedule on December 6 with 340 passengers. Because the
                    number of evacuees was less than the NGOs had anticipated, IOM canceled
                    contracts for several planes (and the USG paid the required financial
                    penalties). The last flight (number eleven) arrived at Andersen AFB on Guam on
                    December 15. 3,780 persons were evacuated in QT-III. That made an overall total
                    of about 6,520 over the three-month period.</p>
                <pb facs="0187" n="Page0187"/>
                <p>I was delighted and greatly relieved with the successful completion of the Quick
                    Transit exercise. When I was suddenly asked by A/S Oakley to take over the PRM
                    Task Force, I was out of touch with many of the recent developments in the
                    Department and in PRM. Also, I no longer had the personal contacts throughout
                    the building and in the other agencies that are so necessary to do the work
                    involved with a task force. I succeeded in the assignment because of my prior
                    experience, the ability to think through the problems as they arose, and the
                    willingness to work twelve-hour days to make sure we were covering all the
                    bases. I recall mentioning to Doug Hunter toward the very end of the exercise
                    that I was just becoming comfortable with the task assigned to me, since so many
                    aspects of the job were entirely new or quite different from previous
                    experiences. He replied that was the reason I was chosen. No one in the Bureau
                    had first-hand knowledge of all the tasks required for the job, and so the
                    decision was made to choose the person with the broadest Foreign Service career.
                    That was me.</p>
                <p>I stayed on in PRM after QT. There were always more than enough refugee crises,
                    maternity leaves, TDYs, resignations, high-level visits, and gaps between
                    assignments to keep me busy and in high demand. I worked almost exclusively in
                    the Office for Multilateral Coordination and External Relations headed by Doug
                    Hunter. My portfolio was largely the Red Cross Movement (the International
                    Committee of the Red Cross, the International Federation of the Red Cross/Red
                    Crescent, and the American Red Cross). My supervisor was Nick Miscione. He had
                    served for years overseas in refugee camps with various NGOs. He came into the
                    Department several years earlier.</p>
                <p>The Department's relationship with the American Red Cross normally required only
                    occasional attention from our office. The Secretary of State was ex officio a
                    member of the Board of Governors by virtue of a Presidential appointment. Four
                    times a year we prepared briefing papers for the Secretary or his/her designated
                    representative, usually the latter, to participate in the meetings. Except for
                    the activities of the International Services Committee, the Board spent most of
                    its time on domestic issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0188" n="Page0188"/>
                <p>The relationship between the Department and the American Red Cross changed after
                    Dr. Bernadine Healy was chosen to fill the position of President and CEO vacated
                    by Elizabeth Dole. Dr. Healy publicly attacked the exclusion of the Israeli
                    National Society, the Magen David Adom (MDA), from the International Red
                    Cross/Red Crescent Movement. The reason for the exclusion was the wording of the
                    Geneva Conventions, which stipulated that the only recognized symbols of
                    national societies were a red cross or red crescent. The Star of David was not
                    mentioned. The Red Cross Movement was acting to amend the Geneva Conventions to
                    include a third symbol, a red circle, diamond, or square, for optional use by
                    the Israeli National Society. Healy's attack accused the Movement of
                    anti-Semitism. The U.S. press took up her attack and was soon joined by
                    Congress. Our role was to explain what the ICRC and the IFRC were doing to
                    facilitate the entry of the MDA into the Red Cross Movement and to refute the
                    unjust and unwarranted accusation of anti-Semitism. The bottleneck in amending
                    the Geneva Conventions to make the admission of MDA possible was not the Red
                    Cross Movement, but many Arab or Muslim states.</p>
                <p>The Movement had a detailed plan to amend the Conventions and had successfully
                    negotiated the preliminary steps leading to an international diplomatic
                    conference scheduled for November 2000 to complete the process. The renewal of
                    hostilities in the Middle East in October of 2000 made further negotiations on
                    the issue futile. The ARC Board sacked Healy in late 2001, but the MDA issue had
                    taken on a life of its own.</p>
                <p>Congress had included a paragraph in the Department's budget authorization
                    requiring the Secretary to certify that the MDA was not being denied
                    “participation” in the Red Cross Movement. We could prepare a certification
                    document for the Secretary's signature because the Movement had frequently taken
                    that extra step to include the MDA in many of its activities.</p>
                <p>Other notable Red Cross activity I was engaged in was the 1999 International Red
                    Cross Conference. This gathering is held every four years and brings together
                    all the national societies and the governments signatory to the Geneva
                    Conventions of 1949. Heading the US Government delegation was retired Chairman
                    of the Joint Chiefs, General Shalikashvili. He was an ideal choice for the
                    mission. The idea came from our Assistant Secretary Julia Taft. She had worked
                    with him a few years earlier on humanitarian issues.</p>

                <p>I was his contact and assistant during the last two weeks of preparations in
                    Washington for the RC Conference. “Shali” is how he wanted to be addressed. He
                    was such a delight. He asked very little from me in the way of care and
                    maintenance. We used the time together in taxis and between meetings to discuss
                    so many issues other than the Conference. He was teaching a seminar at Stanford
                    University on international relations for the first time, and when he heard that
                    I had taught diplomatic history and international relations for two years at St.
                    Meinrad College, he asked me how the students and I interacted. Shali recognized
                    that we shared a wealth of experience in the international area, but were novice
                    teachers. He was interested in discussing how practitioners of international
                    relations could better convey their knowledge to a younger audience with a
                    minimum of personal experience in the field.</p>
                <p>He carefully studied his briefing books and took an active role in formulating
                    our policy positions. There were initial disagreements between State and DOD on
                    issues, but Shali helped bridge many of the gaps. (In the end, however, it was
                    Doug Hunter who reconciled the outstanding differences in Washington, and then
                    played a key role on the USG delegation in the drafting sessions at the
                    Conference to negotiate acceptable language for the final documents.) I remained
                    in Washington as the backup to the delegation during the Conference.</p>
                <p>Working again on the Red Cross portfolio in PRM has been one of the most
                    rewarding and positive assignments in my career. (When I was in Geneva, I was
                    responsible for liaison with the Red Cross for two years.) From observing the
                    ICRC staff in the field during my years in Africa and at the Headquarters in
                    Geneva, I developed a deep admiration for them and their organization. I am
                    proud of the long and close relationship between the United States and the
                    International Committee of the Red Cross.</p>
                <p>On that note, I will end my narrative account of my career idiplomacy.</p>
