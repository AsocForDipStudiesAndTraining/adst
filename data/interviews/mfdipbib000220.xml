                <p>Interviewed by: G. Lewis Schmidt </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: January 31, 1989</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Cohrssen has a very interesting background, and I
                        would like to ask him to begin this interview by giving a brief summary of
                        that background, including his birth in Germany, what brought him to the
                        United States in the first place, and from there on, what he did before he
                        got into the Information Service. Then I'd like to have him give a brief
                        sketch of his career there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Biosketch: Early Years in Germany: Emigration to US 1926</p>
                <p>COHRSSEN: I was born in Germany in 1905. My training was as a businessman. I had
                    an apprenticeship in the wholesale metals business, and I became active in the
                    political situation about 1924 when there was a referendum on expropriating the
                    former Kaiser and the King of Bavaria, of their property, because they had
                    gotten the world into the first world war. It was a complete flop. I formed a
                    sort of non-partisan committee in Mannheim, where I lived, and organized a mass
                    meeting, but in the end I found myself alone with the communists as partners,
                    with whom I had no truck whatever. All the other parties had checked out. The
                    experience made me feel I couldn't live in that country.</p>
                <p>So I emigrated. I had the good fortune of having second cousins of my mother in
                    Philadelphia. I left January, 1926 on my 21st birthday for Philadelphia and
                    there took the usual odd jobs you have to take to keep going. I worked in Lipp's
                    Department Store framing mirrors and pictures. I packed china at Wanamakers
                    during the Christmas season. Then I sold brushes from door to door in
                    Philadelphia, particularly in the suburbs.</p>
                <p>Survival in US: Onset of Depression</p>
                <p>New York. After a week, he fired me. I think he had then some businessman who
                    imported Czech jewelry hired me to work for him in gotten me to New York to get
                    me away from his fianc�e.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>I went back to selling Fuller brushes in New York for a few years. There I met
                    many ex-Germans, young people who, like myself, had become vegetarians. With two
                    of them I bought the Vita Health Food Company in Washington in 1928, a health
                    food store, one of the first in the country. But I checked out about a couple of
                    years later because of personal differences, went back to New York, driving a
                    taxi cab, running a health food store, and doing all sorts of things.</p>
                <p>After a visit to Germany in 1930 to see my parents, I decided I was going to live
                    more or less permanently in this country. I told my father so. He didn't see it
                    at all. He wanted to set me up in business. I returned to New York in March
                    1931. It took some time before I got my footing again.</p>
                <p>Cohrssen Decides to Become an Economist: Long Association with Yale University
                    Professor Irving Fisher</p>
                <p>In the meantime, the Depression had started and I decided I was going to be an
                    economist, helping to fight the Depression. I got in touch with the Stable Money
                    Association, which was close to the ideas which we promulgated. “We” meant a
                    group of young Europeans, Germans and Swiss, who were proponents of the Silvio
                    Gesell ideas of economic reform, meaning particularly monetary reform and
                    monetary stability.</p>
                <p>That's how in 1932 I met Irving Fisher, a Yale professor, who was very active at
                    that time fighting the Depression. He was interested in our ideas of issuing
                    stamp scrip, as a means of employing the unemployed, alleviating the need in the
                    communities. At first he asked me to help him answer his correspondence with
                    communities that wanted to issue stamp scrip. Then we wrote a little handbook on
                    the issue of stamp scrip. But then Roosevelt, as he got into power, stopped
                    this. He had closed the banks. He didn't allow the issuance of emergency money.
                    Fisher kept me on to do the research on a book called Stable Money, and put my
                    name on the title page with his. I worked with him for ten years in various
                    capacities, visiting Europe twice to study monetary and economic conditions.</p>
                <p>In 1942, I went to work at Business Week magazine as special assistant to the
                    publisher. After a year of that, I became the economist of the Institute of Life
                    Insurance.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, the war had broken out and I became aware of the fact that maybe
                    I should contribute to the Allied cause. My people in Europe were suffering and
                    so many had died.</p>
                <p>1931 Hitler's Accession to Power Persuaded Cohrssen to Obtain American
                    Citizenship</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time, I gather you had become an American citizen.
                        Would you briefly go back and cover that, then take it from there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>COHRSSEN: The day after Hitler had gotten into power on January 30, 1933, I went
                    down to the courthouse and applied for American citizenship. I wrote my parents,
                    “Get out of Germany.” They were Jewish, but they wouldn't listen. My father had
                    become a very strong supporter of German democracy, and he still thought there
                    was a chance of fighting dictatorship.</p>
                <p>1942: Joins Wartime Information Services: Service in North Africa, Italy, and
                    Finally (1945) Austria</p>
                <p>Well, in 1943, I joined the US Information Services Psychological Warfare, was
                    shipped overseas, first to West Africa and then to Italy, to Rome, where I
                    worked as liaison between propaganda and economics, which meant visiting places
                    of destruction and furnishing the basic information for the photographers and
                    the press people who wrote it up, trying to promote economic recovery at the
                    base.</p>
                <p>The Building of Austrian Radio - Ultimately Known as the Red-White Network, in
                    Salzburg</p>
                <p>Toward the war's end, I was sent up north to Milan to control the German language
                    program of control on Radio Milano. That didn't last long because the war was
                    over. And chiefly because I knew German, and then they said, I had some radio
                    experience now, I was made Chief of Programming of the non-existent Austrian
                    Radio in the American sector of Austria. Well, on June 6, 1945 we started our
                    program from Salzburg, with a speech by the general, news and music. In Rome, I
                    had met Denise Abbey, an excellent secretary, who agreed to come along with me.
                    She was of tremendous help to me. There was also one more American, a young man,
                    who had worked with NBC in this country. Offices and studios were built for us
                    by the Army in a Franciscan monastery. From my office I had views of St. Francis
                    Church, the Salzburg Castle, and the Cathedral.</p>
                <p>In a matter of three months, we had nine hours of programming. Our first studio
                    was in a dressing room of the local theater. Our live music was the harmonica of
                    one of our studio engineers. So we had news and harmonica music. Our other music
                    came from the collection of records that had belonged to the Prince Eugene
                    Propaganda Train of the Nazis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: May I interrupt at this point to ask you a question? In
                        the broadcast of news, were you trying to carry any political content, or
                        were you just giving news as it developed, without any kind of interpretive
                        comment whatsoever?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>COHRSSEN: We had practically no comment, our only commentary was practically the
                    Voice of America, which was broadcast once a day. It was direct from the United
                    States. We did develop a commentary program which consisted of the views of
                    others. We monitored Radio Moscow, Radio France, and the BBC, so we knew what
                    these people were saying. Our news department was actually very efficient. The
                    BBC quoted us on one or two occasions, “as we learned through Radio
                    Rot-Weiss-Rot in Salzburg.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask if your station became part of the
                        Austrian Red-White-Red network.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHRSSEN: We were the network, with stations in Salzburg, Linz and Vienna. The
                    name was invented by an American, and our broadcast signal was “Oh Du Mein
                    Oesterreich” from a popular song. We gathered an unusual group of talent around
                    us, Austrians who had fled Vienna from the Russians. There had been a group of
                    Austrians who had set up radio in Bad Aussie, called it the Freedom station. It
                    was underground at first, and became the collecting point of radio people from
                    Vienna, most of whom then came to us. So we got people like Axel Steinbrecher,
                    who was a splendid musician. He had written a lot of the popular songs. We had a
                    man by the name of Schoenwiese, a leading literary man, who published a literary
                    magazine. He just celebrated his 80th birthday.</p>
                <p>We had two men whom I selected as my special assistants. I picked them up in
                    Rome. One was Jerry Wilk, who became more or less my deputy for the cultural
                    features, a lawyer from Berlin, the other one was Eric Mamerow, a journalist
                    from Berlin. Eric put order into our news department. I had started by writing
                    the news myself. It was fascinating to do something I'd never done in my life,
                    and do it before the experts came. [Chuckles] Anyway, he set up a terrific news
                    department, which measured up to that of any other European station. He had been
                    a German newspaper correspondent who had fled Hitler to France, was caught by
                    the Germans and put in their so-called punitive battalion into North Africa,
                    which was then caught by the British, and they put these people to work. I met
                    another man in Algiers, Jean-Louis H�barre, who had been with the same
                    battalion. He became a press officer for the French. He was instrumental in
                    setting up German radio in the Sector occupied by the French.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>So we had excellent news. We also had a German newspaperman, Paul Becker,
                    interested in scientific and cultural affairs. He ran that department and he
                    later became the director of the station after it had been turned over to the
                    Austrians. Our music department obtained the records and sheet music of the
                    Sankt Florian Library, where the composer Bruckner had worked. It was a
                    wonderful collection to produce good music programs. The man who kept stock of
                    our records was an Austrian expert who had done the same thing in Vienna for the
                    Austrian Radio. We soon had an efficient and highly productive organization, and
                    the crowd of people who sat together in the morning to discuss current affairs
                    and twice or three times a week to discuss longer-term program plans came up
                    with many brilliant and original ideas. It was a very creative bunch. The
                    atmosphere in that newly liberated country was something you simply can't
                    imagine. It's like being at a wedding all the time. It's like creating the world
                    anew. These people worked hard and took all sorts of hardships upon
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to interpose a question at that point. As you
                        well know, there was a very strong Nazi influence in Austria at the time of
                        the Anschluss. And, I gather, through a good portion of the German
                        occupation there were Austrian Nazis. These people whom you had access to
                        presumably had not had any taint of Naziism, but did you find any indication
                        of Nazi sympathies when you were in Austria in the early stages of the
                        occupation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHRSSEN: I had nothing to do with the clearing of these people. They all had to
                    pass scrutiny by the CIC, Counterintelligence Corps, and if they came with a
                    paper saying that they were cleared, there was supposedly no problem. I found in
                    two cases I had been deceived. One case was a man interested in philosophy who
                    had come from Innsbruck and ran this type of program. One day he was arrested
                    and thrown into prison. By sheer stupidity, he had told someone that Vienna
                    would be turned over to the Russians without a fight, and it caused bloodshed.
                    He was found innocent and resumed his career.</p>
                <p>The other person, wrote me after I had left Austria two or three years later, “I
                    was a Nazi and they found out, but in the meantime, I've proven myself as a true
                    democrat, and have done valuable work for Rot-Weiss-Rot. Wouldn't you give me a
                    paper to help me clear my record?” I wrote him back. “I can't change your past
                    and you lied to me. So you have to live with your conscience. I am not going to
                    do anything for you.” I found out he had been a member of a theater-ensemble and
                    had denounced a colleague as being Jewish, who was thrown into a concentration
                    camp where he died. What shocked me was that my Austrian friends on our staff
                    knew about it, and never told me. That man later became very successful in the
                    musical field in Salzburg, but I suppose there were many like that who got away
                    with it.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>But on the whole, the people I had to work with were too much involved in
                    building a new Austria, and that was the general tendency, and that's what got
                    me into trouble with my American colleagues, because they considered our station
                    chiefly as a means of the American Government to impose its policies upon the
                    Austrian people. Now, being on the ground, you have a different perspective. You
                    see what sufferings and injustice they had gone through. Austria had a great
                    cultural tradition and, before the Nazis took over, much artistic and
                    intellectual freedom, and they felt they knew about as much or more than we
                    Americans did when it came to Austrian affairs. After the war, with
                    anti-Semitism eliminated, and the country free of the Nazi influence, you had
                    about the same structure of society that you find in any free country. There was
                    an active group of intellectuals, a self-respective middle class, all of them
                    full of good will and the desire to do the right thing. Of course, there will
                    always be unreconstructed rebels in any society, of the Nazi type or some other
                    type. We had to contend with that.</p>
                <p>What we tried to do was to emulate an American type of radio program. I
                    introduced a town hall meeting of the air. That was quite interesting, because
                    when I first discussed this with the acting governor of Land Salzburg, he said,
                    “Well, Mr. Cohrssen, you won't be able to do that for ten years. Our people
                    aren't ripe for this sort of free discussion. They don't know how to do
                    that.”</p>
                <p>We had the first such meeting a few months later in our big studio. There was
                    room for an audience of 350, but only one person came, one local person. There
                    were a dozen people, members of our staff and friends. Our moderator was Louis
                    Bauer, who later became the boss of Austrian Petroleum, a very charming man. I
                    think it was about education, how we should go about to re-educating the
                    Austrians. Louis would say, “Well, the lady over there in the corner.” It was
                    actually a woman who was sitting next to him. And there was this one man from
                    the community, he spoke up and made very intelligent remarks. We concluded the
                    program after a half an hour, and felt it was a success for the first time. But
                    then that one man who constituted our audience came up to me and said, “Mr.
                    Cohrssen, I'm afraid you can't use that.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Why not?”</p>
                <p>“Because I was a prominent Nazi in this community and everybody knows my voice.
                    You can't overlook that.” So we had to throw our tape away.</p>
                <p>The second time, there were about a couple of dozen people in the audience. The
                    third time, the studio was packed, and we had a very heated discussion. I think
                    we discussed the problem of housing, finding shelter for people in a community
                    with thousands of refugees. So many people had come to Salzburg from other
                    countries and didn't know where to live. The local population was very critical
                    of the government in Vienna. Well, as a result the Austrian government in Vienna
                    complained that we were undermining its authority.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>We tried numerous ways to promote free expression. We invited people to round
                    table discussions on different questions, including religious and scientific
                    matters. It became a regular program.</p>
                <p>The problem was that while I was trying to establish an Austrian radio operated
                    on American principles, some of my colleagues, the American staff that ran the
                    department from Vienna, felt I was not doing enough to promote America. I wasn't
                    of that opinion. Among other texts I translated the Gettysburg Address. We
                    introduced the American literature that had been banned. But I felt that the
                    Voice of America was too propagandistic, and our audience, having been subjected
                    to German propaganda for years, resented the American propaganda line even
                    though they agreed with the ideals we were trying to sell them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHRSSEN: This was 1945-46, the year after the war. So I placed the American
                    broadcast, the Voice of America, later in the evening though it was supposed to
                    be used in prime time. Thus, I was considered an enemy of the Voice of America.
                    I wrote several memoranda to induce its writers to be more informative and use
                    less rhetoric. We had some discussions about it at our Vienna headquarters, and
                    I believe my point of view prevailed. In any event, they let me run the program
                    the way I wanted.</p>
                <p>Controversy Over Program Written by Young US Citizens of Austrian Birth
                    Assaulting the Catholic Church</p>
                <p>I had one big controversy at headquarters, with this young American who was with
                    me in the beginning. He participated in the production of a program called “We
                    Learn How to Think.” He and a few literary persons dug up old German
                    revolutionary poetry from after the First World War. As that program was handled
                    by an American, it was not censored. When I heard the second of these broadcasts
                    I was shocked, because it was an attack on the church. This revolutionary German
                    literature accused the priests for having supported our unjust war. I felt I had
                    to stop this, because we had not come to undermine the authority of the
                    church.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pardon me. This was the young American whom you had
                        brought up with you that was doing this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHRSSEN: He was assigned to me. During the war he was voicing propaganda by loud
                    speaker across the lines. He was an American citizen of Austrian origin who had
                    emigrated and had worked in broadcasting. I think he was with NBC. He was an
                    expert. That's why he came to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have answered my question. I was going to say if he
                        was an American, did he know enough German to do this, or how did he
                        know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHRSSEN: Oh, no, he was Austrian born, highly intelligent, but heavily
                    influenced by the leftist ideology. So I said, “You're not going to do this. We
                    don't want to alienate the local citizens. We can't affront the clergy. Most of
                    these people have been victims of the Nazis. It's a political question. I don't
                    want that in the program.”</p>
                <p>So he went to headquarters, and I was called down to Vienna. We had it out before
                    the general. The young man said I had no experience, was unfit for the job, and
                    should do something else; and the Austrians had to be re-educated. It was the
                    line that actually came out of Washington: that every Austrian was a Nazi and
                    you had to teach him how to think. I wasn't of that opinion. These were highly
                    cultured people and all they needed was a voice to express their own cultured
                    views.</p>
                <p>Anyway, in the future, he had to submit his programs to my scrutiny before they
                    went out. The next week he sure kept me waiting. The broadcast was scheduled at
                    7:00 P.M. At 6:00 o'clock, he threw his manuscript on my desk. I had to cut out
                    certain lines, which caused a problem with the artists, who had already
                    rehearsed the program. But that was the only time when I had a real problem, and
                    that was very much in the beginning, as early as November/December 1945.</p>
                <p>An Early Post-War Move to Eliminate Red White Red Network and Retain Only the
                    Radio in Vienna - Which was Russian Controlled - was Defeated</p>
                <p>Some of my superiors in Vienna intended to give up Salzburg as an independent
                    station, because I believe they had been influenced by the Russians. In fact,
                    one of our leading men bet me a bottle of champagne that by the first of January
                    1946, there wouldn't be any Rot-Weiss-Rot anymore, that henceforth, it would all
                    go back to the RAVAG, the central radio station in Vienna, the way it had been
                    before.</p>
                <p>But RAVAG was controlled by the Russians. I resisted this attempt of abandoning
                    Rot-Weiss-Rot. I even threatened to write Congress to have this stopped. It
                    never happened and I never got my champagne. On the other hand, I had very good
                    relations with my Russian counterpart, a Major Goldenberg, who was the
                    controller of their program in Vienna. I visited him and I found out that his
                    mother and brothers were living in the States, and I became his means of
                    corresponding with them. So naturally, he was very cooperative.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>We created a common program, which was, I think, unique. It was called the “Voice
                    of the Allies”, one hour a week, where each of the Allies had 15 minutes: 15
                    minutes each of French, British, Russian, and American programs. The hour was
                    broadcast in all four occupation sectors of Austria. The Russians talked only
                    about the democracy and freedom enjoyed by their workers and how satisfied they
                    all were to be able to live under communism. The British talked a lot about
                    university life and sports and activities of that sort. The French talked about
                    their culture. I wrote our program called “America As It Is Not Known,”: It
                    dealt with Sunday in America; how you buy in America; about American county
                    fairs, that is, impressions of America that I had experienced myself. There were
                    only six minutes of talk and nine minutes of music, and it went over big.</p>
                <p>That was one example of how our radio contributed to a better understanding of
                    America in all four sectors of occupied Austria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if your Russian colleague, or counterpart, had
                        any difficulty with his own people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHRSSEN: I don't think so. Once we invited him and his technical colleague for a
                    party, to Salzburg. We took them to the local operetta, and then had some
                    Russian emigres sing old folk songs. They were very sentimental, it was highly
                    successful. After he had had quite a lot of whiskey, he put his arms around me,
                    a huge man, and I'm rather small, and he said, “Look here, Hans. You're fine,
                    but you ought to have more democracy.”</p>
                <p>I said, “You ought to have more freedom.” We've always remained on good
                    terms.</p>
                <p>Russians Attempt to Create a Revolution in Austrian Russian Sector During First
                    Year of Occupation Using Vienna Radio to Support their Scheme. Attempt
                    Thwarted.</p>
                <p>But I found out later the way the Russians operated. If you'll allow me, I'll
                    tell you a personal experience on this. The Russians tried to create a
                    revolution during that first year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean in Austria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHRSSEN: Within their own sector, where they had appointed only communists as
                    mayors of the communities. All officials were appointed by the Russians with the
                    exception of the police, which was under the direction of the Austrian Ministry
                    of the Interior. They were independent of the Russians. There were many cases
                    where they arrested policemen for insubordination and sent them to Siberia. I've
                    talked to many provincial people who told me of their struggles with their local
                    communists who were supported by the Russian military. But the communists
                    remained a small minority party.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>So one day the Russians announced that the workers were taking over the
                    factories, because there was danger that the country was becoming capitalistic
                    again, and they were going to prevent that. While they made this announcement,
                    they even attempted to take over the government of Austria. The Press Secretary
                    of the Austrian Chancellor—he later became my brother-in-law—told me that a
                    group of people stormed into their offices at the Bauhaus Plat. Fortunately, the
                    Austrian guards could lock the doors behind them, and they were caught inside.
                    There were not enough of them inside to cause any damage. It turned out that one
                    of the men caught was a Russian colonel who had put on old civilian clothes. He
                    and his men were going to arrest the Chancellor, and announce to the country
                    that the government had been taken over by the working people. The radio
                    stations controlled by the Russians announced that this was the day that
                    everybody had been waiting for: such and such factory had been taken over by its
                    workers, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this the Russian station in Vienna that was announcing
                        this “news”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHRSSEN: It was the Austrian RAVAG station under Russian control. I talked with
                    the people who were running that station. They told me: “We listened to those
                    announcements, and then we put our own man on the air to state that this had
                    been the news as handed down by the Russian occupation forces. Then we broadcast
                    the Austrian news as we do every day. Now the Russians broke into our office and
                    said, “You're going to go to Siberia for that.” We told them we'd been under
                    this threat from the beginning, but nobody was going to change our attitude.</p>
                <p>I believe that the Russians left Austria in part because of this general attitude
                    on the part of the Austrians. The Russians had learned they could not subjugate
                    these people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very interesting, because last week I was down in
                        Florida and I interviewed a gentleman by the name of Al Puhan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHRSSEN: I met him. Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. He was at that time not a senior officer; he was a
                        middle-grade officer. He was German-born, but he had become an American
                        citizen, and although only a middle-grade political officer in the embassy,
                        was very close to the ambassador at that time. We talked briefly about the
                        Soviets leaving Austria. I said, “What do you think caused the Soviets to
                        give up the idea of staying in Austria and deciding to leave and to execute
                        a peace treaty with Austrian neutrality as long as Austrians would accept
                        the neutrality?” And he said he really didn't know what the reasons were. I
                        won't go into all of his explanations. He gave two or three possibilities,
                        one of which was very close to what you've just said. I'm interested to have
                        you corroborate that feeling.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>COHRSSEN: I've met Al Puhan. He may have been closer to the people in Germany
                    than I was. I don't know. I found out about the Austrian attitudes not only at
                    that time, but later on, because I married into an old Austrian family. My
                    father-in-law, who was the highest civil servant of Lower Austria, went into
                    hiding when the Nazis took over and saved his life. The family suffered a great
                    deal. They were upstanding Austrians who had no truck with the Nazis. Austrian
                    history has been misinterpreted in this country, particularly, by the American
                    Jewish Congress. I can say that because I'm Jewish born myself. It's a
                    ridiculous attitude. It's created a great deal of ill will on both sides, which
                    is unnecessary. There were Nazis. Hitler was an Austrian. But Chancellor
                    Dollfuss tried to stop Hitlerism. He said, “The only effective way to fight
                    these Nazis is to use their methods. If we continue to let them terrorize us,
                    they will force us into a new society.” So he set up a fascist type of
                    government, as the only way of controlling this brutal force. It's just like
                    saying you have to be a good Democrat and find the drug trade taking over the
                    country. You've got to stop it by force or you're not going to do it at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the chancellor. Was this Dollfuss?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHRSSEN: Yes. Dollfuss was murdered by the Hitlerites. Schuschnigg, his
                    successor, was weaker, but he still tried to maintain law and order at the time.
                    When a minority becomes rampant, what are you going to do? The reason Hitler
                    marched into Austria in 1938 was because there was going to be a plebiscite on
                    the question: Will the Austrian people join the German Reich? There was much
                    Nazi propaganda for the so-called Anschluss. So the government was going to let
                    the people decide. Hitler marched in before that could take place, because he
                    knew two-thirds would vote against him. This is a fact that is generally ignored
                    by the American press. Perhaps it has been mentioned. But the American attitude
                    seems due to the fact that the president of Austria, [Kurt] Waldheim, is not
                    particularly well-liked. If he hadn't been under such attacks from America, he
                    would have had much less sympathy in Austria than he has now. He is not
                    considered a Nazi; he's a politician with a weak personality. You have plenty of
                    those in this country. You have them in every country. I mean, it's
                    ridiculous.</p>
                <p>To go back to my story. That attempt at revolution failed, and there were other
                    attempts. Figl, who was at that time the Chancellor of Austria, was hosting the
                    Russian general in charge. When he told the general that this wasn't the way to
                    do things in Austria, that he would never be able to subjugate the people, the
                    Russian said, “I'm going to have you sent to Siberia for that.”</p>
                <p>Cohrssen Ultimately has Disagreement with American Headquarters in Vienna Because
                    he Believed VOA Programs to Austria were too Hard-Line Propagandistic and US
                    Headquarters was Pushing Similar Programs over Red-White-Red. He is
                    Dismissed.</p>
                <p>He replied, “You can't threaten me with this. I've been to Dachau the past three
                    years. And every other member of my cabinet is prepared to go to Siberia.”</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>I think it had a great deal to do with the decision of using Austria as a sort of
                    buffer state between Russia and the West. I think it was that kind of spirit
                    that we were confronted with also in trying to subject them to American
                    propaganda. They wouldn't take it. They said, “We've had enough of that sort of
                    thing.”</p>
                <p>And this was an attitude I fought against in memoranda to my superiors, and that
                    was, I think, the cause, why I was thrown out rather ungraciously. After 30
                    months overseas, I decided I was going to go home to my family and have the
                    usual vacation. We all had worked rather hard. So I was given time off and got
                    very wonderful letters from my superiors in Vienna. The general wrote how much
                    he appreciated what I had done, and would I come back safely. It was completely
                    false, because I hadn't arrived at the Salzburg airport that morning, the first
                    of April 1946, when they had my replacement there. I was told everybody knew
                    that I wasn't coming back. Everybody but me.</p>
                <p>When I went to Washington, after three months at home, to find out when I was
                    going back, Hans Speier of the State Department who had visited Salzburg, told
                    me, “You're not going back because look here.” There was a cable from Vienna.
                    “Ever since Cohrssen's left, there is such harmony in the place. We would be
                    relieved not to have him come back. The program has improved.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you say the cable was from Ted Kaghan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHRSSEN: No, I think it was from Van Erden. But it was an official statement.
                    Van Erden, I think, was the man in charge. Kaghan was the one responsible for
                    radio. I have a personal letter from Kaghan about the work I'd done. “I wish I
                    could go back to the States and say I've accomplished as much for my country as
                    you did, dear Hans,” and this kind of business. But it was completely false, so
                    far as I was concerned. They kicked me out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that the time that they also dismissed Denise
                        Abbey?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHRSSEN: No. Denise stayed on. I don't know how long, but she was later
                    dismissed for “inefficiency”. She was the most efficient person I've ever met,
                    because she took personal responsibility for what she was doing. You just had to
                    tell her, “Denise, you have to write this and this. We have to do such and
                    such,” and she said, “All right. I know.” And off she went, and she did it. When
                    I was away, she handled the office. She spoke German well enough to understand,
                    and she was respected and loved by everybody. After they had dismissed her, she
                    talked to some other official who knew how much work she had done, and she was
                    assigned a much more important post. I think she took over the information
                    bureau or the library or something, and she had continued in US government
                    service (with USIA) until her retirement.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But she never joined you again after that dismissal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHRSSEN: No, no. I was then sent over to Germany as program control officer at
                    Radio Frankfurt, where I had a little similar experience. Some of my American
                    colleagues in the other German radio stations had been German refugees who had
                    been in the US only relatively few years before they were drafted into the
                    service.Now some of them spoke very poor English, but towards their German staff
                    they insisted they couldn't speak German. It was sort of a punitive action
                    towards their German colleagues. They felt superior. There was no social contact
                    whatsoever, which accounted for a hostile atmosphere within the station. If you
                    work together, you have to talk to each other. But if you pretend you don't know
                    German, and actually you know it better than they do, they don't like it. I had
                    some of them come up for meetings at Radio Frankfurt, and they said, “What's
                    going on here?” Here I was, an American control officer, I sat down with them,
                    and we had coffee. I asked them for dinner or lunch and saw to it that they were
                    properly housed, because they came on my responsibility. They said, “It would
                    never happen in our shop.” And that, I think, was a wrong attitude.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the American complement in charge of German radio was headed by a
                    man who was later under indictment for having been a communist sympathizer.
                    Well, I think everybody has a right to his own opinion. He seemed to have a
                    great antagonism against me. He must have felt that I didn't belong to the
                    crowd, which didn't help me very much. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in Frankfurt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHRSSEN: That was in Frankfurt. I arrived there in December 1946.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After you had gone to America and come back and been
                        assigned to Frankfurt, Germany.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHRSSEN: Yes. But in Frankfurt, I had less responsibility. I was not the boss.
                    So I made my suggestions and I produced my programs, and I didn't have too much
                    contact with my American colleagues.</p>
                <p>Cohrssen Again in Difficulty at Radio in Frankfurt for One of His Broadcast
                    Commentaries</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>I had one program I called “From the Work of the Occupation Forces.” I tried to
                    tell the people what we, as Americans, were trying to do to put the economy back
                    on its feet. It was five minutes or so, once a week or twice a week. I don't
                    recall. Pretty soon I got into trouble again, because it was a question of, I
                    think, 20,000 tons of wool that the Americans had turned over to the German
                    economy in order to have blankets and clothing produced for the needy. That wool
                    had disappeared. I was given this information by some Americans at headquarters,
                    who told me, “Look here. We are desperate. We're trying to do something, but the
                    Germans are not cooperating.” There had been some smart businessman or a group
                    of business people who had gotten hold of this wool and turned it into clothing,
                    all right, but for their own benefit.</p>
                <p>I made that the subject of my commentary. I asked, “Where's the wool?” Well, it
                    raised a tremendous stink in the papers, and then there was a complaint by the
                    German wool interests to headquarters. They were giving me that complaint, and I
                    prepared an answer to it, in consultation with the people at the economic
                    section that was trying to do something. I was not permitted to use it, because
                    headquarters in Wiesbaden said “no”. They explained it: “You're interfering with
                    German-American relations. We have to do business with the people as they are,
                    and we can't have this.”</p>
                <p>My evaluation card to the State Department Information Services evaluating my
                    work was not so good. Why? Our program sessions with the Germans were run by the
                    man we had appointed director of Radio Frankfurt. When during a program
                    conference someone would make a suggestion, “Let's do such and such,” he would
                    say, “No.” I objected: “Wait a minute. This man has an idea. Let's discuss it.
                    If we are against it, we'll vote it down. But let's first find out why it should
                    be no.”</p>
                <p>And so a few times I had to insist. The result was he complained to headquarters
                    that I was undermining his authority, interrupting the good German-American
                    relations. And I got that into my report card. Again, if you stand up for
                    certain principles, it doesn't necessarily serve your own interests.</p>
                <p>1949: US Returns Control of German Radio to Germans: Cohrssen Goes to Radio Free
                    Europe but Soon is Released</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>Anyway, when in 1949-50 the time came to disband the control over German radio, I
                    was offered the opportunity of going to Washington as a member of the State
                    Department USIA, (State Department Information Service). But I also had an offer
                    from Radio Free Europe, which was just setting up in Munich to broadcast across
                    the Iron Curtain. I took that and I became its first program manager. I didn't
                    last long, because again I had a different concept. My idea was to give the
                    Europeans, the free Europeans in the West, and the people behind the Iron
                    Curtain, the same program. I set about to exchange programs with BBC, French
                    Radio, and Italian Radio, in such fields as women's programs, workers' programs,
                    cultural programs; that is programs that would show how people lived in
                    different European Countries, what their problems were, and how they solved
                    them. We would receive the manuscripts, and translate them into different
                    languages, and that way let Europeans east and west participate in our life.</p>
                <p>This wasn't necessarily the concept that the CIA had when it set up Radio Free
                    Europe, and after a year they said, “Cohrssen is still around. Why is he?” So I
                    was released.</p>
                <p>Cohrssen Returns to US to Found New Non-Government Organization and Inaugurates a
                    Voice of Europe Operation</p>
                <p>Coming back to America, I found friends who had similar ideas, and we decided to
                    do something about it. We created a foundation with very good people. I raised
                    some money and went back to Europe trying to establish a “Voice of Europe”
                    program to the United States. I had working journalists in different European
                    capitals, who were capable of formulating European as opposed to national
                    opinions. A movement was under way for European unification, and it was also the
                    policy of the American Government to promote European unification. So we felt we
                    were doing the government's bidding.</p>
                <p>— But Later Developments Prevent Realization</p>
                <p>When we were ready to go, the Council of Europe was to be our partner. We were
                    going to broadcast from Strasbourg announcing, “This is the Voice of Europe;
                    we're broadcasting from the offices of the Council of Europe.” That was all the
                    propaganda they wanted. They had no intention of interfering with our ideas.</p>
                <p>But at that time, [Joseph] McCarthy was against the importation of so-called
                    “foreign ideas,” and we couldn't get the money we had hoped to get from the Ford
                    Foundation. I continued on my own in Europe and got the support of the Congress
                    of European Organizations. That's the German-American clubs, Italo-Americano,
                    France-Etats-Unis, English-speaking Union as the main stem of this. But I had to
                    raise the necessary money. I needed $100,000 and I had pledges for $50,000.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>The German weekly Der Spiegel, patterned after Time magazine, ruined it all by
                    “exposing” me as an American who was having a good time at the expense of the
                    German people. My foundation was granted 18,000 D marks from the German
                    government Press Office to finance setting up this European network. I did not
                    use this money for myself. I was supporting myself by selling Collier's
                    Encyclopedia to the American forces, pushing door bells, going to Army and air
                    bases, on ships coming in, to sell those encyclopedias, and I made a living
                    doing that. [Tape recorder turned off]</p>
                <p>Concluding Comments on Austrian Radio Period</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess we've covered generally most of what you did with
                        the forerunners of the US Information Service. In our time off the record,
                        you commented that you had a few things to say about what you were doing in
                        Austria. So why don't you just take over from there and we'll conclude this
                        interview with your comments in that regard.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHRSSEN: I have found, in the end, that the best thing I could do was to take
                    care of the physical welfare of the people who worked for me, because they had
                    the brains, they had the ideas, and they had the culture to make themselves
                    understood, and introduce American type of democracy, in an Austrian fashion,
                    much better than we could. So my main activity, essentially, was to look after
                    their welfare. I went out to requisition homes. I set up a canteen downstairs.
                    One of the employees was running it. His wife was a good cook, and our people
                    could eat. I gave them transportation so they could go out to the country and
                    get meat and milk and whatever you couldn't buy, to supplement their meager
                    diet.</p>
                <p>That bore good fruit in two ways. First of all, we had a good program. It was the
                    only German language program, Swiss radio took over at that time. Secondly, and
                    it's a funny thing: When Rot-Weiss-Rot celebrated its fortieth anniversary a few
                    years ago, I was the only American whom they interviewed. They had me on TV and
                    on radio, and claimed that I was the one who had built Austrian radio. My merit
                    was that I let them do what they really wanted to, and what they could do, much
                    better than we Americans. I think it bears a lesson to any occupation force.
                    Pick the people who think the way you think, and let them do it their own way.
                    Get out of their way. Give them support. I think that's the result of my
                    experience during this after-war period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that's an excellent idea. What I hope is, of
                        course, that we'll never have to have another war which will end up with an
                        occupation force. But should it be that way, that's a good thought on which
                        to conclude.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHRSSEN: Thank you.</p>
