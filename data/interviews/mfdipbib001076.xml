                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies, let
                        me thank you first of all for participating in our program. We would
                        appreciate it if you would just start with a synopsis of your
                        background.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SKOUFIS: First, let me say that I am delighted to participate in the program. I
                    was born and raised in Bangor, Maine. Both of my parents were immigrants from
                    Greece; they had come to the U.S. as children. They were married in the U.S. and
                    settled in Bangor. My father was a business man there. I graduated from the
                    Bangor Public high School and went to the University of Maine. I graduated in
                    1941. My major was Political Science and History and Government, as it was
                    called at the time.</p>
                <p>While a senior at the University of Maine, I took and passed the Civil Service
                    examination for Junior Professional Assistant (JPA). That was the principal
                    avenue through which college graduates came to work for the United States
                    Government. I thought this might give me the opportunity to pursue my earlier
                    ambition of becoming a lawyer. So after graduating from Maine, I came to
                    Washington and enrolled at George Washington University's Law School and started
                    there in September 1941. At the same time, I accepted an offer from the District
                    of Columbia—Public Health and Welfare Bureau—which was proffered to me through
                    the U.S. Civil Service Commission. The job was that of youth counselor in the
                    Industrial School for Boys on Wisconsin Avenue.</p>
                <p>I became interested in public service because first of all, I had grown up during
                    the depression. I therefore viewed a government job as one that provided the
                    greatest security. I don't think I ever entertained the idea of practicing law,
                    but I did have aspirations to be a government lawyer to work in one of the many
                    new government agencies that had been created as result Roosevelt's New Deal. So
                    I was also interested in working for the Federal Government with a legal
                    background. That is why I selected George Washington as the place to obtain a
                    law degree because I could work for the government while getting my degree.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>So I started my job at the School in September. I lived at the YMCA. Washington
                    was at the time already beginning its defense efforts even though we had not yet
                    entered World War II. People were flooding into Washington, taking jobs in the
                    new temporary government agencies. The job I had was at that Boys' School, which
                    was right across from Pearson's Liquor store in Valley—now it is called the Guy
                    Mason Center. The School was for delinquent children, placed there by the
                    Juvenile Court of Washington and the District's social workers. I was referred
                    to the School by the Civil Service Commission. The reason why I accepted the
                    offer of employment was because of the working conditions. I could live at the
                    School. My duties included getting the kids out of bed at about 6 a.m., taking
                    them to the classrooms and teaching civics. So I was both a teacher and a
                    counselor. I was finished by 2 p.m. which left me free all afternoon and evening
                    to do my George Washington work. It was an ideal set-up for me. The School was
                    run along the lines of Boystown—giving the kids what they were lacking at home
                    and to try to set them on a course of a more fruitful career. These kids had
                    been picked up by the social workers from broken homes, or homes where one
                    parent was in jail, etc. They stayed at the School until the social workers
                    could make alternative arrangements, such as foster homes. The School was run by
                    principal Dan Ahern—former football coach at Western High School and a
                    Georgetown athlete before then (a man of some reputation)—.</p>
                <p>I worked at the School and attended Law School from September, 1941 until May
                    1942. Of course, in December, 1941, war broke out with the bombing of Pearl
                    Harbor. I, like many of my friends and University classmates, volunteered for
                    military service. I had had ROTC training at Bangor High School and had taken
                    some courses that I thought would help me getting my commission. But when I
                    volunteered, I was rejected because of a physical problem that I had. I always
                    had problems with my legs (varicose veins on both sides); so I was declared 4F
                    by the Washington Selective Service Board. In May, 1942, I figured that I would
                    have to find a position more in line with my career objectives. I applied for
                    jobs throughout the Washington area. I applied to the Department of Agriculture,
                    looking for a job in the administrative area, which was then headed by a Mr.
                    William Jump, who was a very distinguished civil servant. I was accepted around
                    the middle of May, 1942. I went home briefly to pick up some more of my
                    possessions to move it all to Washington.</p>
                <p>While in Bangor, I walked by my draft board which had kept in touch with me
                    although my classification had been issued by the Washington board. I dropped in
                    on the Bangor board to inform it of my new Washington address which was a
                    rooming house convenient to the Agriculture Department. The fellow, who was an
                    old family friend, at the Bangor board said: “Pete, we were about to call you”.
                    I told him that I had already been processed and classified 4F. He said that
                    that had been issued by the Washington board and didn't have validity because I
                    was a Bangor resident and therefore under the jurisdiction of the Bangor board.
                    So I began the process all over again; I started on a Saturday morning and by
                    Saturday night, I was in the service. I had to call Washington; I couldn't get
                    there in person because I had to report for duty at Fort Devens in a couple
                    days. I was told by Ahern that I would be put on “military leave” by the Boys
                    School. I never became an employee of the Agriculture Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>First I went into the Army, then transferred to the Air Force and went to Florida
                    and Sioux Falls, S.D. as an enlisted man. The latter was a radio operator's
                    school and I became a radio operator until a notice came around offering people
                    opportunity to go to Officers' Candidate School (OCS). I told them about my legs
                    and they sent me to the hospital to see whether I could medically qualify for
                    the Air Force training programs. At the hospital, I met a Dr. Butler from
                    Bangor, who also knew my family and was a dear friend of my father's. Talk about
                    luck in life!. I told Dr. Butler about my rejection when I tried to volunteer.
                    He said he would fix me up and put me in the Sioux Falls hospital. I underwent a
                    “bilateral ligation” operation. That fixed my problems and I got my medical
                    clearance.</p>
                <p>The first opportunity for OCS training required some ground school training
                    followed by Air Force training; they wanted us to become ground liaison
                    officers. So I went to Fort Benning in 1943 to become an infantry officer. After
                    I got my gold bar, I went to Brooks Field in Texas where I became an aerial
                    observer for a gunnery battalion. Then I was shipped out to the Pacific and
                    ended up in Okinawa. By the end of the war, I was assigned to personnel work
                    because my expertise became rather redundant. I was with a B-24 group—the 7th
                    Bomber Command. Toward the end of the war, the B-29s became the main Air Force
                    weapon system; they could fly to targets that the B-24s couldn't reach. So the
                    war was over for many of the B-24 groups when the B-29 were phased in.</p>
                <p>The Air Force had established a very elaborate personnel program to repatriate
                    their personnel to the U.S. I got involved in that process as a personnel
                    officer. That gave me some credentials. I sought that assignment because I was
                    virtually unemployed in the 7th Bomber Command. My main role in Okinawa was to
                    evacuate the POW camps in Japan. Unfortunately, I spent my last days in Okinawa
                    in a hospital because I developed a growth on the back of my right calf. It was
                    diagnosed as a melanoma—a wart that grew quickly and became red and bloody. I
                    went to the hospital and had it excised. The pathologist said that he had found
                    some malignancy through the biopsy. I brought the sample back with me in a
                    bottle when I was ordered back to the U.S. for further treatment. I sailed from
                    Okinawa on a hospital ship to Seattle and then Fort Devens, where my service had
                    started. That was the nearest military hospital to Bangor. At Fort Devens, they
                    decided that I really should go to Walter Reed Hospital in Washington for
                    chemotherapy treatment (or what was then called “chemotherapy”). So I went to
                    Walter Reed and was there from February to mid-April, 1946 under observation for
                    cancer. They would give me tests every day, but I was very ambulatory and I felt
                    pretty good. So I spent a lot of time being entertained royally by the citizens
                    of Washington—free tickets to shows, dinner invitations, etc.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>I had plenty of time to formulate my plans for the future, including the
                    resumption of my law school education which had been interrupted. I got in touch
                    with the Boys School. Dan Ahern had left to go to work for the Veterans
                    Administration; he was counseling veterans about the GI bill. I went to see him.
                    I told him what my plans were which were to return to the Boys School. He
                    discouraged me; he said that things had changed there and that I really
                    shouldn't return. He suggested I come to work for the VA. I told him I couldn't
                    do that because I was still in the military leave. He said that that was no
                    problem. The School would put me on its roll for one day so that I could
                    re-enter the civil service. Then the VA would pick me up. He turned me over to a
                    personnel officer. I went before a medical board and I got my discharge. That
                    was about the middle of June. The next day, I went to work for the VA as a
                    registration officer. I determined eligibility for training under the GI “Bill
                    of Rights”. My section was called “Registration and Rehabilitation”. After
                    determining their eligibility, we counseled veterans on what courses they could
                    take. At the time, the eligibility was determined by the number of months one
                    had served in the military. The minimum was three months; the maximum was four
                    years of college training. The program was doing very well.</p>
                <p>I made an attempt to return to law school in September, but that was very
                    difficult because everyone was returning to school and there was a real jam up.
                    I probably would have had to apply in January or February, but I was still in
                    the hospital at that time. In any case, I became very interested in my VA work
                    and I was progressing pretty well and became chief of a section—a GS 11
                    position—in the Washington regional office on the corner of H Street and
                    Pennsylvania Avenue. One of my poignant memories of those days concerns the
                    first weekend I was working in that regional office. We were then on C Street
                    and Indian Avenue, where the District government now has its offices. We
                    received word that we would be moving to H Street over Memorial Day weekend and
                    that if we wanted to help, we would be paid over-time. I volunteered as many
                    others did. We worked around the clock that weekend, putting stuff in boxes,
                    putting boxes into trucks, unloading the trucks and then opening the boxes and
                    putting their contents away in the new location. I think I received $200-300 for
                    that weekend work and that was more money than I had seen in a long time. It was
                    enough for a down-payment on an old Ford that I bought. I was living then in
                    McLean Gardens apartments right off Wisconsin Avenue that had been built during
                    the war. There was dormitory arrangement for single people—one building for
                    males and one for females. I used to commute from there to the VA office, which
                    was rather chaotic both because it was a new bureaucratic venture and because it
                    had thousands and thousands of applicants. There were all sorts of
                    problems—insufficient documentation, documentation that could not be certified,
                    particularly discharge papers which were important because the law limited the
                    benefits to only those who were discharged under “honorable conditions”.
                    Washington was a very crowded city because a lot of people were coming to the
                    government where things were beginning to happen.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>The educational benefits provided under the GI bill were tremendous. A lot of our
                    cases were for new schools that had sprung up practically overnight. Schools for
                    radio mechanics, barber colleges, all sorts of new institutions, some obviously
                    fly-by-night, but still eligible to take students supported by the VA. The
                    student grants were about $30 per month for a single student and $50 for a
                    married person. In addition, the GI bill paid for tuition, books and supplies.
                    It was quite an operation and made for a very interesting experience. As I said,
                    Washington became a very, very busy place.</p>
                <p>My colleagues were very interesting. I became acquainted there with Harry McKee
                    who later also joined the Foreign Service and became a close friend. By and
                    large, they were very competent. They were very much like the group I had known
                    before my military service. They were in Washington for a purpose, namely to
                    further their education. Many of my co-workers were very much like myself; they
                    had their education interrupted by the war and had come to Washington to resume
                    it. The jobs were here and so were the educational facilities. So we shared many
                    common experiences and aspirations. The VA office I worked in was very
                    active.</p>
                <p>When I realized that I would not be able to return to law school in September,
                    1946, I took courses at the Graduate School of the Department of Agriculture. I
                    took courses in personnel administration to further my interests and some other
                    courses in the administrative area, such as budget. I did that for six months. I
                    had already developed an interest by this time in management/administration.</p>
                <p>One day, a flier came across my desk which announced that the VA was going to
                    open offices in Paris, London, Rome, Mexico City, Manila and elsewhere to
                    service the many ex-GIs who had decided to reside abroad. The VA was looking for
                    candidates to fill these new offices. I was getting pretty tired by this time of
                    waiting for the law school to admit me; I rationalized that I had spent the war
                    years on one island after another, including 13 months in Honolulu at Hickam
                    Field; the rest of the time I was on Guam, Okinawa, Saipan, etc. I debated the
                    opportunity to go to Paris. You had to be able to speak French. That happened to
                    be fine with me because if you come from Maine, you speak French as a second
                    language. It wasn't exactly Parisian French; it was Canadian French. I had also
                    had French in college; that had been my foreign language at the University of
                    Maine, which was the customary thing to do. So I decided to throw my hat in for
                    Paris although with some trepidation because I realized that I was not a fluent
                    French speaker. Harry McKee, who was then heading a unit very near me, decided
                    to apply for a job in London.</p>
                <p>Both of us were called by some people in the central office who were staffing
                    these foreign posts. Both of us were accepted and slated to be sent to Europe. I
                    had never been in Europe; my ideas of Paris came from travelogues, fantasies and
                    ex-GIs who had served in Europe and were now working for the VA. While sitting
                    in Okinawa with little to do, I had expressed an interest in military
                    governments which were being established all over the world. I thought that if I
                    had been accepted, I might have served in Europe, which would have exposed me to
                    a part of the world I had not seen.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>We were then instructed to report to the State Department for indoctrination and
                    to become a member of the United States Foreign Service. An agreement had been
                    reached between the VA and the State Department which was known as the
                    “Bradley-Byrnes” agreement (Omar Bradley having been the head of the VA and
                    Jimmy Byrnes the Secretary of State). That agreement stipulated that the VA
                    would supply the technical personnel and the Foreign Service would supply the
                    administrative support necessary to establish and maintain these new veterans'
                    offices. The team would consist of a senior VA officer, who would then become
                    the Veterans' Attach�. These teams would take care not only of screening the
                    applications for educational grants, but also administer the claims
                    programs—insurance, death, pensions, etc—which were necessary to support the
                    widows of dead veterans. Many of these women were foreigners and many had
                    children who were also eligible for certain benefits.</p>
                <p>My senior officer, Mr. Share, had been a claims officer in the VA after World War
                    I (he was a World War I veteran). I headed a group, consisting of four people
                    and I also was the Registration person who determined eligibility under the
                    school programs. We had two counselors to help veterans select programs and we
                    had a budget and fiscal officer. The latter was there because the State
                    Department was not able to handle the greatly increased workload of payments for
                    substance or tuition and books. The Embassies and consulates were just
                    collecting the filled out forms and sending them back to Washington to the
                    International Affairs office of the VA. State didn't have either enough people
                    or sufficiently trained people to handle the workload.</p>
                <p>In my case, my Foreign Service appointment was to the Foreign Service Staff (FSS)
                    Corps. My boss, Mr. Share, was given a Foreign Service Reserve (FSR)
                    appointment. All the VA field office directors got FSR appointments. The staff
                    members were given FSS appointments. My payment for accumulated annual leave—six
                    or seven days—was given to me by the VA and then I was separated from the Civil
                    Service. I was sworn into the Foreign Service. I had been earning $4,500 per
                    annum at the VA; that was probably the salary of a GS-11 at the time. The FSS-8
                    level, which I was given provided roughly the same pay, but in fact my earnings
                    almost doubled because in addition to salary, the Foreign Service give
                    allowances to its employees. Those allowances were primarily to pay for rent in
                    Paris and maybe for a cost-of-living differential. So that when I went to Paris,
                    my gross income was $9,000. I thought I had made a great career change. Going to
                    Paris with that kind of income seemed to be the most that the world could offer
                    me. I took the Paris job and left for France soon thereafter. I actually entered
                    the Foreign Service in March, 1947.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Paris was a great experience. I went to France by ship—a converted troop ship. On
                    the same ship, was a VA team that was going to open the Geneva office—John Hays,
                    Randy Dickens and Frank Harris. The Paris office had already opened several
                    months earlier. Share, his secretary and others were already in place. We sailed
                    at the end of April. Hays had been in the Army's military government—G-5—and had
                    been in France and Paris from right after the invasion. He was coming from the
                    Richmond, VA office as did his whole team. He had with him a convertible
                    Cadillac which was unloaded at Le Havre. He was going to drive to Geneva through
                    Paris and asked me if I wanted to go along. That was a trip! Every town we went
                    through, brought back some memories to John of his war campaigns. He would visit
                    a French family here and one there; he would see mayors with whom he had worked.
                    Everywhere we went he was greeted like a long lost friend who was returning
                    home. We got our fill of Calvados. It took us three days to get from Le Havre to
                    Paris.</p>
                <p>When I got to Paris, Share wanted to know where the hell I had been. He said that
                    the Embassy had been looking for me. So I went there and found that it was the
                    Budget and Fiscal section who was looking for me because I was on their payroll.
                    That section was run by Larry Daimond; Joe Dagenhart was the Finance Officer—he
                    was the one who signed the checks. The Veterans Program was actually a part of
                    the Consular Section because it had been determined that our functions were more
                    akin to that of the Consular section than any other embassy office. So we
                    reported to the chief Consular officer. Physically, we had separate offices in
                    the Hotel D'Iena off the Champs-Elys�es. We shared space with the Office of the
                    Foreign Liquidation Commission, which was an Army operation aimed at getting rid
                    of all of the Army's surplus equipment in Europe. Paris was the headquarters. We
                    ate in the Embassy cafeteria. The Embassy assigned us an old Chrysler for
                    transportation purposes which we used to go to the Embassy for lunch. There were
                    no other restaurants in Paris at the time—food rationing was still in
                    effect.</p>
                <p>I also remember a long May weekend. My birthday was May 7 and on this particular
                    year, it fell on a French holiday which made it a long weekend. During the next
                    week there was another holiday—the day the Allied troops liberated Paris in
                    1945. The following week, we had another holiday. So it seemed to me that for
                    the first few weeks I was in Paris, we only worked four-day weeks. I just
                    couldn't get over that. I thought it was a great deal. That of course was sheer
                    coincidence, but I won't forget that introduction to French work habits. We had
                    a lot of work to do because we found that the French schools—primarily the
                    University of Paris—had not been paid at all even though it had accepted ex-GIs
                    as students. They had sent bills to the Embassy for tuition and books and wanted
                    reimbursement. There were about 2,000 American students who had taken their
                    discharges abroad and were attending universities in France. Then there were
                    another approximately 1,500 claims, mostly coming from French dependents of
                    soldiers who had been killed in the war. We also had to work on claims by World
                    War I veterans whose benefits had been interrupted by the war and who wished to
                    be reinstated. So the office's workload was heavy.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>My primary function was to get the veterans on a payroll so that their benefits
                    would begin to flow. Some because they had not been paid were already beginning
                    to become involved in illegal activities so that they could make enough to live
                    on. The black market was rampant in Paris and in Europe in general, especially
                    in currency dealings and cigarettes. The ex-GIs were getting packages from home,
                    or were buying goods from friends who had commissary and the PX privileges—there
                    were still in existence—and selling the goods on the black market. There were
                    still all sorts of small military units all around Paris cleaning up after the
                    war. There was very unsavory business being conducted at the time. Both the VA
                    and the State Department were anxious to get some money to these veterans so
                    that they would not need to survive from illegal operations.</p>
                <p>We finally got straightened out and money began to flow to the veterans. We
                    worked out a system which permitted the checks to be written in Paris rather
                    than in Washington. Our finance man, Bob Griggs, who had worked in the VA's
                    Buffalo office, set up a system with Joe Dagenhart which permitted Joe to issue
                    monthly checks to a list of people that Bob would provide with the amounts of
                    their entitlement. I certified that list which was time consuming because I had
                    to check to make sure that all of the people on the list were eligible.</p>
                <p>At the end of the month, the check would be ready for the veterans or other
                    beneficiaries. The big problem was how to get these checks to the recipients.
                    The veterans were living in rooming and boarding houses all over Paris and were
                    constantly moving. So we decided that they would have to come to our offices to
                    pick up the checks. That meant that on the first of the month there were would
                    be long line of people waiting for his or her check. It was useful to us because
                    it also meant that we knew that the intended recipient was still alive and that
                    the checks were getting to the right person. We asked the recipients to certify
                    at the time he or she picked up the check that they were in fact still going to
                    school and therefor eligible for their benefits. That satisfied the GAO
                    requirements. The system was somewhat cumbersome, but it worked well. After
                    about six months in Paris, we moved from the Hotel D'Iena to the Embassy and
                    were co-located with the Consular Section. The Embassy had vacated the space by
                    moving out the regional courier office. So the grantees came to the Embassy on
                    the first day of every month. Of course, the Consular section was well known to
                    many of the ex-GIs because that is where they had to go whenever they lost or
                    had stolen their passports. That happened frequently. The Consular officer was
                    Agnes Schneider who was a real legend in the Foreign Service; she was in charge
                    of the Passport section. The ex-GIs had quickly learned that their passports
                    were valuable commodities; that increased the issuances of new passports
                    considerably. I found veterans to be pretty good guys, but many acquired
                    unsavory reputations in the Consular section.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>A lot of the veterans were artists who were going to art schools in Paris.
                    Because of their temperament they were difficult to deal with; some were nearly
                    impossible. A lot studied French; others just stayed there because Paris was
                    just a nice place to be after the war. They all needed the $50 per month
                    subsistence allowance. There were a number of future distinguished people among
                    the beneficiaries—people like Art Buchwald, who had been a Marine who stayed to
                    study French at the Alliance Frances because he enjoyed the place and he had a
                    chance to write. I would say that 60-70% were serious students; the others were
                    there for the thrill of being in Paris.</p>
                <p>For most of our substantive work, we dealt directly with the VA in Washington. We
                    started to send material through the State Department, but then found out that
                    headquarters was not receiving our mail. There was no special office in the
                    Department that was concerned with our operations so that much of our mail
                    seemed to disappear. There was a woman in the Department that was supposed to
                    act as the liaison with the VA, but she became overwhelmed by the workload. So
                    we began to sent most of our reports—fiscal, etc—directly to the VA. We were
                    spending its appropriations and it had to have these reports to maintain
                    accountability. So we worked closely with the VA on the technical aspects of our
                    work.</p>
                <p>I got to Paris in 1947 and stayed for four years. As we gained experience, we
                    developed a modus operandi with State Department—the Paris Embassy and the VA
                    Office. The system worked very well; the Embassy became much more responsive to
                    our problems in terms of space and administrative support in general. One
                    indication of that was the fact that we were permitted to move into the Embassy.
                    After my first year in Paris, the Embassy improved greatly in the administrative
                    area with the arrival of Graham Martin as the chief administrative officer. He
                    brought with him a team of administrative people who greatly improved the
                    Embassy's operations and made it much more responsive to its clients' need
                    including our own. We got space and people when we needed them. We were quite
                    happy with Martin, Eddie Crouch, Seaborn Foster, Harvey Bufallo, Jack Herfurt—a
                    whole succession of administrative types who were complete professionals. The
                    administrative support became first rate and our relationships with the Embassy
                    became very good. Although we were, as were all Staff Corps personnel,
                    responsible for finding our own housing, but we were given lots of help.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Ambassador Bruce became Ambassador. He used to walk around the Embassy from time
                    to time just to see how things went. He was not an infrequent visitor to our
                    offices. He would say that he was a veteran and would ask about his insurance
                    program. We would brief him on how it operated and that if he wanted to keep up
                    his insurance, he had to pay premiums. Then he would ask about the programs for
                    which he was eligible. He took an interest in us and made us feel a part of the
                    Embassy. It really gave our morale a boost. That was also true of the Consul
                    General, who was Joe Gray. We were all included in the Embassy-wide parties,
                    like 4th of July. We really felt part of the Embassy and of the Consular Section
                    especially. There weren't many men officers in the Consular Section, so were
                    very welcomed. The women officers used to call on us if they ever encountered a
                    male problem, e.g. some obstreperous American young man who was getting out of
                    line. We were sitting close by and would come to the rescue of the woman
                    consular officer. In general, the Embassy was very forthcoming, both work-wise
                    and socially.</p>
                <p>However, one problem developed. As I mentioned earlier, we had all entered the
                    Foreign Service in the Staff Corps except for the head man, who was an FSR. We
                    became part of the Department's promotion system; the Inspectors reviewed our
                    work; we were subject to the performance evaluation system—we were full-fledged
                    members of the Foreign Service for personnel administration purposes. But no one
                    performing VA work was getting promotions. As I was an FSS-8 as was Harry McKee
                    in London; Columbo in Rome was at the same grade and none of us were getting
                    promoted. The staff corps was being reviewed yearly and yearly some were being
                    promoted, but none of us. So after three years, I went in to talk to the
                    administrative people. I was delegated by my boss to talk to the Embassy on
                    behalf of all of us doing veterans' work. I was told that the VA people didn't
                    really work for the State Department; we were working, in their eyes, for the
                    VA. We were viewed as temporary employees of the Foreign Service who were in the
                    Foreign Service for administrative convenience, but whose career was in the VA.
                    I pointed out that we had been separated from the VA and that we were no longer
                    a part of the Civil Service. We believed that we were full-fledged members of
                    the State Department. I finally convinced the Embassy that we were indeed
                    members of the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>The Embassy referred the matter back to Washington. And there we found the same
                    problem; our names had not been considered by the promotion panels because we
                    were not considered part of the Foreign Service. We were viewed essentially as
                    temporary adjuncts. We became very discouraged because we had really fallen into
                    a crack. I was the Consular Section's duty officer when North Korea invaded the
                    South—I thought we were back in the Civil War (although the Department did not
                    consider us as full fledged members of the Foreign Service, the we were fully
                    integrated in the Consular Section and took our turns as duty officers) I got a
                    call in French from a representative of the Press Francais wanting to know what
                    the Embassy's views were and what we were doing about this development. I told
                    him that I would call back and ran upstairs to the Ambassador's office. There
                    were several people there following developments. As time passed, we realized
                    that the U.S. would join the conflict. All of us in the VA saw a repeat of
                    previous experiences—another GI bill, another cycle of support.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>I went to see Graham Martin and told him that I didn't want to stay in the VA
                    operation. I wanted out and was prepared to return to the U.S. He asked whether
                    I would be interested in working for the Embassy. I told him that I had been in
                    Paris for four years and that I thought it was time to move on. I had been
                    recently married and I though it was time to get back home. Then I got a cable
                    from the VA informing me that Tom Quinnen in Rome was about to retire and that I
                    had been assigned to replace him. I thought that that job sounded interesting; I
                    wanted to get back to Italy and I would be in charge of the office. Tom had been
                    an FSR and an Attach�—diplomatic passport and status. The VA promised that I
                    would be given the same rank and privileges that Tom had had.</p>
                <p>So at the end of 1950, Helen and I embarked for Rome; we were anxious to do a
                    tour there. We drove to Rome with all of our earthly belongings. We didn't have
                    many personal effects because we had lived in a furnished apartment in Paris
                    after we were married in 1949. After we arrived in Rome, we ran into similar
                    problems. The Department's attitudes toward the former VA employees had been
                    adopted by Embassy Rome. We were to be supported by the Embassy, but were viewed
                    as essentially VA employees. I did my best to disabuse them of that notion. The
                    Rome administrative officer was Gase Lukas, assisted by Tom Carroll and Jim
                    McDevitt. Mrs. Flack was the disbursing officer. We dealt with her because she
                    got the money from the VA and wrote out the checks to our clients.</p>
                <p>So we had the same perception problems in Rome as we had had in Paris. The “straw
                    that broke that camel's back” came when my mother sent me a Christmas
                    present—some shirts and ties. The package was held up by the Italian postal
                    authorities for customs duties. At the time, that duty may have been all of
                    $1.50 or perhaps even less. I refused to pay it and sent the chit I had received
                    to the personnel office so that they would clear my package through customs
                    under the diplomatic immunity process. I was then told that my name was not on
                    the “Diplomatic List”. I said that I was replacing Tom Quinnen as the head of
                    the VA office and had been told that I would be accorded the same privileges
                    that he had. The Embassy checked with the State Department who again took the
                    position that I worked for the VA and therefore not eligible for any diplomatic
                    privileges. That meant that my car would also be subjected to taxation; I
                    refused to pay that as well. The Embassy said that my car would be impounded; I
                    said “So be it”. I became very stubborn.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Of course, we had a very busy office and I had many other things to do besides
                    wrestling with the State Department's bureaucracy. Finally, Gase Lukas used his
                    own name to clear my package through customs and some else was worked out on the
                    car; I never did pay taxes. So slowly our status was clarified. In the meantime
                    in Paris, a regional office to handle VA matters was established by
                    consolidating the London and Paris offices so that our relationships with
                    Washington began to flow though Paris. But there not seemed to have been any
                    meeting of minds in Washington on our status; each Embassy played it by ear.
                    Some of them were very flexible; they did their level best and kept the paper
                    flowing. In those days, they didn't send cables on this subject, but sent
                    “Operations Memoranda”. They kept us pretty well informed. In any case, we knew
                    from the annual promotion lists which never included any ex-VA people.</p>
                <p>It was getting close to five years without any of us having been promoted. Our
                    status was still being debated. I went to Rome on a direct transfer in December,
                    1951. I stayed there until the summer. The work-load was different in Rome than
                    it had been in Paris. There were fewer students and more claims. All the
                    payments to Italian beneficiaries had been suspended during World War II because
                    Italy was an enemy nation. Payments could only be resumed after the claimant had
                    certified to his or her eligibility and after we had investigated the claim
                    because payments could not be made to those who had aided and abetted the enemy.
                    Most of the beneficiaries were World War I veterans who were poor and farmers
                    and who had come to Italy during our Depression. A high proportion had been
                    victims of poison gas during World War I and were therefore eligible for small
                    disability pensions. During the Depression, they found out that the small
                    amounts went further in Italy then they did in the U.S. and went to there to
                    live. There must have been over 2,000 World War I veterans living in Italy. Of
                    course, when the veteran died, his widow received half of the benefits, which
                    although very little, still enabled them to live in a small Italian village. A
                    system was worked out which permitted them to cash their checks at the Bank
                    D'Italia; we would sent the dollar check to the Bank which would then call the
                    payee and make the payment in lira.</p>
                <p>We lived in a furnished apartment in Rome. Two of my staff, who had families,
                    were housed in government owned housing in a new apartment building that the
                    U.S. government had built. The allowances were adequate to cover the rent. Our
                    offices were an integral part of the Consular Section, which was in a small
                    villa next to the Chancery. Later we were moved to the FIAT building which was
                    just two blocks down the street toward the railroad station. We were housed
                    there along with some other U.S. government offices. We moved primarily because
                    we needed more space which couldn't be provided in the villa. Our files were
                    growing by leaps and bounds. We hired more local personnel to handle the paper
                    work and to serve as interpreters. All our documents had to be translated;
                    furthermore, in Italy, out clients were more often natives than they were in
                    France. Many of the ex-GIs were also artists. Also we had a large contingent
                    going to the medical school in Bologna because the American schools were
                    over-subscribed and Bologna's medical school had a very good reputation.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>My job in Rome was to be the head of the office. I had five or six Americans
                    working for me and probably the same number of locals. Our principal contact was
                    the Consul General and the administrative and disbursing officers. We always
                    faced that end-of-the-month deadline; we would bring the payroll to the
                    disbursing office a couple of days before the end of the month and someone there
                    would then type out the checks. I thought that the Rome Embassy, just like the
                    Paris one, did a very good job in helping us. For example, my mother's package
                    issue was resolved by subsequently having her use the APO—she had sent the first
                    package by international mail. We enjoyed living abroad and the emoluments were
                    fair; we thought that if one had to work for Uncle Sam, doing so abroad was as
                    rich as experience as one could have. We had good personal relations with the
                    Rome Embassy staff, but unlike Paris, we of course never saw the Ambassador, Mr.
                    James Dunn. I think I saw the DCM, Llewellyn Thompson one time when I first
                    arrived and reported to him. I had by that time become “Foreign Service wise”
                    and knew what one had to do, like “dropping the card”. We were very much
                    integrated into the Consular Section. The legal staff helped us from time to
                    time because we needed assistance on the status of the Italian claimants.</p>
                <p>The only fly in the ointment was that nagging question of our status and that
                    began to wear on me. There were a lot of other new activities—agriculture,
                    commerce—that were being integrated into the Department and did not seem to have
                    the same problems that we did. There were always a lot of discussions on “how he
                    got into the Foreign Service?”—the Manpower Act, the Ramspeck Act, etc. In the
                    meantime, the VA group was entirely neglected. I had become much more militant
                    on the question of the ex-VA staff feeling that I representing not only myself,
                    but all my colleagues around the world who were also being left out in the cold.
                    Since I had been one of the earliest people to join the Foreign Service, people
                    looked to me to carry their message. I was to be the test case and although I
                    don't think I antagonized anyone, I was always after the administrative people
                    to resolve our issue. Socially, we were part of the consular group and very much
                    involved. As in Paris, we were invited to the Fourth of July party where we
                    would meet the Ambassador and his wife. The ladies were very expert in taking
                    your hand and moving you right along; I was always amazed how they managed to
                    keep the line going; you got moved from one side of them to the other in a
                    hurry.</p>
                <p>The Embassy's personnel office—Jim McDevitt and Tom Carroll—were very helpful and
                    were constantly bugging the Department about our issue. One day there was an
                    announcement that two “high” State Department officials were coming to Rome and
                    that they would be available for consultation on any problems any one might
                    have. These officials were Pete Martin and Bill Boswell, who were part of the
                    Foreign Service Administration Office. I took the opportunity to talk to them
                    about our problem. They took notes and promised to look into it when they got
                    back to Washington. It was roughly the same conversation I had had with members
                    of the Inspection Corps when they were in Paris several years earlier. That
                    dialogue never produced anything. In any case, I didn't hear anything directly
                    from Martin and Boswell; I was still an FSS, my car still had a French license
                    plate because I refused to pay the Italian tax. I was not on any diplomatic list
                    provided the Italian Foreign Ministry. That was the situation when we went on
                    home leave.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Helen and I agreed that I would leave the Foreign Service as long as it didn't
                    recognize us as a part of it. I had written to the VA people who were anxious to
                    have me return to their employment. It was about to seek new authorities to
                    handle its work-load. While in Rome, I had written a paper on how I thought the
                    system could be improved—eligibility determination, fraud elimination (which was
                    not unusual on the part of “schools” which were not that and our own veterans
                    who did not attend schools but took the stipends. People at the schools would
                    certify anybody's attendance. In fact, schools in Europe did not take attendance
                    very often and the educational system really didn't care whether you attended
                    classes or not. It was a different educational system from the American one—we
                    were more disciplined. We adapted the Americans rules to the European
                    circumstances and did the best we could. We also had inadequate man-power to
                    investigate all the fraud possibilities. The schools, of course, were interested
                    in maximizing their rolls to earn more tuition. The language training schools
                    were particularly loose in their monitoring of attendance and we used to watch
                    them particularly carefully). My paper had received some attention at VA
                    headquarters and the people there seemed eager to have me come back to the
                    organization in the International Affairs Office.</p>
                <p>When I arrived in Washington, I reported to the State Department's personnel
                    office. I had been at the VA and had worked all the arrangements which would
                    bring me back into the Civil Service. But I went to see a Miss Bland, who was
                    the personnel officer for the European region in the central Personnel Office.
                    She knew my case and said that I would be returning to Rome—I did have round
                    trip travel orders. Then I told her that my plans had changed and that I was
                    terminating my association with the Foreign Service to return to the VA. She
                    tried to talk me out of it. When I told her for my reasons for leaving, she
                    acted surprised because she said that she had written me about my status issue.
                    I said that I have never received a letter. She told me to come back in a couple
                    of days and she would then have my file available with a copy of this
                    letter.</p>
                <p>As I left her office, I ran into my old college classmate, Art Weatherbee. We had
                    gone to Maine University together. Art was then in the Personnel Office working
                    with Art Jean. He was a mid-level manager in the Personnel Office. So we chatted
                    and I told him about my experiences in the Foreign Service. He also acted
                    surprised because he thought that the issue had been resolved. I then repeated
                    what I had told Miss Bland, namely that nothing had happened and I had not
                    received any communications which reflected any change in the Department's
                    attitude to the ex-VA types. Of course, I had been on a ship for the last few
                    days as was the custom in those days so that I had not had any mail for at least
                    two weeks. Art repeated that my problem had been taken care of after he had been
                    given to him by Pete Martin and Bill Boswell. I told him that I would be back in
                    a couple of days, but that in the meantime, I was working on leaving the Service
                    and exercising my re-employment rights with the VA. Art asked me to reconsider
                    because the Department was expanding and looking for manpower. He also asked
                    that I return to see him.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>I returned in a couple of days to see Miss Bland. She opened my file and there
                    was the letter that was supposed to have been sent to me. Whoever drafted it,
                    apparently put into my file by mistake because it was still unsigned. That
                    really confirmed to me how screwed up the Department was. Martin and Boswell
                    were in Rome in May; I went on home leave in September and not a word from the
                    Department in the intervening period, despite the several inquiries from the
                    Embassy in Rome. I thought that this was another example of the Department's
                    operations; when you are face-to-face, then it responds; if you are far away, no
                    action is taken. In any case, the letter explained that the Department had
                    finally located the Bradley-Byrnes agreement of 1947. Until we had reminded them
                    of it, the people in Washington didn't even know it existed! The personnel
                    people had in the letter agreed that I had been quite right and that I was a
                    member of the Foreign Service all the years since I had arrived in Paris. I
                    thanked them for letting me know after all these years that I had been correct,
                    but I pointed out that they were a little later—I was no longer interested in
                    the State Department. They said they would send me back to do veterans' work,
                    but I told them that I had done for five years and it was time for me to move
                    on. There was another wave of claims and applicants stemming from the Korean War
                    and I had had enough of that work.</p>
                <p>Then I went to see Art Weatherbee, who by that time had also found out that
                    someone had goofed. I think all the personnel types had a guilty feeling because
                    they had all let my case fall in the cracks. He also suggested that I wait for a
                    little while; he suggested that I go to Bangor for my home leave and let him
                    have my home phone number so that when a good assignment came up, he could reach
                    me. So that is what I did.</p>
                <p>We went to Bangor. I had told my friends in the VA that I would be back in
                    Washington in a month after my home leave. I stayed on the State Department's
                    payroll while on home leave. Shortly after arriving in Bangor, someone in
                    Personnel called me and said that there were two administrative jobs opening up,
                    one in Israel and one in South Africa. The personnel type wanted to know whether
                    I would be interested in becoming an administrative officer. I said that I
                    wasn't really sure. But the more I thought about it and the more I discussed it
                    with Helen, the more interested we became. I was more interested in the South
                    Africa job because my father had a relative who lived there and who had recently
                    visited Bangor—the first time since they were kids in the old country (one had
                    left Greece to go to the United States and the other had gone to South Africa).
                    I didn't return the personnel officer's call while cogitating on my options. So
                    one day, he called me back and said he had to know. I told him that we were
                    prepared to stay in the Foreign Service and that we were prepared to go to South
                    Africa. He said he was delighted and that I could count on becoming the
                    administrative officer in Pretoria in about three or four months. In the
                    meantime, he said I would be assigned to the Foreign Service Institute.</p>

                <p>When I returned to Washington, I went to see Miss Bland again, who was so
                    embarrassed by the whole series of events that she turned me over to one of her
                    colleagues. That person arranged for me to see Art Stevens, who was the
                    Executive Director for the Bureau of European Affairs (his deputy was Herman
                    Pollack). South Africa at the time was under the jurisdiction of EUR. In any
                    case, I was known in EUR because I had just finished a tour in Rome and my
                    situation was known to the Bureau. I was told by the personnel officer in EUR
                    that everybody was trying to find a way to remedy my lack of promotion which I
                    and all my ex-VA colleagues had suffered through the Department's error. I cited
                    the case of Jack Herfurt, Seaborn Foster and Eddie Crouch who had joined the
                    Foreign Service as FSS, but had become Foreign Service Officers (FSO). Herfurt
                    received two promotions in one year as a security officer. I assumed he had an
                    “angel” watching over him back in Washington. He had figured out how to beat the
                    system and how to get promoted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did the Department tag you as an “administrative”
                        type? Hadn't you work been primarily in veterans' claims and benefit
                        determination?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SKOUFIS: I assume because of my background in personnel and my education. Also in
                    my Rome job, the duties were mostly of an administrative/management character. I
                    might have been assigned to a consular job as happened to many of my colleagues
                    in fact—John Bargus, Brian Collins, Gallow, for example. All of the former VA
                    staffers left their jobs shortly after I did and the Department was very
                    forthcoming in offering them jobs in other Foreign Service activities. Harry
                    McKee was the other ex-Va man who entered the administrative field. A couple
                    quit and returned home. But most of that first group of people who had opened
                    the VA overseas offices left that work and entered other phases of the Foreign
                    Service. The Department tried hard to remedy the damage done by the lack of
                    promotions. I went to South Africa after attending one of the first
                    administrative officer training programs ever offered by the FSI. It was taught
                    by Doc Waterman. It was three or four weeks long and I found it very
                    interesting. Most of it concerned finance and State's financial process; we also
                    learned about the functions of an administrative staff and what was expected of
                    an administrative officer. We sat in with the Budget and Fiscal officers who
                    were attending their own training program when the subject matters of the two
                    programs overlapped.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Charlie Tanguy was one of my colleagues in the course. Most of the people in the
                    class were expanding their foreign service experience; they had been serving in
                    other foreign service functions, like political and consular. They wanted to
                    take a crack at an administrative officer position. I thought the course was
                    very good. I was very impressed. It covered the whole range of administrative
                    activities as well as the role of administration in the Foreign Service. That
                    role had already taken root in the field; there was an understanding of the
                    authority of the administrative officer and his or her relationship to the rest
                    of the Embassy. FSI helped us understand that relationship better and how an
                    administrative officer fitted into the Ambassador's team. My later experience
                    indicated that there was still a lot of work to be done in terms of enhancing
                    the role of administration abroad, but as time went along, it became much more
                    effective. But when I attended FSI, this process of understanding and acceptance
                    had already started. I was satisfied with the course and found it very useful
                    once I got to South Africa. Waterman tried to instill a “can do” attitude which
                    impressed me greatly. He tried to point out that once we were at post, we would
                    be very much more on our own because were far removed from Washington; our main
                    objective was to get the job done. That job was essentially to facilitate the
                    work of all the other Embassy staff members. He told us to keep the Department
                    informed of what we had done, but that we should not hesitate to get things
                    done, within the law, without asking for permission all the time. That view
                    became instilled in us and I was very pleased with that view because that was my
                    philosophy then and later on in my career. I always favored getting the job done
                    and worrying about the paper work later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You finished your FSI training in December, 1952 and went
                        to Pretoria as administrative officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SKOUFIS: That is correct. We flew to Pretoria after having spent the Christmas
                    holidays at home. We flew to Rome to pack our belongings, which had been left
                    there because our original travel orders assumed that we would be returning to
                    post. By that time, we had acquired a refrigerator and that was our sole
                    household furniture. We then flew to South Africa on a Pan American
                    Constellation plane, stopping at a couple of airports on the way. It was a long
                    flight in those days and we landed rather groggy. We were met by an Embassy
                    representative and taken to our hotel.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Prior to my arrival, the administrative work for the Embassy and the constituent
                    posts was handled by the administrative staff at the Consul General in
                    Johannesburg. As EUR changed administrative officers, it also changed the system
                    in South Africa. The main administrative office was moved to Pretoria which is
                    only about 25 miles from Johannesburg. The latter was the largest American post
                    in South Africa, so it became the “tail wagging the dog”. Ambassador Gallman was
                    not happy with his administrative staff being that far away, so during the
                    absence of an administrative officer, he and the Bureau made the shift. My
                    predecessor had been in Johannesburg and he was not replaced. So my first job
                    when I got to Pretoria was to make sure that the transfer of responsibilities
                    went smoothly and that all the administrative support functions in South Africa
                    were integrated. Pretoria got a general services officer, a budget and fiscal
                    officer and we ran the administrative function from there.</p>
                <p>South Africa at the time had a summer and a winter capital. That was an added
                    workload. It was also interesting because for example Pretoria had no consular
                    section. It was so close to Johannesburg that all consular functions were
                    handled from there. The Department, in its wisdom, had decided not to create a
                    consular district which would be serviced by the Embassy in Pretoria. There
                    really was no need because Johannesburg was servicing the whole area quite
                    adequately. All the passport work for Americans living in South Africa was
                    handled by Johannesburg. If someone walked into the Embassy for a consular
                    service, we sent him to Johannesburg. If the American citizen didn't want to do
                    that, he or she would have to wait for a consular officer to come to Pretoria,
                    which actually happened quite frequently. Then the service could be rendered. It
                    often had to do with notarization of a savings bond, which could not be cashed
                    without the certification of a consular officer. But since the consular officers
                    traveled back and forth so frequently, it was really not much of a hardship for
                    American citizens to travel 25 miles or wait for a day or two for the consular
                    officer to come to Pretoria.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>We had no problems with the integration of the administrative activities. When I
                    first arrived in South Africa, I encountered my first Department financial
                    crisis which would occur periodically. We had a change of administrations in
                    Washington, with Eisenhower being the new President and John Foster Dulles the
                    Secretary of State. Immediately, there was an economy wave. Certain programs
                    were eliminated, staffs were reduced and we were supposed to do more with less.
                    Before I had arrived, it had been the practice for the Ambassador, the Political
                    and the Economic Sections would move to Cape Town for the session of the South
                    African legislature. When the legislature was not in session, the staff would
                    move back to Pretoria. We had an Ambassador's residence in both places. The
                    maintenance of the Cape Town residence was the responsibility of our Consulate
                    General there. I used to go to Cape Town at the beginning of the legislative
                    session to make sure that all preparations had been made for the Ambassador and
                    the accompanying staff. This included not only housing, but also the office
                    work. We were fortunate that our Air Attach� had a plane at his disposal which
                    we would use to fly to Cape Town and back. He needed the flying time and we
                    needed the transportation. That is also the way we shuffled the mail pouch back
                    and forth. The pouch would come to Pretoria from Washington, where we would sort
                    the mail and transship those pieces that were addressed to the people in Cape
                    Town. If there was something urgent for the Ambassador, we had the capability of
                    wiring it to him by using the old-fashioned one-time pad system. Generally
                    speaking, those situations were few and far between. Most of the time, the pouch
                    system was adequate and the material was shipped on the Air Force attach�'s
                    plane.</p>
                <p>I was never in Cape Town for a whole legislative session. As I said, I went at
                    the beginning and sporadically thereafter. We didn't move any of the
                    administrative staff. After the economy drive started, we ceased sending whole
                    sections to Cape Town. Instead, if the legislature was to debate an economic
                    matter, we would send someone from the economic section to Cape Town for that
                    debate and then he or she would return to Pretoria. If the issue was political,
                    the chief of the Political Section would go or a member of his staff. The Deputy
                    Chief of Mission would always stay in Pretoria. There were times when we had
                    skeleton staffs both in Pretoria and Cape Town. The system worked
                    adequately.</p>
                <p>We had 4 constituent posts: Durban, Port Elizabeth, Cape Town and Johannesburg
                    plus the Embassy at Pretoria. It was a very interesting operation. It ran well,
                    partly because we were at the end of the communications line from Washington. We
                    got a pouch once a week on the Pan American flight. It was a big occasion; we
                    would go to the airport to meet the flight. Then we would be busy for two or
                    three days dealing with the material in the pouch; then we would reseal that
                    pouch for its flight back to Washington. It was a good operation; we had a
                    chance to play a lot of tennis and golf.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went to Pretoria, you had not had any State
                        Department administrative experience. What did you expect and what did you

                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>SKOUFIS: I had some trepidations, of course. It was very exciting to go to a new
                    post and being a section chief. First of all, I found a very cooperative staff.
                    The administrative staff was a mixture of old-timers and new blood, such as
                    myself, e.g. post war Foreign Service members. We established a very good
                    relationship. We had an interesting mixture in the Embassy as a whole. The
                    DCM—Mr. Robertson—was a political appointee, but the Ambassador was a career
                    officer. Robertson was Mrs. Shouse's (the Wolf Trap founder) son-in-law. It was
                    somewhat unusual for the Department to have political appointees as DCMs, but I
                    have served with two of them: one was the gentleman in Pretoria and the other
                    was Phil Kaiser in London. Of course, Phil had been an Ambassador before he was
                    assigned to London. Pretoria was also one of two posts I have served in which
                    had no consular section; the other was The Hague which was in Rotterdam consular
                    district. So I have some unique experiences in the Foreign Services.</p>
                <p>Robertson was a very interesting guy. He had been appointed by a Democratic
                    administration. When the Eisenhower administration took over, we assumed that
                    his appointment would lapse. But ambassador Gallman was recalled to Washington
                    to serve on the State Department selection boards, so Robertson became the
                    Charge'. While serving in that job, he presented me with a very delicate
                    dilemma. He decided that he would use the Ambassador's automobile. It was not a
                    big car, but it was the only real passenger vehicle we had. Ambassador Gallman
                    had left his wife and children in Pretoria with no transportation because she
                    didn't drive and the Embassy had always supported her. We did have two station
                    wagons in the motor pool. As you can see, Pretoria was a small operation. When
                    Robertson became Charge', he insisted on all the emoluments that went with the
                    Ambassador's office. He wanted to be able to fly the flag when he drove from
                    home to the office or to his appointments. That left poor Mrs. Gallman with no
                    transportation. I went to see her to tell her of the situation. She was a little
                    upset, but she was a veteran and so happy to be in South Africa with her husband
                    and children—the Ambassador had ben in London during World War II and more
                    recently, Ambassador in Poland, so that he had been separated from his family on
                    several occasions. So South Africa was a dream assignment for the Gallman family
                    because they could all be together. They were very nice. But the relationship
                    between the Ambassador and the DCM became strained quickly when Gallman learned
                    while in the U.S. what was going on in Pretoria. Fortunately, Mrs. Gallman told
                    her husband that we were taking good care of her. That helped my stock no end. I
                    had learned one of the first principles of an administrative officer quickly:
                    take care of the Ambassador and his family first. Also, two days after
                    Ambassador Gallman returned, Robertson was on his way back to the States since
                    the Republicans had decided not to keep him in the Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find any surprises in the management of the
                        Administrative Section?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>SKOUFIS: Not really. It was an easy task. It was very easy to do. One developed a
                    real feel and understanding for the role of the Foreign Service locals. The
                    South Africans were very competent. We had some black South Africans who ran the
                    motor pool and served as messengers. They were all very competent and well
                    educated. The administrative officer's role was very easy. The main problem was
                    the new emphasis on security. We didn't have any Marine guards. In addition to
                    my other duties, I was also the security officer (prior to my assignment, it was
                    probably the auxiliary responsibility for one of the junior members of the
                    Political or Economic Sections). We had to develop systems to keep the paper
                    flow moving while keeping it away from the local personnel. Prior to my arrival,
                    there had been less concern about what documents the locals had access to. The
                    whole atmosphere was quite relaxed. Also when the administrative work was done
                    primarily in Johannesburg, it was a fellow by the name of Neil Coney, who was
                    the administrative officer and one of his locals was responsible for the
                    handling of documents. Coney left shortly after my arrival.</p>
                <p>This new emphasis was an interesting experience for me. The whole Embassy staff
                    was in rented space—a certain number of offices in a public building. That
                    certainly was a challenge to provide good security. I assume the interest in
                    security in the early 1950s was due to Senator McCarthy's inquisitions. We all
                    began to be very conscious about security. The pouch was another problem. We had
                    a special arrangement with Pan American which flew a State Department courier to
                    Pretoria once a week, as I have mentioned. In addition, every Pan American
                    flight had a special pouch which was entrusted to the pilot according to the
                    rules which had to be delivered to an American official at the airport in
                    Pretoria. That American was either me or one of our two communicators or
                    sometimes the duty officer depending on the plane's arrival time. I can remember
                    very vividly sitting at the airport at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning patiently
                    waiting for the plane. It was due to arrive shortly before midnight, but because
                    we were at the end of the line and the plane laid over for two or three days to
                    rest the crew, we just had to wait because the pilot had to deliver it
                    personally to an American government official. It was quite a show when we did
                    receive the pouch.</p>
                <p>As a sidelight to my South African experience, I might just mention that
                    Robertson was replaced by Wilson C. (Bill) Flake. He had been a Foreign Service
                    Inspector and once he arrived, he really took over the management of the
                    Embassy. He was my boss on a regular basis; the DCM really took over the
                    management responsibilities and tighten the reins. We had a couple of Foreign
                    Service people who had been in the Service for many years who had become quite
                    casual about coming to work. They included as part of their working hours the
                    evening entertainment in which they had to participate and therefore would not
                    come to the office until 10 or 11 o'clock. The Embassy opened at 9 o'clock. So
                    Bill Flake began to have staff meetings at 9 o'clock. That was very hard on the
                    chief of the Political Section who found it very difficult to begin the working
                    day so early in the morning.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>We had no great difficulties in supervising the administrative work of the
                    constituent posts. Travel in South Africa was easy; when we couldn't go with the
                    Air Attach�, we used local air service. We would leave Pretoria, fly to Durban
                    where we exchanged pouches at the airport or we might spend the day there if
                    there was a particular problem; then could fly to Port Elizabeth, then to Cape
                    Town and back to Johannesburg all on the same flight if you wished. The South
                    African airline made the round trip in about 8 or 9 hours, so that we could
                    distribute the mail all in one day. We would do that frequently because someone
                    from the Consulate would meet us at the airport, where we would exchange
                    pouches. We could spend an hour with the representative of each Consulate, who
                    in some cases might have been the Consul General himself. That gave us an
                    opportunity to discuss mutual problems. Sometime, if we needed to spend more
                    time a post, we would ask the Air Attach� to give us a ride. He had intelligence
                    work to do so that we didn't disrupt his work, but just tagged along. Port
                    Elizabeth had a big GM plant in which automobiles were assembled. An American
                    tire company also had a plant there. So we used to go to Port Elizabeth quite
                    often. South Africa had right hand drive. It took me a long time to get the
                    Department to understand that it was cheaper for us to buy a car in South Africa
                    with right hand drive then to buy one in the U.S. with the steering wheel on the
                    wrong side. When I first mentioned the difficulties of the car system, the
                    Department volunteered to buy us right hand drive cars in Canada and ship them
                    to us. But we calculated that it was just cheaper to buy them in South Africa.
                    Finally, after much correspondence, I received authorization to buy cars locally
                    from GM. We would then fly to the factory and pick up our cars, either for the
                    Embassy of the constituent posts. We would sometime take the new car and send
                    our old one to the constituent post—we were just “breaking in” the new car. One
                    time, we were due to receive a new car for the Ambassador—in those days, they
                    were still mid-size sedans—from Canada. We sent one of our motor pool staff to
                    Cape Town to pick it up from the docks. That was a long drive which required an
                    overnight stop somewhere. Unfortunately, the driver rolled the car over; he was
                    not hurt, but the car was totalled. So we had to wait another six months before
                    another car was shipped. But in the meantime, I went to my friends in GM and got
                    them to lend us a car while we waited for a new one. That made the Ambassador
                    very happy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall what your impressions of State Department
                        administration was by the time you completed your tour in South Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>SKOUFIS: I am hazy on that. My liaison with the Department was essentially
                    through the Bureau of European Affairs. That Bureau was very supportive. With
                    some effort, I managed to have FBO to include South Africa on its inspection
                    tours of African posts. They had never visited South Africa after World War II,
                    despite the fact that we had acquired some property with some surplus British
                    local currency generated by lend-Lease and other assistance programs. FBO had
                    never seen the properties; I don't know who bought them, but we had deeds of
                    sale. Finally, Charlie Osborne came; he was the man in charge of the African
                    region for FBO and he surveyed the properties. We were trying very hard to get a
                    site for a new Embassy because we had reached capacity in the rented quarters
                    that we were occupying. We had residences for the Ambassador, the DCM and for
                    the Consul Generals in the constituent posts.</p>
                <p>I think EUR gave us support because we were such a small operation compared to
                    Paris, London or Rome and therefore didn't make many demands on it. I could
                    generally get what I needed. My main discussions with Washington was about
                    buildings which fell in the province of FBO. We needed to update some of the
                    properties; the Ambassador wanted a tennis court, etc. We wrote Washington—in
                    those days, you never called. I conducted some business with Herman Pollack, who
                    was the deputy Executive Director of EUR. He was always very helpful.</p>
                <p>I might just finish the story of my promotions. You will recall that that was a
                    very sore subject with me since I had been frozen at the same level for five
                    years. After the assignment to Pretoria, that changed and I think I was promoted
                    three times in one year to FSS-5. I also became “Wristonized” and became an
                    FSO-4. The DCM gave me my oral examination. By that time, Ambassador Tom Wailes
                    had arrived. He had been chief of personnel and Inspector General. It was a time
                    of transition for the Department. Personnel was moved and given to Scott McLeod
                    who became responsible for it, security and consular affairs. Wailes was a fine
                    person to work for and was very helpful. Flake had left and the job was still
                    empty when I left. Glen Wolfe came later to replace Flake. But while the DCM
                    position was unfilled, I worked closely with the Ambassador and had a very good
                    relationship with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That brings us to 1955. You were then assigned to the
                        Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SKOUFIS: I was slated to return to the Department after my Pretoria tour. I was
                    one of the first overseas people to swap jobs with someone in the Department.
                    That was a new program resulting from the Wriston Committee's work. I was
                    assigned to be the deputy Executive Director in the Bureau of Security and
                    Consular Affairs. Pete Martin was the Executive Director. Scott McLeod was of
                    course the Assistant Secretary. I replaced Margaret Fagan, who had been in the
                    Department for many years; she had become an FSO and went to Geneva as a
                    consular officer.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>The assignment came out of the blue; I had not sought it and it came as a
                    surprise. Wailes called me to his office one day and read me the cable that he
                    had received about my next assignment. He said' “Pete, you have either done
                    something wrong or something right. They want you to work in SCA!”. At that
                    time, SCA was of course very controversial with McLeod in charge. I had learned
                    later that Fagan was so anxious to leave Washington that she got on the back of
                    the personnel people to find a quick replacement and I was the first available.
                    Furthermore, since we didn't have any children, we were the easiest people to
                    move quickly—one or two weeks and we were ready to go. No kids in school; no
                    impediments of any kind. Just pick up our few belongings and go. That occurred
                    to us a couple of times during my service.</p>
                <p>So I came back to Washington and went to work for SCA. I had to postpone my leave
                    because there was a crisis of some sort at the time. I had very close contact
                    with Scott McLeod. Bob Cartwright was his deputy and Harris Houston came later
                    in the front office. They were all “outsiders”; they had worked for the FBI or
                    in Congress. McLeod was a very strong personality. He was very interesting, very
                    positive in his thinking. We all had to “sign in” in the morning and “sign out”
                    at night, just as was done in the FBI starting in the J. Edgar Hoover's days.
                    McLeod always wanted to know where you were. The executive office was one of the
                    first you passed in the executive corridor; McLeod's office was at the end of
                    the corridor. Gwen Lewis was his personal assistant. He was very supportive of
                    the executive director's office; we leaned on him quite a bit. Most of our work
                    had to do with security clearances and with people being fired. Dennis Flynn was
                    in charge of the security operations. McLeod provided the political input.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>We were hiring a lot of people for the Refugee Relief Program (RRP). Congressman
                    Walters was the “god-father” of the program. Pierce Garrety was in charge of the
                    RRP. The executive director office was to provide support for the new program.
                    We had to deal with the congressional pressures. McLeod was a very political
                    animal since he had worked as the administrative assistant to Senator Styles
                    Bridges of New Hampshire. So he had a wide range of contacts on the Hill, none
                    of whom ever hesitated to call him on an immigration or passport problem or if
                    someone wanted a job with the RRP, which was one of the few activities in the
                    Department which did not require Civil or Foreign Service status. We tried to
                    facilitate operations. We could employ people for the RRP without going through
                    the usual long and tedious security clearance process if the Secretary of State
                    was willing to issue a waiver. A number of our new recruits were needed
                    immediately. It was up to our office to get all the paper work done for the
                    waiver. First, we used to send to Ambassador Loy Henderson, who was then the
                    Deputy Under Secretary for Administration. Then we were instructed to bypass him
                    and go directly to the Secretary. The waivers ended up in the hands of two very
                    competent people in the Secretary's office: Bill Macomber, who was a special
                    assistant at the time, and John Haynes. These two guys were the “spear carriers”
                    for the Secretary on these issues. They would resist all the pressures that we
                    put on to get one of these appointments through; it turned out that half or more
                    of these appointments had been stimulated by Secretary Dulles; he would make a
                    deal to bring the person on to the payroll. We would tell that to the special
                    assistants and also tell them they should not get upset with the messengers. The
                    problems were initiated in their own office. The whole process gave me a great
                    insight into the politics of the Department; it was quite a revelation for a
                    country boy from Maine to see how the power structure of the Department and the
                    government as a whole really worked.</p>
                <p>Pete Martin left the Service about a year after I reported to SCA. So I was the
                    acting Executive Director, as an FSO-4 (soon to be moved down to FSO-5 when the
                    grade structure was redone, although I was promoted back to FSO-4 a year later).
                    It was an interesting assignment because it coincided with Scott McLeod getting
                    into the middle of a fight between Frances Knight, Director of the Passport
                    Office and Congressman John Rooney, chairman of the House's appropriations
                    subcommittee which had jurisdiction over the Department's funds. The two just
                    didn't get along. It was fascinating to be in the middle. McLeod was of course
                    also involved, but he was more skillful than I was; he kept ducking and used to
                    sent the problems to me because most of the issues dealt with the funding of the
                    Passport Office—new offices, updated equipment, etc. That fight went on for
                    years and even Loy Henderson became involved as Deputy Under Secretary for
                    Administration. Miss Knight would take her case to him. Then she would go to the
                    Hill to testify—I used to go with her because I was the Bureau's chief budget
                    officer, which essentially meant that I would put a budget together based on the
                    requests of the various offices—Passport, Visa, Consular Services, Security,
                    etc. My main role was to consolidate it all, run it through the Personnel and
                    the Budget offices (Ed Crouch and Fred Irving) and then accompany the Office
                    heads when they testified.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Miss Knight went one year and got into a confrontation with Rooney, which
                    included name-calling. The issue was the New York Passport Office. Miss Knight
                    wanted to fire some of the people in that office; it turned out that the people
                    on her “hit” list were those that Rooney had put there. That was a prolonged
                    dispute. As a result, Miss Knight refused to testify again; she wouldn't appear
                    before Rooney and would send her deputy or someone else. Rooney would suspend
                    the hearings; he wanted Miss Knight present. We would tell the Chairman that she
                    wasn't coming; he would say “O.K., then there will be no hearings”. Then Mr
                    McLeod would have to become involved. He would call Rooney and tell him that
                    Miss Knight would no not show up. That allowed the Republicans to make some
                    noise—Miss Knight was close to the Republicans on the Hill. Rooney would cut the
                    Passport's Office request. For example, he would deny money for new electric
                    typewriters for that Office. Those were the days when “automation” meant moving
                    from manual to electric typewriters.</p>
                <p>Then there was the issue of moving the Passport Office to a new location. Tom
                    Estes, as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Operations, got involved. We had to go
                    back to see Rooney. Miss Knight didn't want to move out of the State
                    Department's building, even if her staff had to move to the Maiatico Building.
                    She finally was persuaded to move with her staff, but it took a lot of effort.
                    After she got there and had been there for a while, the landlord wanted her out
                    because she was such a nuisance. That was the life of the Executive Director; it
                    was a tremendous education for me in the politics of the Department and trying
                    to get along with a great variety of people.</p>
                <p>Working for McLeod was sometimes a negative factor. But eventually, people began
                    to understand my role, even though it included the very unpleasant task of
                    firing people for security reasons. I would have to call Personnel to pass on
                    the bad news. In Personnel, the cases were handled by an officer by the name of
                    Pete Szluk. We used to call him “the social conscience of the State Department”.
                    He was the “hatchet man”. Any time Security developed an adverse case, it would
                    be sent to us for review to make sure that all the appropriate offices and
                    officials had been contacted to make sure that there were no special angles that
                    we should be aware of. If Security felt that an employee had to be discharged,
                    it was Pete Szluk who had to inform him or her. But the whole period was very
                    unpleasant, although being part of the process wasn't too bad. Most of my role
                    concerned getting various clearances from other offices around the Department.
                    For example, if there was a problem in NEA, it would be my responsibility to
                    discuss it with the Executive Director so that he would know what was going to
                    happen. Most of the cases dealt with employees, but sometimes we would have
                    difficulties with a proposed appointment. I used to represent the Bureau on the
                    “Appointments and Assignments Board” which was run by Personnel. Every consular
                    assignment had to be approved by SCA. There were a lot of them. We of course had
                    a great interest in a lot of consular posts where the visa workload was very
                    heavy, but there were a lot of assignments to small posts which were of no great
                    consequence. As long as the officer passed security clearance, we really didn't
                    care. Occasionally, we would object to an assignment.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>We did have a significant problem, which resulted from the Wriston program. There
                    were a number of officers who had been appointed in the early '30s and who had
                    spent their whole careers in small consular posts overseas. There have been
                    20-30 of these officers. They were getting along in age and had reached the
                    mid-career levels of the Service. Mr. Henderson and the Personnel Office felt it
                    was time for these people to be assigned to Washington, as recommended by the
                    Wriston Committee. But no Office in Washington wanted them. They didn't fit into
                    the Regional Bureaus who had no positions for consular specialists. They weren't
                    economists or politico-military or public affairs experts, so that the
                    Functional Bureaus had no assignment for them. SCA had a few jobs, but not many,
                    because most of our employees were Civil Servants who did not move from their
                    jobs. They had not joined the Wriston program and were therefore immobile. They
                    were not forced to become available for world-wide service and they chose in
                    fact to remain where they were. So they filled most of the positions that these
                    Foreign Service consular people could have occupied. So I kept getting heat from
                    Personnel and finally from Henderson's office to find jobs for these consular
                    types. There weren't any in SCA. So we would go back to them and tell them that
                    they had to produce assignments for them; we couldn't. There was pressure on us
                    to get the Civil Service people to join the Wriston program so that they could
                    be sent overseas. But we didn't really succeed to any major extent. There were
                    no inducements; these people were not attracted by the emoluments of the Foreign
                    Service. They had been in the Department for a long, long time and were
                    satisfied to remain in their present positions. Some would stipulate that they
                    would only go to certain countries; e.g. Canada. Sometimes, we might actually
                    find a job in Canada for one of these people. We put a couple into Mexican
                    border posts. But these assignments were few and far between.</p>
                <p>Allen Donaldson was the head of the Office of Special Consular Services, which
                    worried about protection and welfare of private American citizens abroad. There
                    were a lot of “old timers” in that Office. The Director of the Visa Office was a
                    Foreign Service officer, but below him were also a lot of “old timers”. The
                    Passport Office wouldn't even consider any of the Foreign Service people. It did
                    have a very small Foreign Affairs Section, but it may have had only three
                    positions. Otherwise, none of the jobs in the Passport Office were considered
                    suitable for Foreign Service people. The Wriston program didn't really work in
                    SCA.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us a little bit of your relationship with Frances
                        Knight.</hi>

                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>SKOUFIS: I had an interesting relationship with her. In the first place, she
                    viewed the world as “we” and “they”. It took me an awful long time to convince
                    her that I didn't have any personal axes to grind and that when I said
                    something, it was most likely to be on behalf of someone else—either Mr. McLeod
                    or Mr. Cartwright. I had no personal interest in most of the requests or
                    instructions. She appreciated that approach; she was an interesting person in
                    that respect. I would sometime go to the Passport Office and talk to some of her
                    staff. She told very early in my tenure that she didn't want me to do that
                    unless she knew what I was going to talk about. I had to see or talk to her
                    first. Most of my dealings were on small issues such as getting necessary data
                    so that I could put a budget together. I used to have to tell her that there was
                    no possibility of getting her any money unless I had the supporting data. She
                    finally understood that; she was after all a consummate bureaucrat. One of the
                    problems was that most of the data was in the hands of an employee who had been
                    employed by Mrs. Shipley, who was Miss Knight's predecessor. So Frances wasn't
                    sure he could trust him. But Miss Knight and I developed a relationship which
                    allowed me to call her from time to time if I needed to have something done. I
                    figured there was no use calling her Office because she would be told of my call
                    and would then phone me to ask why I hadn't gone through her. When I pointed out
                    that my requests were often for trivia which wasn't worth her time, she would
                    say that she didn't care what it was; she wanted to know what we in the front
                    office were up to. So I would promise that I would call her the next time. Miss
                    Knight had an assistant—Winnie Fitzsimmons—who did the personnel work for the
                    Passport Office. We got along very well. Eventually, Miss Knight and I became
                    good friends; whenever I would come home from an overseas assignment, I would
                    drop in to see her. She always remembered that and used to say that I was the
                    only person in the SCA front office that she liked. She felt that all the other
                    people were against her.</p>
                <p>Miss Knight had a very interesting relationship with Mr. Henderson. It had some
                    conflict in it because of her relationship with Congress and particularly with
                    Rooney and his colleagues. One time, Mr. Henderson himself called; usually the
                    call would come from one of his assistants, Earl Sohm or Don Zook. They would
                    tell me that Miss Knight had sent something to Mr. Henderson that probably had
                    not been seen by the SCA front office. They would tell me that Mr. Henderson did
                    not want to read it until it had gotten Mr. McLeod's approval. They would sent
                    the paper back to me; I would then take it to McLeod and discuss it with him; he
                    would then usually initial it and then we would return it to Mr. Henderson's
                    office. McLeod didn't really care; most often he just didn't want to get
                    involved. He preferred to keep his head down when the firing began.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>As I said, Loy Henderson called me one day wanting to know why I permitted Miss
                    Knight to by-pass the SCA front office. He asked: “Are you not her boss?”. I
                    told him that I was not and that Mr. McLeod was in charge of SCA. Henderson then
                    told me he wanted McLeod to see a certain memorandum written by Miss Knight. I
                    assured Mr. Henderson that I would see to it that Mr. McLeod would see it. One
                    interesting aspect of the Knight-McLeod relationship was that both had the same
                    base of political support. She was supported primarily by Senator Bridges, a
                    Republican from New Hampshire, for whom McLeod had worked. She got the job in
                    the Department in the first place through Bridges and McLeod's interventions.
                    That is how she replaced Mrs. Shipley. Frances Knight also had a very good
                    relationship with Sherman Adams of the White House staff. She could bring
                    pressure to bear on the Department through that channel. She used that channel
                    not infrequently. Then she had other Hill supporters.</p>
                <p>Despite the fact that Miss Knight and McLeod had the same supporters, they were
                    not good co-workers. We often wondered whether Miss Knight did not have
                    aspiration to supplant McLeod. I was in SCA for three years, during which Mr.
                    McLeod received an appointment as Ambassador to Ireland. Then the speculation
                    was rife with Miss Knight being the leading candidate for the SCA
                    Administrator's job.</p>
                <p>There was another incident that is worth recalling. This dealt with a leak about
                    Ambassador Bohlen being nominated to another ambassadorship. The question arose
                    as to the source of the leak. Dulles and Eisenhower both were criticizedfor the
                    nomination because there was some opposition to Ambassador Bohlen on the Hill.
                    Bohlen had been Ambassador to Moscow and perhaps that was the reason for the
                    opposition. In any case, there was some suspicion that it was Mr. McLeod who had
                    leaked the nomination to the Hill. But to cover everyone's tail, we all had to
                    sign a sworn statement that we were not the source of the leak. Anyone who had
                    knowledge of the nomination—e.g. anyone who had seen the agr�ment or anyone who
                    had handled any papers relating to the nomination—had to sign such document. But
                    it was all very embarrassing because of the suspicions about Mr. McLeod's
                    involvement. The whole Bureau was scared that Mr. McLeod might lose his job
                    because of this incident that had infuriated President Eisenhower. Dulles was
                    embarrassed that Congress had gotten the word through a leak and even worse, may
                    have been surreptitiously been informed by the Department's chief of security.
                    The leaker was never found of course. But Mr. McLeod soon thereafter was
                    appointed to Ireland. It was a very controversial appointment. The Senate was
                    Democratic during the second half of Eisenhower's term. The Chairman of the
                    Foreign Relations Committee was William Fulbright and there was concern that he
                    might block the nomination. It was a close call. My role was deliver documents
                    to the various parties involved. Finally, the Committee was to vote and Mr.
                    McLeod told me to go to stand in the corridor outside the Committee room and to
                    call him if I picked up any information.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>In fact, I did get some news. That was exciting. I got the word that Lyndon
                    Johnson would vote for McLeod and that was the swing vote that made the
                    difference. We learned later that Johnson had called McLeod to tell him that he
                    was going to vote for him. That was politics; there may well have been a
                    trade-off of some kind. After McLeod was confirmed, he started his preparations
                    for the assignment during which he and the Foreign Relations Committee learned
                    that some Irish farmer had a historical right to graze his live-stock on the
                    grounds of the American Embassy in Dublin. The Embassy was on a large estate
                    called Phoenix Park and apparently the farmer had been granted grazing rights or
                    they may have come with the purchase of the estate. The farmer did pay a token
                    sum for the privilege. Then the question arose concerning what had happened to
                    the grazing fees. No one seemed to know who had received and how it was disposed
                    of. There was a big to do and I was given the assignment to find out what had
                    happened to that money. I went all over the Department and particularly EUR to
                    find this miserly sum. We looked at all the books; apparently no one had ever
                    recorded the fee as a receipt. What had happened of course was that the farmer
                    had paid the fee in cash and the Embassy had used as a sort of “slush” fund. In
                    fact, the farmer was providing a service by keeping the grass short.</p>
                <p>John Rooney got involved in the “scandal”. He raised the issue during one of our
                    budget hearings. He wanted the money deposited in “Miscellaneous Receipts”. So
                    thereafter, the small sum was duly credited to “Miscellaneous Receipts” like all
                    other fees. There was a lot to do about a tiny sum.</p>
                <p>Another time, I was on the Hill accompanying our SCA witnesses to some Rooney
                    hearings. At the same time, the Senate was holding hearings on the question of
                    the U.S. Representative to the U.N. and the apartment that was leased by the
                    Department at the Waldorf-Astoria. That apartment cost $1,500 per month or
                    $18,000 per annum. Secretary Dulles himself had to testify on this. The
                    Committee Chairman, Lyndon Johnson, was having a lot of fun teasing Dulles about
                    this “gross expenditure”. We learned later that this hearing was part of a
                    pre-designed scenario. The Secretary had used a wrong figure during his
                    testimony. Eddie Crouch, who was the Department's budget officer at the time,
                    corrected the Secretary out loud. The Secretary turned around and asked: “Are
                    you testifying or am I?” in very cold terms. Poor Eddie changed colors several
                    times. His intervention was not worth it, but it changed Eddie's demeanor
                    thereafter because he had been so embarrassed by the Secretary's comment. Of
                    course, the U.N. Representative at the time was Henry Cabot Lodge who had
                    already cleared the lease with his old friend, Lyndon B. Johnson. The hearings
                    were just for show; the substance had been agreed to long before. It was a very
                    expensive lease, although today that annual rent may be just enough to cover a
                    week's costs.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>As I said, I stayed in SCA for three years. I came to the conclusion that SCA in
                    those days was not a manageable bureau. The constituent offices were too
                    disparate. When I first came to the Bureau, the Personnel Office was part of it.
                    As a matter of fact. when McLeod was appointed, he was also made the head of
                    administration. George Wilson was McLeod's special assistant for personnel and
                    he sort of ran the Personnel Office. The head of Security was Denny Flynn. The
                    consular sections were totally unrelated to either personnel or security. I
                    didn't personally understand the security implications of consular work and why
                    the two functions had to be together in one bureau. I believe they were put
                    together as a matter of convenience. Administration was the first function to be
                    taken away from SCA followed soon thereafter by personnel, with Tom Wailes being
                    designated as Assistant Secretary for Personnel and Administration in 1954. What
                    was left was called the Bureau of Inspection, Security and Consular Affairs.
                    Later, in 1962, During Abba Schwartz' tenure, the security function was
                    transferred out of the bureau and finally in 1977, the head of the Bureau became
                    an Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs.</p>
                <p>The Bureau was too disparate and too difficult to manage. There were too many
                    layers above the Administrator and too many layers below him. The layers above
                    him consisted of the assistant Secretary for Administration, the Under Secretary
                    for Administration and the Secretary's Office. Everybody was in the act. It was
                    very messy and not at all clear. McLeod functioned well only because of his
                    strong political support. But there were problems in running the Bureau and in
                    coordinating with other parts of the Department. I was not impressed by the
                    efficacy of SCA although it was staffed with some very good people—Roland Welsh,
                    the head of the visa office, Dennis Flynn, who had a very difficult job as head
                    of the security office—he was there during most of the McCarthy period which was
                    a tough times for them. I gained a great of deal of insight into how the
                    Department worked, how various pressures were applied to it, how different parts
                    of the Department interacted. That was probably my most valuable experience of
                    my career in the Department partly because of the wide range of contacts I was
                    able to make partly because what I was able to learn about the inter-play of
                    forces. I became impressed by how the strength of an individual's personality
                    influenced the operations of a particular office. If the head was a good
                    operator, he was able to project a greater role for himself and his subordinates
                    than might have been assumed by an organization chart. It was very interesting
                    to observe and a good lesson to learn for an administrator. You could notice
                    where vacuums occurred. For example, EUR was a very good bureau; it knew what it
                    was doing. When you went to EUR, you knew you were dealing with pros. NEA was
                    good; Barr Washburn had a good team there. Africa was still then fragmented
                    between EUR (the colonies) and NEA (North Africa), but in any case, we didn't
                    have many consular people in African and therefore not many concerns. I don't
                    remember much about ARA either nor FE. But I certainly was impressed with EUR,
                    which led me eventually to getting an assignment in that region.</p>

                <p>SKOUFIS: I was called one day by Personnel and asked whether I was interested in
                    being assigned to The Hague. I had served three years in Washington. I was due
                    for an overseas assignment. I had never indicated any preference for Holland. I
                    had expressed an interest in going overseas since if I were to be in the Foreign
                    Service, I should be abroad. I really didn't care much an assignment in
                    Washington, although, as I said, the SCA assignment had been very interesting.
                    McLeod went to Ireland and we had a new Administrator, Robert O'Connor, who had
                    been one of Dulles' assistants. He ran it well, although he was not as skillful
                    as his predecessor on political relationships.</p>
                <p>So one day, The Hague assignment came open and Personnel asked me whether I was
                    interested. I said that would be fine and off we went. I had to find a
                    replacement for myself in SCA because that was the only way the Bureau would
                    release me.</p>
                <p>The Ambassador in the Netherlands was Philip Young, a political appointment who
                    had been the Dean of the Graduate School of Business Administration at Columbia
                    University when Eisenhower was President of that institution. Young was brought
                    to Washington as the personnel director for the White House. He supervised the
                    Civil Service Commission and was involved in all the high level appointments and
                    in the development of the government's personnel policies. As a reward, he was
                    later appointed as Ambassador to the Netherlands. The DCM at the time was
                    Herbert Failes. By the time of my appointment I was an FSO-4.</p>
                <p>The job had more substance than my job in Pretoria. Almost as soon as I arrived,
                    I became involved in a building project because the U.S. government was in the
                    process of building a new chancery. We had been tenants of the Shell Company in
                    the “Essobau” since the end of World War II. The new premises were being
                    constructed right downtown. It was completed about a year after I got there and
                    we moved into the new building. It was a very lovely Chancery building.</p>
                <p>We had an extensive agricultural program as well as a very active USIA program.
                    Both required considerable administrative support. Our agricultural experts were
                    involved primarily in expanding our markets for US agricultural products—selling
                    chickens and chicken feed while buying tulips and bulbs from the Dutch. There
                    were a lot of people running around Holland at the time on promotional
                    efforts—wheat promoters, rice growers. All of these industries had regional
                    promotional offices in The Hague, all under the umbrella of the Department of
                    Agriculture.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>We had two consular posts in Holland—Rotterdam and Amsterdam. We also had a big
                    MAAG staff in Holland, primarily because of the NATO bases build up including
                    port facilities for our ships and air bases in the western part of Holland. We
                    provided administrative support to the MAAG until they outgrew us. It had a
                    two-star admiral in charge and finally we just couldn't provide all the services
                    they required. My job then became one of liaison between the MAAG and the Dutch
                    Protocol Office which was responsible for privileges and immunities. Much of the
                    day-to-day matters were handled by the MAAG itself, but we were able to use
                    their APO and Commissary facilities. We were going to make sure that the Embassy
                    staff would not be denied access to those facilities.</p>
                <p>While I was there, the Department went through another of those “economy” drives.
                    We came under pressure to cut down the cost of our operations. If you look at a
                    map, you can put a dime on it and cover all three Dutch posts. So we had to cut
                    one post. First of all, the Ambassador recommended that the MAAG be cut out;
                    there was one in Denmark, one in Holland an one in Belgium. At his request, I
                    found out that we had over a thousand military people in these three countries.
                    Those were days when flag-rank officers had military household staff, drivers,
                    etc. The Ambassador wrote a long despatch; having been in personnel operations,
                    he knew how to present a good case. He recommended that there be only one MAAG
                    to cover all three countries, preferably stationed in Holland because it was the
                    middle country. He didn't get any response for a while; then all of a sudden the
                    whole world came down on us, primarily from the Pentagon which wanted to know
                    what we were doing minding their business. We were accused of not “seeing the
                    big picture” and not understanding why the MAAG were there. The Chief of Naval
                    Operations came to the Hague; he was a good friend of the Ambassador. One day,
                    we had a big staff meeting with the CNO. He said that he couldn't agree more
                    with the Ambassador's logic, but that he was in charge of the U.S. Navy and had
                    to find some place for the Navy people then stationed in Holland. He said he
                    could send them to Kansas or California or Arizona or Maine, but all of his U.S.
                    facilities were full and he had no other place to put them. He wanted to know
                    what to do with fire trucks when there was no fire; you had to keep them because
                    a fire might break out at sometime. And that is the way he asked us to look at
                    the Navy people in the MAAGs; they had to be stationed somewhere and Holland was
                    a good post. So we lost that battle in a hurry.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>But the Department insisted that some savings be made. We had two Army teams in
                    the Embassy: one was buying food in Holland for the troops in Germany and around
                    Europe; they had about ten guys for whom we were providing space. We suggested
                    that they not need to be stationed in The Hague; they could be in Germany and
                    travel to Holland periodically. That suggestion brought the whole Army down on
                    our heads. Then we suggested that a group from the Agriculture Department be
                    eliminated. That was a plant inspection group, primarily for tulip bulbs, Years
                    earlier, the Dutch used to export bulbs to the U.S. where they had be
                    quarantined for a period in New Jersey. Some had been condemned and dumped into
                    the ocean. The Dutch had already paid for the transportation and therefore
                    incurred a substantial loss. That episode brought forth the idea of a
                    pre-shipment inspection to be done in Holland. The Dutch were willing to pay and
                    reimbursed Agriculture for the cost of maintaining American inspectors in
                    Holland. We didn't know of that arrangement; all we knew was that Agriculture as
                    maintaining an American staff in Holland. So we learned that this arrangement
                    had been agreed upon at a fairly high level and that it was cheaper for the U.S.
                    to keep their inspectors in Holland than having them in the U.S. It also saved
                    the Dutch from potential losses. Furthermore, as a spin-off, all the tulip beds
                    on U.S. government property in Holland got new bulbs every year from the Dutch
                    Tulip Growers Association. Same with the White House. So we didn't get anywhere
                    with the suggestion of eliminating the American Agriculture inspectors in
                    Holland.</p>
                <p>There were all the sales associations that opposed any cuts. They kept pointing
                    out the importance of agricultural sales to our balance-of-payments. So we
                    couldn't get rid of the Wheat or Rice Growers Associations representatives. We
                    were then left with only one option: closing a post. We hemmed and hawed and did
                    a lot of work and concluded that Rotterdam was the best prospect. We couldn't
                    close Amsterdam, which, although smaller and less significant in terms of
                    consular workload, is really the capital of the Netherlands. The Queen's Palace
                    was there; the Royal family had another palace there. For most people, Amsterdam
                    is the capital of the Netherlands. The Hague was the seat of government, 25
                    miles down the road. We couldn't obviously close the Embassy and we had to keep
                    Amsterdam because that was where the Queen lived. So it had to be Rotterdam.</p>
                <p>We decided that when Rotterdam was closed we would move the consular operations
                    to The Hague; that is why I was anxious to move some of the military personnel
                    out of the Chancery. The consular operation was a sizeable one and a very busy
                    one. There were a lot of Americans in the Netherlands—shipping and oil
                    companies. The workload was substantial. ARAMCO had its headquarters in Holland
                    at the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>About a month after our recommendations were submitted—and the Ambassador was
                    pleased that he had gotten this monkey off his back—Frank Molloy, then the
                    director for the Office for Western European Affairs, came to The Hague. He
                    called us into a meeting behind closed doors and whispered: “The Department is
                    not paying anything for Rotterdam. The Agency is paying for it all”. So
                    Rotterdam had never cost the Department a single nickel. The Agency wanted it
                    open because it could monitor all the incoming and outgoing shipments. For
                    example, the Russians were buying oil there and shipping it home. Rotterdam was
                    an important intelligence post for the CIA, which subsidized much of not all of
                    the costs of maintaining that post. We all got a big laugh out of that
                    revelation. We had struck out again! We of course knew that the Agency had
                    operations in Holland; its headquarters were in the Embassy in The Hague. I knew
                    who was a CIA man in the Embassy, but I didn't know their people in the
                    consulates. I certainly didn't know anything about the funding arrangement for
                    Rotterdam. I suspect that even the Ambassador didn't have full knowledge of all
                    the CIA activities in Holland; he certainly didn't know about the Rotterdam
                    arrangements. Although I was not involved, I understand that the same situation
                    cropped up for Antwerp which was also supposed to close, but didn't because, as
                    I understood it, of Agency financing. It was clear that in both cases, it was
                    necessary to maintain a U.S. presence and that decisions to do so were made at
                    relatively high levels of the U.S. government.</p>
                <p>It was interesting how also I learned about the Rotterdam situation. We were
                    housed in rented space on land that we owned and we were considering an office
                    building. The Dutch government had been quite generous with us after World War
                    II in terms of allocating space for our offices. All that we had occupied before
                    the war had been blown up or lost in some fashion. But the Dutch made space
                    available to us in downtown The Hague for the Embassy.</p>
                <p>In Rotterdam, either the city or the national government provided some land at
                    concessionary prices or perhaps even as a gift in gratitude for the role the
                    U.S. played in World War II. The lot stood empty for many years and the Dutch
                    were beginning to pressure on us to build on it; it was very valuable land right
                    in the middle of the city which was growing around it. So while I was still in
                    The Hague, an architect came over and developed a building concept. But
                    Washington for some reason or other, backed off and didn't build. We could never
                    understand why nothing would move. The City of Rotterdam had given its approval
                    to the architect's sketches. By the time I left in 1961, I thought for sure that
                    we would build in Rotterdam. I learned later that there had been no intention to
                    build there; we still haven't done so. I don't know what happened to the
                    property.</p>
                <p>Young's tour was up because the Republicans had lost the election and it was time
                    for another U.S. government. John F. Kennedy was elected and the whole issue of
                    reducing U.S. government expenditures in the Netherlands came to an end. It was
                    all a big joke. We had lived with the suspense for such a long time. That and
                    moving into the new building were the two major activities for those years.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>All in all, my assignment to The Hague was very interesting. Soon after taking
                    office, President Kennedy appointed John Rice to be the new Ambassador. He had
                    been chairman of the Democratic Committee in Pennsylvania. He turned out to be a
                    very nice guy. He was also very wealthy; he owned a big apple operation outside
                    of Harrisburg—Biglersville. By the time he arrived, we were already settled in
                    the new building. He was a very good Ambassador. The DCM was Dick Service, with
                    whom I had a very good working relationship. He was John Service's brother (of
                    McCarthy fame).</p>
                <p>I was fortunate in The Hague in that I had a very good staff. In general, the
                    staff there was very interesting. It was a very active post. The activities of
                    the port of Rotterdam were growing by leaps and bounds, giving our commercial
                    people a lot of work. Our agriculture exporters used it. Dupont established an
                    operation there.</p>
                <p>My principle challenges were the coordination of the administrative activities of
                    the other agencies, making sure that we were providing the necessary support.
                    With the move into a new building, we had to sort out all the support activities
                    and make sure that all got what was necessary. We had of course the usual
                    problem of discrepancy of treatment among personnel of various agencies. I had a
                    good working relationship with the Agriculture Attach� (Bob Reid from Kansas),
                    who had been the former editor of “Country Gentleman”. He was also a political
                    appointee and didn't have much of an understanding about U.S. foreign relations
                    and the activities of the Foreign Service or even of the Agricultural Service.
                    In those days, we had to get the other agencies' representatives to agree to a
                    sort of contractual arrangement which spelled out all the services that the
                    Embassy would render and the costs of each. Most of the other agencies would
                    yell, but I could always go to Bob Reid, tell him about the calculations and an
                    hour later he would call me to tell me that he had signed off on the dotted
                    line. He used to say: “Gee, you guys charge a lot for going to the airport!”.
                    Then we would get into a discussion whether it was cheaper for Agriculture to
                    buy its own car and so on. But in the final analysis, he was a good guy and
                    would agree to our estimates. We had a good relationship.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>We had a couple of amusing incidents while I was in The Hague. One had to do with
                    the consular office. My office was on the ground floor of the Chancery. One day,
                    a nice lady walked into our building with a handful of U.S. government bonds
                    that she wanted notarized so that they could be cashed. The receptionist was
                    accustomed to sending anyone she could not deal with to the Administrative
                    office which was right down the corridor from her. My secretary was out' so I
                    came out of my office and introduced myself to the lady. She said that she
                    wanted the bonds notarized. I told her that she would have to go to Rotterdam
                    because there was no U.S. consular service in the Embassy. We didn't have any
                    authorized notary nor the necessary stamps. She got mad as hell. I told her how
                    to get to Rotterdam which was very easy because you could do it by trolley car
                    at very cheap price. After pronouncing a few unkind words, she finally left.
                    Later I got a call from Washington telling me that some Member of Congress was
                    on the Department's back because some lady couldn't get any consular services
                    from the Embassy, The Hague. Who ever called me wanted to know what all the
                    people in the building were doing and why I couldn't put my name on a document.
                    My answer obviously did not satisfy the caller. The Department was not much
                    help. I finally had to get the Consulate General in Rotterdam to send me a seal;
                    I had the exequatur on my wall which made me a consular officer of the United
                    States. I felt that if I could have a stamp, I could do the rest legally. The
                    C.G. said that I had to have a record of fees, so I asked him for a page from
                    his book, which I would send every time I collected a fee for services rendered.
                    We finally worked it all out, but of course there was never another case when I
                    needed the stamp. I don't know whether there is a consular operation now in The
                    Hague so that they don't encounter the same situation as I did.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>The other incident also concerned an administrative problem. We had a hard time
                    getting a cafeteria into the new Chancery building. We couldn't find a
                    concessionaire nor were we at all sure that we could afford one. The Department
                    does not support activities of that kind. So we tried to find someone who would
                    take on the task for whatever revenues there might be. In the old building, the
                    Dutch employees all “brown-bagged” their lunches. The Dutch are pretty shrewd
                    businessmen. One guy looked at the situation and decided that there wouldn't be
                    enough revenues to make it a paying proposition; the Dutch employees were likely
                    to continue to “brown bag” their lunches. We searched and searched and finally
                    managed to convince Heineken Breweries to undertake the job. They found a
                    caterer and they I am sure subsidized the operation. Our only requirement was to
                    stock Heineken beer; in Holland, of course, beer is like Coca-Cola anywhere
                    else; everybody drank it. It never occurred to me that beer might not be
                    eligible for consumption on government property. The brewery did a fine job; the
                    cafeteria ran well. The Dutch employees continued to “brown bag” their lunches,
                    but at least now they had an alternative and the Americans had a convenient
                    eating place. There was one further problem: in the rented quarters, a milkman
                    used to come around to deposit bottles of milk on the desk of the Dutch
                    employees. This was not uncommon in office buildings; the Dutch also drank milk
                    as we drink Coca Cola. Of course, Heineken promoted its beer and people would go
                    down to the cafeteria and bring it back to the office or drink there whenever
                    they felt thirsty. One day, a visiting American came to one of our offices and
                    found one of the local employees with a bottle of beer on his desk. That got
                    back to the Department in a hurry; I think the visitor must have written saying
                    that people in the American Embassy in The Hague sat around their desks drinking
                    beer all day. Needless to say, I heard from the Department in no uncertain terms
                    and that brought an end to the beer drinking on government property. It also
                    brought an end to the cafeteria because Heineken was not going to subsidize the
                    operation if their product could not be made available to the clientele. We did
                    manage to keep a snack bar going, although I am not sure of the final outcome
                    because all this happened as I was about to leave The Hague. I wished them luck.
                    This story was just an illustration of how difficult it was to get the Dutch to
                    change their habits.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Embassy well integrated, with all these various
                        U.S. government agencies being represented?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SKOUFIS: Yes. The Ambassador worked hard on this problem as Dick Service. We used
                    have meetings with all agencies being represented. The programs were pretty well
                    coordinated.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>We had a major ceremony when the new Chancery was opened. A lot of VIPs showed
                    up. We also used to have an annual Fourth of July party in Rotterdam, with
                    fireworks and other extravagances. ESSO and other American firms used to pay for
                    this; the Embassy organized the activities. For example, we would get an Army
                    band from Germany. The whole American community would work together on such
                    activities and it worked quite well. One year, we also had the Brussels' World
                    Fair. We gave our Embassy there as much support as we could helping them procure
                    in Holland items they could not find in Belgium.</p>
                <p>On the whole, The Hague was a very interesting assignment. The new building
                    worked out well. We had some problems which was the result of poor planning. I
                    have never throughout my career been completely satisfied with the FBO
                    operation. I don't remember who was in charge at the time. The new building was
                    developed by a well known architect, Marsall Breuer. He was a well known German
                    architect—he belonged to the Bauhaus school, like Gropius and others. He had
                    designed the IBM building and others in Holland. He had won the contract through
                    competition from FBO. I thought that there were a couple of glaring errors. For
                    example, in Holland, it rains at least 350 days out of the 365 in a year. If you
                    came to the Embassy, you had to get out of a car and walk up six or seven steps
                    in the rain to the entrance level. So everyone who came to the Embassy got wet.
                    When they left, they waited inside the building until a car came and then they
                    had to rush down the wet steps; some slipped on the slick marble.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>That was one of the design problems. The other was that there was no freight
                    elevator because the original design assumed that the mail and code rooms would
                    be on the ground floor, along with the administrative offices. The security
                    people became concerned about this configuration; they weren't happy about
                    sensitive operations like the code and mailrooms being on the ground floor. As
                    the Chancery was being built, there was an incident somewhere in which one of
                    our code rooms was sacked and burned. So after construction had started, the
                    security people demanded that the mail and code rooms be on the top floors. Of
                    course, it was too late to install a freight elevator. So the Dutch postman
                    would just deposit the sacks of mail in the lobby—we wouldn't let him go above
                    the ground floor for security reasons and I doubt whether he would have in any
                    case—, requiring our people to come down from the top floor and drag them
                    upstairs. It was these small annoyances that were a problem; we had to a lot of
                    rebuilding even after we moved in to put in secure areas and separate such
                    things as the classified mailroom from the unclassified mailroom. I remember
                    these incidents very vividly because the Canadians were building their Chancery
                    at the same time. They were more intelligent than our FBO operation; they called
                    our security office in for expert advice and used it to design their building.
                    So here we had two buildings going up practically side by side; the Canadian
                    one, using our security expertise had minimal problems. We, not using the same
                    expertise during the design period, had a lot of scrambling to do after the
                    building was completed. Actually, our security people only got involved late in
                    the game when the regional security officer from Bonn dropped in one day and
                    told us that some of our plans just wouldn't be approved. He was instrumental in
                    persuading the Department to move the code and mailrooms upstairs. I supported
                    him; I just wish the security concerns had been taken into account before the
                    final design had been approved. The Canadians did it the right way; I used to
                    walk through their building while it was under construction. Of course, after it
                    was finished I couldn't go into their secure areas. I had good relationships
                    with my Canadian counterpart.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After The Hague, you went to the Inspection Corps. How did
                        that happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SKOUFIS: When I left The Hague, Ambassador Rice was in charge. I had a good
                    relationship with him. One day, I got a call from Washington telling me that the
                    Inspection Corps wanted me. It came out of the clear blue sky. I had no
                    indication that this would be my fate. During my tenure in The Hague, I must
                    have been inspected a couple of times; I also received a promotion to FSO-3. I
                    said OK to the Inspection Corps having learned a lot about it from the teams
                    that had been in The Hague. During one of these visits, I may well have been
                    asked whether I would be interested and I may have indicated that I would be. I
                    was an ideal candidate; we had no children and therefore we were not tied to any
                    school schedule. I could take my wife with me on the inspection trips. It was
                    cheaper to have her with you than having to pay for housing in Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>I was supposed to report to the Inspection Corps at the beginning of a calendar
                    year, after having been assigned in September, 1961. I was to be part of a new
                    group that started in 1962. But before leaving The Hague, I got a call from the
                    Inspection Corps telling me that one of their inspectors—Ed Wilson—had been
                    taken ill. He was scheduled to go to the Far East with Bill Flake—the same man
                    who had been my boss in South Africa. I was instructed to go to Paris and join
                    the Inspection team there. I was to work one month with that team and then go
                    directly to Vietnam —via Washington—to join Flake in the inspection of our
                    Embassy in Saigon. The stop-over in Washington gave me a chance to buy two
                    summer suites at Schwartz Brothers in Baltimore. I was given the Foreign Service
                    Inspector's manual to read on the plane to Saigon. Of course, in those days, it
                    took a long time to reach Vietnam. The people in Washington wished me “Good
                    luck!”. And that was my baptism into the Inspection Corps. I left Helen in Paris
                    with our car; I told her to catch up with me somewhere along the line, which she
                    eventually did. She brought the car and our other worldly goods home; she got
                    them stored; she got the car garaged and then eventually we were reunited in
                    Vietnam. We inspected our posts there and then went to Cambodia and after that,
                    to Korea. We did these three countries from the end of October until around
                    Christmas time when we finally came home. It was a very interesting experience.
                    Vietnam was not quite yet at the height of hostilities, although we already had
                    a large military advisory group there. Our Ambassador was Fritz Nolting and
                    Francis Cunningham was the DCM. We just felt that there would be more activity
                    in Vietnam; the U.S. build up was evident.</p>
                <p>Our Ambassador in Cambodia was Bill Trimble. Our Ambassador in Korea was Sam
                    Berger with Marshall Green being his deputy. Seoul was an interesting post with
                    the country trying to recover from a devastating war. It was the first time I
                    had been back in the Far East since having served there in World War II. I was
                    the Administrative Inspector. I don't think the inspections were particularly
                    profound. The administrative operations in Vietnam were very well supported by
                    the military who had already sent their logistic people. As I said, the military
                    was expanding; they were renting or buying housing for their own people. The
                    Embassy was just trying to hang on to whatever they could. Henry Sabatini was
                    the Administrative Counselor. He had a large team, particularly in the General
                    Services' area, but he was overwhelmed by the military presence. They were very
                    useful to the Embassy since they had already set up such operations as car
                    repairs shops. If anything was lacking, the military could procure them; they
                    had daily resupply flights. Of course, the U.S. military presence in 1961 was
                    only a fraction of its later operations, but it was already substantial.</p>
                <p>Cambodia was a much smaller post, which had no special problems. The Embassy's
                    relationship with the government was not very close.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us a little about your views of the Inspection Corps
                        as a management tool.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>SKOUFIS: I was in the Inspection Corps for three years. In the second year, I
                    went to India, Ceylon, Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq. In the third year, I went to
                    Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia and northern Italy. In retrospect, I
                    don't believe that the Inspection Corps was not a very effective tool; it was
                    good as the “eyes and ears” of the Department since we could report back on the
                    sensitivities and feelings and relationships that we encountered in the field.
                    Probably our most contribution came from dealing with any special problems to
                    which we were alerted or which we encountered. The Department would brief us
                    before departure on these special problems and would also alert us during the
                    inspections through a special communications channel that we had. These problems
                    might involve a break down in substantive reporting or some personnel problems
                    or the lack of administrative services to other agencies. It seemed to me that
                    we were able to make a contribution to these special issues simply by
                    highlighting them in our inspection reports. we had of course no assurance that
                    by including these problems in our reports, any effective actions would be taken
                    subsequently either by the post or the Department. The follow-up system during
                    this period was practically non-existent. The post was required to report back
                    in a period of time what it had done about the Inspectors' recommendations. But
                    there was no rigorous follow up; there was no central authority to police
                    actions taken. The breakdown occurred in part because we were not sure for whom
                    we were working. Were we working for the Inspector General? Or the regional
                    assistant secretary? Or the Secretary? or the Deputy Under Secretary for
                    Administration? We were not sure who the end users of the reports really were.
                    That fundamental issue had not been sufficiently developed. Later, greater
                    efforts were made to coordinate the implementation of the inspectors' reports.
                    But in 1961-64, there wasn't much follow-up; only the special situations were
                    handled.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>We did in those days write up efficiency ratings on every American at a post
                    which ended up in their personnel files. I thought that this was a vicious
                    system. It was very hard to write a balanced efficiency rating. I would go into
                    a code room. In India, there may have been as many as thirty employees working
                    on shifts. I did not feel that I was at all remotely qualified to attest to the
                    efficiency of any of these code room clerks. I spoke with each of them; they all
                    had an opportunity to tell me any problems that they might have or about their
                    hopes for future assignments. I would take notes so that I could incorporate
                    their views in my personnel or efficiency reports that I would make. That was
                    easy enough. But to comment on the employee's effectiveness I had to rely on the
                    supervisor which would just be a repetition of what the supervisor had or would
                    be including in the employee's annual efficiency rating. We didn't have access
                    to any reports that might have been filed in the Department, so that we were
                    essentially starting with no background on the individual. To write a balanced
                    efficiency rating under these circumstances was very difficult. It was easier to
                    reach a judgement on the role that the Administrative Counselor played or on the
                    effectiveness of the administrative section as a whole based on comments of
                    other members of the Embassy. You could also judge the Administrative officer
                    from the amount of information he or she had about the administrative
                    operations. That was easier to do, but to pass judgment on an individual
                    employee of a section, that was very hard. The communications sections gave me
                    particular difficulties. Korea had a big communications section. I could observe
                    the supervisor relatively well; you could get a feel for his effectiveness from
                    talking to members of the staff and therefore my conclusions had some support.
                    But for the staff members themselves, I had to write some very wishy-washy
                    reports that couldn't help the employee; I just hoped it didn't do him or her
                    any harm. I really didn't feel that I contributed anything with the individual
                    staff efficiency reports. This whole issue became the subject of discussion
                    among the inspectors. We got the system changed the following year. We were told
                    not to write anything that wasn't needed; if we had read any recent reports and
                    could confirm that the reports was generally accurate, then nothing further
                    needed to be said. We were just requested to confirm what had been previously
                    written. Of course, that wasn't much help either. So I was very frustrated by
                    this aspect of the inspection work. The process may not have been as fatal in
                    the administrative side as it was on the substantive side because the
                    competition among the substantive officers was a little keener than it was among
                    the administrative types—I may be wrong on that, but that was my feeling.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>I also handled consular operations on a couple of the inspections. In the first
                    year, I went with Bill Flake, as I mentioned. Then I inspected the consular
                    operations because he had his hands full with political, economic and
                    politico-military issues and personnel. The consular operations in Vietnam,
                    Cambodia and Korea were relatively easy because there wasn't any massive
                    workloads. Most of the work concerned “war babies” and American services; much
                    of the work was done by the private social services agencies. But when we got to
                    India, Sam Boykin, the senior inspector, reviewed the consular operations
                    because he had at one time been the consular affairs office in the Department.
                    So he knew a lot about the work and the people and said he would like to do that
                    inspection. Sam didn't have as much background in political and economic work
                    and therefore spent most of his inspection time on consular operations. In any
                    case, in India, I had my hands full with a sizeable administrative section (Joe
                    Donelan was the Counselor for Administration); same in Iran and Afghanistan. In
                    many of the other inspections, I did the consular operations for which I had
                    some background in light of my work in SCA. I did not think we did a very
                    thorough job on consular operations, but the potential for an inspector doing
                    damage was far greater than for doing any good. I was always aware of that
                    pitfall and tried to be very careful. As a consequence, I may not have been as
                    effective as inspector as I might have been. I did not see my role as that of a
                    gumshoe. I did the best I could within limits.</p>
                <p>What I did find out about the system was that in terms of identifying quality
                    staff in the Foreign Service, one could walk into an Embassy and in a very short
                    time know who were “the boys in the white hats”. These were people who would
                    rise in the ranks—officers and staff employees who were “comers”. You knew that
                    these people would move up in their Service; you could spot the potential
                    Ambassadors in very short order. You could spot an employee in General Services
                    and know that he or she would be an Administrative Counselor one day. You were
                    seldom wrong. I was on a team that went to Yugoslavia, were Bob Cleveland was
                    the Economic Minister and were Larry Eagleburger and Jim Lowenstein were FSO-4s.
                    You felt that they would rise in the ranks; they were moving fast. They were
                    guys in “the white hats”.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>Then you could identify the people who were going nowhere—”the black hats”. They
                    were five-eight percent of the staff. The group in the middle were “the gray
                    hats”. There were a lot of them. There ten percent “white hats”, eight percent
                    “black hats”; the rest were all “gray hats”. That was a pretty good evaluation
                    of the Foreign Service. I found that picture to be true even after I left the
                    Inspection Corps and went on to other jobs. I had experiences as administrative
                    officer with a couple of hotshots who worked for me, a few who weren't going
                    anywhere and the majority in the middle. That carried over to the kind of
                    backstopping we, the administrative officers at an Embassy, would get from
                    Washington. In some instances, the support was excellent; in some instances, not
                    so good. That was my experience at least. For example, when I inspected some of
                    the Iron Curtain countries, I had the impression that a disproportionate amount
                    of the European Affairs Bureau resources went to Paris, London and Rome and less
                    to Warsaw, Poznan, Belgrade, etc. It is true that this was marginal, but you
                    could detect it. It took longer for people to get things done behind the Iron
                    Curtain. Some was due to the Washington inertia, but probably much was due to
                    the local situation, which did not attract the same kind of caliber American
                    personnel as the big Western European capitals. The reasons are easily
                    understandable. Except for the language officers, most people preferred Western
                    Europe. The general proposition was also true for other geographical areas. New
                    Delhi attracted a higher quality personnel than Kabul did. The same with Iran.
                    Iraq was a holding operation; the caliber was not great.</p>
                <p>The large number of employees in the middle category were quite acceptable. They
                    put in a good day's work every day, but they would never shine. They were
                    adequate at “holding the fort”. But it was clear that they would not rise in the
                    ranks very far. They were obviously not “comers”. You learned a few techniques
                    in the Inspection Corps. One was to keep a pad with you as you went about your
                    work. At the end of the day, you would note the names of those you met whom you
                    thought were pretty good, why you thought they were good. You did the same for
                    the bad employees. You kept these notes as a reference point. I was told by a
                    couple of the experienced inspectors that these notes would prove very useful
                    once you left the Inspection Corps because although you might tend to forget the
                    names of the people you met, they would tend to remember you because you were
                    probably the only inspector they met in a particular post. In later assignments,
                    a certain individual may be nominated for your section and you could always
                    refer back to your inspection notes to get a feel for who he or she was. If the
                    notes were too negative, you could always try to get the assignment changed and
                    have another individual assigned to your section. That was one of reasons I
                    described the system as vicious, but that is what inspectors did do at the time.
                    I don't think that is true anymore, but it was a common practice certainly in
                    the early 60s.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>You have to remember that this was a period when administration in the Department
                    was going through a new phase. Crockett was first the Assistant Secretary for
                    Administration and then the Deputy Under Secretary for Administration. There was
                    a new emphasis on administration in the Department and it was improving
                    tremendously. There was more feedback; there was a more positive attitude to
                    solving some of the administrative problems we were facing. The resources may
                    even have been increased. I had the impression that most posts were getting what
                    they wanted in terms of financial resources from the Bureaus. We did face the
                    usual problems of travel freezes—the kind of actions that had a real impact on
                    the Service and particularly people at hardship posts, like the Eastern European
                    posts. There an officer would get his orders one day and be gone the next. Then
                    the post would wait for the replacement, which could take four to six weeks
                    because the replacement was not in any hurry, unless he or she was a Eastern
                    European specialist, or the family had to wait for the kids to get out of
                    school. The officer in Poznan or anywhere else in Eastern Europe didn't care
                    what time of year it was; he would get his kids out of school and be gone home.
                    We saw that frequently as we inspected these Eastern European posts.</p>
                <p>The Department's briefings for the inspectors were excellent. Each time before we
                    left we were briefed and then we had another discussion with the bureau when we
                    returned. As I said, bureaus became much more responsive to the field's needs in
                    the early 60s than they had been previously. I think that was the result of the
                    new vitality that was being built into the administrative program. The
                    Washington offices seemed to me to become more responsive. There were problems
                    such as travel freeze which I described earlier. But there was an effort made to
                    become more understanding of the problems of the field. The Wriston program had
                    worked well in that respect. The employee in the Department who back-stopped a
                    field post had been there; he or she understood the problems better, greatly
                    improving the quality of the administrative support the field received from
                    Washington. Rotation between the field and Washington was beginning to show some
                    pay-offs in the early 60s.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>I was somewhat concerned by the establishment of regional offices. I considered
                    that in many cases this was layering. I never fully agreed with the need, for
                    example, to have a regional communications officer or a regional security
                    officer in Beirut who would travel through their region periodically to observe
                    operations at various posts. Maybe it was important for the regional bureau
                    because they could put an experienced officer in one of the regional positions.
                    He would be available to help the less experienced officer at a post. That may
                    have helped. Nevertheless, I thought the concept was essentially layering—more
                    bureaucracy, making the work at a post a little more difficult because there was
                    always a watch dog coming to look at operations. Every regional officer I knew
                    always made sure to get to a post just before the inspectors did. So when you
                    would ask someone why he or she was doing things a certain way, the answer would
                    invariably: “Well, the regional officer was here two weeks ago and that is what
                    he suggested”. We ran into that frequently. Then you would have to wonder why
                    you had inspectors. Then if you went to Beirut, for example, you would have to
                    inspect the regional operation. You couldn't really evaluate the officer because
                    all he did was to travel around his region. How could you write a report on that
                    operation?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned earlier the improving quality of the support
                        that the administrative people in the field were receiving. Did the good
                        administrative people really care about Washington's support?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SKOUFIS: It was important for field personnel to keep good relationships with
                    their Washington counterparts. At least, that was my philosophy. I found it
                    useful to have a good relationship. That is not an answer to your question. I
                    think you were asking whether there were not some administrative officers who
                    wouldn't make a move without Washington's blessing whereas others moved out and
                    would accept the consequences of their actions. I found a number in each
                    category. The ones that took action as they deemed appropriate were on the whole
                    the more successful types. For example, Joe Donelan was one of that group. He
                    was the administrative counselor in New Delhi when I inspected that post. He
                    really got things done in that Embassy under very difficult circumstances. He
                    had a very difficult relationship with the DCM; it was not Joe's fault as we
                    tried to document. I think the new spirit in the early 60s encouraged people to
                    take initiatives; it certainly did not inhibit independent action.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>I did however note the lack of Washington concern for the living conditions at
                    some of the posts which I inspected. In New Delhi, the assistance program had
                    helped to develop an air conditioning industry—it may have been Carrier or some
                    other major manufacturer. The AID warehouse was full of these Indian produced
                    air conditioners and they were giving them to their own employees as well as
                    schools and other Indian facilities. Therefore, when you went to an AID
                    employee's house, you would find an air conditioner in the living room, the
                    bedroom, etc. A State employee's house, particularly in the constituent posts,
                    would have only one air conditioner per occupied bedroom. That was the State
                    rule imposed by Washington (FBO, I guess). The rule was probably alright if it
                    been applied to all American employees in India. AID was practically giving them
                    away, but the Embassy could not cut through the Department's red tape. Joe was
                    very active in trying to get the Department to change its rules. He had good
                    relationships with the AID staff and therefore acquired the extra air
                    conditioners for the State people. It took a lot of work on his part to get that
                    accomplished. The Department resisted for a long time because it was wedded to
                    its worldwide standards. It wouldn't make an exception for a unique situation in
                    which air conditioners were plentiful and probably free, or at least very cheap.
                    It was not like Thailand or Vietnam. I remember very clearly getting a message
                    from the Department telling me that State had a worldwide rule which it was not
                    willing to break under any circumstances; that policy called for air
                    conditioners to be available only in bedrooms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was New Delhi unique? Was that the only post you found at
                        which people from different agencies were being treated differently?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SKOUFIS: We did find that situation in other posts as well. AID and USIA both had
                    better housing facilities in some places. I have often thought that the U.S.
                    government would be better served if all civilian Americans serving overseas
                    were under a single personnel system. We were too fragmented. The concept that
                    the State contingent was the first among equals was not accepted overseas, both
                    on the substantive side and the administrative side. The clever administrative
                    officer was noted by the extent to which he was able to obtain goods and
                    services from other agencies for the State employees. The less skillful went by
                    the book. Marshall Jones was the Administrative Counselor in Korea; he could get
                    anything he wanted from the military. If the Ambassador's lawn needed to be cut,
                    he could get the Army to do that. For the Fourth of July parties, they would set
                    up the tents on the Ambassador's lawn. Jones had no problems at all which was a
                    tribute to the skills he had in using the resources of other agencies to support
                    the State Department programs. Joe Donelan in India, as I said, had similar
                    skills. It is true of course that the administrative counselor could and did use
                    his office to support other agencies, but the effective ones made sure that the
                    support went both ways. The other agencies in general had more resources than
                    State.</p>
                <p>On the personnel side, it would not be accurate to generalize on the level of
                    competence of each agency. There were good people in the staff of all agencies;
                    there were bad people in the staff of all agencies. It varied from post to
                    post.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>One thing that I learned from my tour in the Inspection Corps was that the U.S.
                    government's interest was best served when all of its overseas representation
                    was served by one joint administrative operation and that was particularly true
                    if that operation was a good one. We inspected a number of posts where there
                    wasn't any joint administrative effort. I always thought that this was a waste
                    of resources. There was a lot of duplication at such posts. All agencies had
                    administrative staffs, primarily to worry about their program funds. They had to
                    budget for those funds and account for them. That was alright; that was a
                    distinct and separate function which was best handled by each agency. But for
                    the services that were required by all agencies, I fully support the concept of
                    a single joint administrative operation. I think it works. The difficulty was
                    primarily in convincing the active heads of other agencies to accept the
                    concept. I say “active” because although a lot of those people gave lip service
                    to the country team concept, many ran their own operations without coordination
                    with the Embassy, in any way they wanted. Their actions may or may not have
                    conformed with Embassy views and policies, but that is the way they felt that
                    their Washington headquarters wanted them to operate. The inspectors would
                    report on situations of this kind. Some ambassadors and DCMs would raise the
                    issue with the inspectors.</p>
                <p>Sam Berger, our Ambassador in Korea, used to hold country team meetings. The U.S.
                    military would be represented by a number of generals. When he walked into that
                    meeting, everybody stood up. That was impressive; you obviously felt that he had
                    made an impression and that there was no question about who represented the U.
                    S. government in Korea. It was Sam Berger, not a general; he was the President's
                    representative. He did primarily through the force of his personality and the
                    way he ran his mission. On the other hand, our Ambassador in Vietnam, Fritz
                    Nolting, somehow didn't have the same capability. You had a feeling that the
                    Army was running away with the situation in Vietnam. They probably were! The
                    Embassy was quite sensitive to the problems of dealing with the government of
                    Vietnam, but you had the feelings that that government was going off on its own
                    and that only our military could rein it in. It scared the hell out of me when I
                    was there. Berger went to Vietnam later as a super-DCM to see whether he could
                    get the situation under some control; I don't know how he did, but it was clear
                    to me when I was in Saigon that the Embassy needed someone like Berger who could
                    restrain both the Vietnamese government and our own military.</p>
                <p>There is no doubt in my mind that the American ambassador is the senior U.S.
                    representative in a foreign country, even if there was a large presence of U.S.
                    military. That is basic to our concept of government—civilian control of
                    military.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1963, you finished your assignment to the Inspection

                <p>SKOUFIS: While we were inspecting the posts in Northern Italy, I got a phone call
                    and a cable from the Department informing me that the Office of Personnel was
                    being reorganized and expanded. A new Director had been appointed—Bernie
                    Rosen—who had come to the Department from the Civil Service Commission. Among
                    the new innovations, was the establishment of a career management concept. The
                    idea was to have experts in the various Foreign Service specialties to assist in
                    the assignment process so that career patterns could be developed for each
                    employee. I was asked to take the job as career management officer for the
                    administrative “cone”. Those were the days when we became very “cone” conscious.
                    My immediate supervisor as Earl Sohm.</p>
                <p>I didn't finish the northern Italy inspection. I was instructed to report to the
                    Department immediately. Joe Eggert had been in the position and he was being
                    assigned to an overseas position. I worked as a career management officer for a
                    little more than a year. I found it interesting, but very frustrating. The
                    Office of Personnel was not in Main State, but a block away in the Civil Service
                    Commission building. It was very difficult to get this concept of career
                    management off the ground; career management officers were primarily used to
                    index the skills of the Foreign Service. That is what I basically did for my
                    year. I did have an opportunity to talk to all the administrative people when
                    they returned from their overseas assignments. That helped me to develop a
                    profile on each—where they had been and where they wanted to go. I tried to make
                    an assessment of their potential for rising in the Service. I had a large
                    clientele—general services officers, personnel officers, communicators, etc. It
                    gave a further insight into the Foreign Service, but I am not sure that the
                    career management concept was viable in terms of improving the careers of the
                    Foreign Service people. It was a good experiment since it permitted us to get a
                    good inventory of the skills available to us.</p>
                <p>In 1963, the deputy Under Secretary for Administration was Bill Crockett. The
                    Director General in 1963 was Tyler Thompson; a few months later Joe Palmer was
                    appointed to that position followed by John Steeves. The Director of Personnel
                    was Bernie Rosen. He had some good thoughts; he was a professional personnel
                    officer. he brought a fellow by the name of Walt Jacobson with him. Their
                    assignment was to install a personnel system in the State Department which would
                    be able to deal with the uniqueness of the Foreign Service. They tried hard to
                    put the personnel operations on a sounder basis, but I am not sure that they
                    were very successful.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you mentioned, the early 60s saw an emphasis on the
                        “cone” system which stressed the objective of managing the Foreign Service
                        by specialties. This is a concept that has been debated vigorously in the
                        Department for many years. Do you have any views about this issue—the
                        “generalist” vs. the “specialist”?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>SKOUFIS: First of all, let me say that the pendulum in the State Department
                    swings widely from time to time. When a new idea takes hold, it is pushed to
                    extremes; then over a period of time, it returns to the center when it becomes
                    effective. In the matter that you have raised, I think there has been an
                    over-emphasis on “specialization”. I didn't feel that the system needed to be as
                    rigid as it was being developed in 1963. It seemed to me that artificial
                    corridors were being built and people were being forced to walk in those
                    corridors even as they progressed in the Foreign Service and expanded their
                    experiences. My conclusion was that a good “generalist” could manage almost all
                    the jobs in the Foreign Service. I might have made an exception for economists
                    because that required some depth of expertise, although I also felt that
                    sometimes that was overemphasized. But over-all, I felt that good “generalists”
                    should be the back-bone of the Foreign Service. Their availability was the most
                    effective of managing a post and handling our foreign relations. My view is
                    supported by the view that our system provides for non-career ambassadors; some
                    of them have had little applicable foreign relation experiences, but in general
                    the majority of the political appointments have worked out just fine.There is a
                    role for certain special skills in the Department and the Foreign Service. But
                    those, if they can't be provided from within the Service, can be hired from
                    other agencies; that has been done on a number of occasions—the commercial
                    officers who came from the Department of Commerce, the financial attach�s from
                    the Department of the Treasury. But on balance, I conclude that the
                    over-emphasis on “specialists” has not been to the advantage of the Foreign
                    Service. I would prefer a Foreign Service of “generalists” with some
                    geographical area experience as contracted to a rigid system of
                    “specialists”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You referred earlier to the “pendulum swings” in the
                        Department's management. Tell us more about your views of the consequences
                        of this style of management?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SKOUFIS: It can be demoralizing in many ways. Some people gained from this
                    situation; others lost. The people that lost were more numerous than those that
                    gained in terms, for example, of assignments. The periodic shift from one
                    extreme to the other demoralized people; after a while, they didn't believe that
                    the system would work to their benefit. It isn't of course necessary that
                    systems work to the benefit of employees, but they must have some trust in it.
                    In the case of State, the system didn't even work for the benefit of the
                    organization. As a result, you ended up with chaos; there were vacuums created
                    when the pendulum swung. Other people moved into the vacuums, despite a
                    theoretical centralized personnel system. The continual vacillation between
                    centralization and decentralization of personnel responsibilities created an
                    opportunity for the regional bureaus to take control and therefore in the final
                    analysis, an officer's assignment pretty much dictated and controlled by the
                    regional bureau. It was those bureaus that were interested in a particular
                    employee and provided him or her with a job. The bureaus held the upper hand
                    over the central personnel office. Often these bureaus had strong executive
                    directors and it seemed to me that they took advantage of the inability of the
                    system to maintain a steady course and to develop.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>When I was in Personnel, assignments were made by boards. The Career Development
                    Office was one of three or four offices that were represented on the board.
                    There were representatives from the Personnel Office's geographic divisions,
                    from the regional bureaus and probably some others. We tried to accommodate the
                    needs of the Department with the wishes of the employee. The Career Management
                    process raised false expectations. A Foreign Service officer would come in to
                    talk to one of the career counselors and usually had expectations far beyond his
                    or her capabilities. But once those expectations were put on record with a
                    career counselor, the officer undoubtedly felt that his or her wishes would be
                    met. Of course, in many cases, the assignments that the officer had anticipated
                    never materialized because there were better qualified candidates. It was not up
                    to us to evaluate his or her performance; we of course had access to the
                    evaluation files, but we never put anything in those files that might come to
                    the attention of the selection boards. So it seemed to me that the career
                    management process raised false expectations. That created problems both for the
                    central Personnel Office and the regional bureaus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the mid-60s, you had experience in both a bureau in the
                        Department and in the central Personnel Office. Did you develop any views
                        about a central assignment process in contrast to one managed by the various
                        operating bureaus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SKOUFIS: I did give that question considerable thought. I concluded that the
                    operating bureaus should have the assignment responsibility. In the first place,
                    the bureaus had the responsibility for the management of their overseas posts.
                    For example, if a bureau was assigned an officer that it didn't want, it could
                    hold up the whole process by just saying that no further assignments could be
                    made to a particular post because the bureau was running short of financial
                    resources. Or it would say that it already had too many people. There were all
                    sorts of games that the bureaus, which controlled the financial resources, could
                    play. They were in the driver's seat when it came to personnel assignments. So
                    it seemed to me that the bureaus should also be responsible for assignments as
                    contrasted to a highly centralized assignment process. I didn't believe that a
                    centralized system would have sufficient wisdom. I know that my view creates
                    problems because that means that there will always be people who are
                    unassignable because of their reputations. That is a major problem. A
                    centralized system could force bureaus to take these people, despite the
                    bureaus' efforts to the contrary. But I don't think that outweighs the
                    advantages of a decentralized assignment operation.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>The functional bureaus had a serious problem being assigned officers whom they
                    wished to have. We had to work very hard to provide manpower to those bureaus.
                    Fortunately, the regional bureaus were limited in the number of positions they
                    could have so that they couldn't have all of the people they wanted. I ran into
                    that problem later when I worked in the Secretary's office. The functional
                    bureaus had a problem, but I did not think it was insurmountable. There were
                    enough people in the system to provide everyone's quantitative needs, at least.
                    We had no problem in SCA because we could draw from the pool of consular
                    officers. The major problems were CU (Cultural Affairs) and INR (Intelligence
                    and Research). In the final analysis, they got staffed, although sometimes to
                    the unhappiness of the officer concerned who had different expectations. Neither
                    bureaus were considered a “plum” unless you were an area specialist and could
                    pursue your interests in INR.There was a lot of bargaining over assignments when
                    I worked in Personnel. That was part of our tasks—to work out these assignments
                    with the regional bureaus before the decisions were to be made by the Assignment
                    Panels. Almost all the time, the regional bureaus got their wishes in terms of
                    specific individuals. We had to be careful of “cronyism” which is a real bugaboo
                    in the Foreign Service. Certain bureaus had their favorite candidates—people who
                    had worked in those bureaus for many years and had become members of their
                    “regional clubs”. New officers had a hard time breaking into these “clubs”.
                    Sometime you had to fight the whole system in order to get an officer to a
                    particular position, if he or she were not identified with the controlling
                    “club”. There were a lot of “clubs”. The other side of that coin is of course
                    that the “club' members became real experts in a particular region or function
                    which was considered by some as the real strength of the Foreign Service. So
                    from the point of view of the Service, the continued assignment of the same
                    officers to the same area was a plus because they developed real
                    expertise—language, culture, etc. Those officers served us well, especially in
                    such places as the Iron Curtain countries during the Cold War. We were probably
                    well served by these specialists also in the Far East. But during the year I was
                    in Personnel, the Foreign Service did not expand; as a matter of fact, during my
                    thirty years in it, the Foreign Service grew, but it was incremental. When
                    financial resources became scarce, the system tightened up a little, which made
                    it more difficult for an officer to break into a new area or to become an expert
                    in a new function. During my inspection tours, I became acquainted with a number
                    of officers who had spent almost their entire career in Southeast Asia: India,
                    Afghanistan, Ceylon. They were excellent people who later on took on jobs of
                    greater and greater responsibility. From my perspective, I think it is better to
                    have people who have deep knowledge of an area or function rather than having a
                    generalized world-wide knowledge. It served our needs better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the year 1963-64, you had an opportunity to evaluate
                        the administrative talent in the Foreign Service. What were your views on
                        the Department's competence in that area?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>SKOUFIS: I came away from that experience with a feeling that the system was in
                    pretty good hands. On the whole, the administrative types in the Foreign Service
                    were pretty competent. Obviously, there were some better than others, but in
                    general we were well staffed. One reason might have been that we were bringing
                    in some outside talent during this period. We had an active recruitment process
                    for good budget and fiscal officers, for example. We had a steady stream of new
                    administrative people coming into the system; I thought that was a pretty good
                    program. I got some pretty good insights into the available talents by writing
                    the profiles on the people I interviewed. All in all, my year in Personnel was a
                    very useful year. I think I got more out of the system that I gave to it because
                    in part it was a new process that was just getting off the ground; it had a
                    somewhat rocky start, but on the whole, it worked out alright. There was some
                    resistance to the concept of career management by some in the Foreign Service;
                    there were people who felt that they were losing some of their authority; that
                    was particularly true of people in the regional bureaus; they initially resented
                    this new approach. To some extent, their perceptions may have been true, but in
                    the final analysis, it didn't really work out that way. As trust developed among
                    the participants in the assignment process, the system improved. It just took
                    time to develop that trust.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1964, you became the Executive Director of the Office
                        of the Secretary. How did that happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SKOUFIS: One day, my boss, Earl Sohm, called me. He had gotten a call from the
                    Office of the Secretary telling him that the Executive Director, Murray Jackson,
                    was leaving for an overseas assignment. Who ever was involved wanted to know
                    whether I would be interested in being considered for that vacancy. I said:
                    “Sure!”. I had just been recommended by the selection boards for a promotion to
                    FSO-2. I thought it would be a good assignment and more in line with my career
                    interests. The career management position was more of a staff job; I preferred
                    operational responsibilities. It was a perfect assignment and fortunately I was
                    chosen by Ben Reid, who was then the Department's Executive Secretary. As soon
                    as the selection was made, I moved to the new office and went to work.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>The Secretary of State was Dean Rusk; the Under Secretary was George Ball. They
                    had assembled a very good staff to support them. I found it a real privilege to
                    work in that Office. My role primarily was to coordinate the administrative
                    support that the Secretary and the Under Secretary required: personnel, payroll,
                    etc. The largest component of the Secretary's office was the Executive
                    Secretariat—the people who processed the papers going to the Secretary and the
                    Under Secretary, making sure that they had been properly prepared and cleared.
                    The Secretariat also made sure that the decisions reached by the Secretary and
                    Under Secretary were implemented. Beyond the immediate Office of the Secretary
                    and Under Secretary, the Seventh Floor complex included the Policy Planning
                    Staff, the special assistants for different functions (e.g., fisheries, labor),
                    the Counselor, the Assistant Secretary for Congressional Affairs (Doug Macarthur
                    was the incumbent at the time). My role was to coordinate the financial aspects
                    of these operations, preparing the budgets and in general supporting them in any
                    way one could. Soon after I became Executive Director, the U.S. got involved in
                    the Congo crisis and that required an expansion of the Executive Secretariat.
                    This was one of the early attempts to develop an Operations Center which
                    required urgent financial and personnel resources. We operated practically
                    around the clock during this crisis. It was a very modest effort compared to
                    what a permanent Operations Center became later, but this was the beginning of a
                    24 hour watch operations. At the time I am discussing, we were principally
                    interested in keeping our principals informed of events in a critical area of
                    the world. The Congo crisis, as I said, was one of the first to test the
                    concept. That crisis required the Secretary and the Under Secretary to be in
                    their offices for almost 24 hours a day, seven days per week, dealing with the
                    cable traffic coming and going to Congo and other posts on the crisis and to
                    coordinate the efforts of the Department and other government agencies as the
                    crisis unfolded. To assist the Department's principals and to make sure that
                    information, both written and verbal, flowed to the right places, including the
                    White House which was deeply involved in this crisis management, we established
                    a support activity staffed primarily by Foreign Service officers which would be
                    a filter the information traffic from the Department, the filed and other
                    agencies and who make sure that the necessary information got to the right
                    places in a timely fashion. We ran this support operation around the clock. The
                    Secretary would be briefed periodically; when he arrived in the office in the
                    morning, he would be immediately briefed on what had transpired during the
                    night. The Secretariat and the Operations Center were the information traffic
                    controllers who made sure that the Secretary, the Under Secretary and the
                    appropriate bureaus were currently informed.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>When I became the Executive Director, there already was a very small Operations
                    Center working. But we had to expand it to take care of the Congo crisis, which
                    meant moving some people off the Seventh Floor. We wanted to have the Operations
                    Center as close to the Secretary's office as possible. It was a good group of
                    people who staffed the Operations Center. We got more equipment, upgrading our
                    ability to communicate with the White House, for example. The White House had
                    also started developing its own operations center and it became critical that
                    the two centers be able to be in continual and immediate communications. We
                    developed a good communications link. It was one of the first classified
                    communications lines which enabled us to transmitted us to send messages to the
                    White House and back without having to go through a coding-decoding process
                    because the lines were shielded. Before we installed this link, we used to run
                    messages beck and forth in a car. It worked out beautifully.</p>
                <p>The Congo crisis was the beginning. Then Vietnam started to heat up, then we had
                    the Dominican Republic crisis. We had a change in some of the key positions in
                    the Secretary's office. Tom Mann moved up from AA to become Under Secretary for
                    Economic Affairs. Because of his background in Latin American affairs, Mann
                    became on the principals involved in the Dominican Republic crisis. Averell
                    Harriman was also one of the principals and concentrated on Far East issues and
                    especially Vietnam. So while I was in S/S, it was a very active place. All of
                    the those crises as well as many other problems required close liaison with the
                    White House. One day, President Johnson came over to have lunch with the
                    Secretary. He walked through the Operations Center and saw a piece of equipment
                    that was coding some material from some newspapers. He stopped and read the tape
                    and couldn't figure out the sources of the material. When he asked, he was told
                    that this was the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS) material; that
                    was a U.S. government agency that read foreign media material, translated it and
                    distributed it to U.S. government officials. Johnson thought that was
                    fascinating. He immediate ordered that a FBIS machine be put in the President's
                    office. We never considered the information entirely reliable, although it was
                    an additional bit of input. But the President wanted it.</p>
                <p>My office coordinated the catering of this lunch with the President, the
                    Secretary and a few of the Department's senior officers. We brought in a
                    bartender to serve the sherry, which was the custom before the meal was served.
                    But President fooled us all and asked for a low-cal Root Beer. Everybody broke
                    out in a great flutter and looked high and low. Finally, they found a bottle. It
                    tested our resourcefulness to the full, but that is the sort of thing that an
                    administrative staff had be alert to. On the whole, the Executive Director's job
                    was very interesting because it was a very busy period.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>My office was also responsible for the liaison with the White House on the use of
                    military aircraft so that Secretary could use that mode of transportation when
                    he was going abroad or when he had to fly down to the Johnson Ranch in Texas.
                    The President would periodically call Secretary Rusk down to discuss some
                    problems. The White House controlled these aircraft so that we had to go to the
                    military staff to obtain transportation. They would arrange it and the Secretary
                    would then go to Andrews Air Force base to take off.</p>
                <p>I remember the time when Henry Cabot Lodge had just returned from Vietnam. The
                    President wanted Lodge to go to Europe to explain what our Far East policies
                    were. After the President and Ambassador Lodge had met, I got the word through
                    Ben Reid that Ambassador Lodge was going on a Presidential mission with a small
                    supporting cast. My job was to get an airplane. So I called the White House and
                    was told that no aircraft was available. It was suggested that since there were
                    so few people travelling, the Lodge party should go commercial. That made good
                    sense to me and I didn't foresee any problems; neither did Ben Reid and others.
                    i was to get in touch with Ambassador Lodge in Massachusetts to inform him that
                    we were making reservations and that we would have the tickets very soon. When
                    he heard my message, he very politely informed me that he would not go
                    commercial; he would only fly from Andrews Air Force base. If there were no
                    military aircraft available, then he just wouldn't go at all. I had to go back
                    to Ben and convey the message; he asked me to call the White House again to see
                    whether there had been any commitments had been made on aircraft during the
                    conversations that the President and the Ambassador had had. Finally, after
                    getting no response from the colonels, I called Jack Valenti and I asked him the
                    question. I told him what I had heard from Ambassador Lodge. Valenti told me
                    that he would give me an answer that afternoon. Sure enough, that afternoon I
                    got a call from Andrews telling me that they had an airplane ready to take
                    Ambassador Lodge. I then called Valenti to thank him for his efforts. Those were
                    the episodes that made the job interesting. Of course, the word immediately got
                    around the Department that a plane was going to Europe. All the strap hangers
                    would call or come to see me to see whether they could hop aboard. By the time
                    we were finished, the Lodge party had tripled. Everybody seemed to have a reason
                    all of a sudden to go to Europe. Of course, it did save the government some
                    money.</p>
                <p>Some later, we got a bill from the Air Force for all these trips. I must have
                    left the Executive Director's job before that issue was ever resolved. The
                    amount must have been astronomical. I think we settled the issue somehow, but I
                    am not sure that we ever paid.. Our travel was not a “freebie” as far as the Air
                    Force was concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your vantage point at the pinnacle of the Department,
                        did you get any feel for how effective the Department was?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>SKOUFIS: It was interesting to see the Department from that point of view. It was
                    responsive to us and very effective. In the first place, when the crises broke
                    out, the State Department professionals really reacted quickly and effectively.
                    I was surprised by the attention that the top-level people in the Department
                    paid to the details. They had to call people and be briefed on all the details
                    of an event. That stemmed, as I learned later, by their concern for being
                    queried by the White House on details. There was a pension for details in the
                    White House that forced the senior officers in the Department to be read to
                    answer questions on the even the most minute and perhaps insignificant point.
                    All the special assistants on the Seventh Floor, all of whom were career
                    personnel, either Foreign or Civil Service—like George Springsteen or Jeff
                    Kitchen in Politico-Military—had all the facts at their finger tips. Moreover,
                    S/S had first call on the best talent in the Foreign Service and the Department.
                    When we had a vacancy in the Secretariat, which was generally staffed by
                    officers at the FSO-4 level, we were given names of the best candidates that the
                    system could find—people like Larry Eagleburger (whose name was on one list that
                    was sent to me; I grabbed him immediately because I knew he was a sharp young
                    man), Jim Lowenstein (he wanted a job in S/S. I told him he had one, but after
                    he returned from home leave, that job had been filled by someone else because
                    Personnel said that we were getting too many of the cream of the crop. I had to
                    give Jim up to another bureau, which also wanted him; I kept arguing and I think
                    the decision was finally made by the Director General; it went against us
                    because we were draining off all the talent), Dick Moose, Bob Gray. There were a
                    lot of talent officers in S/S/.</p>
                <p>Ed Little was one of the special assistants to the Secretary. Ed was leaving for
                    an overseas assignment and we had to replace him. The other special assistant
                    was Ed Streator, but he was too junior to move up to the senior spot. I called
                    Personnel and I asked for the files of the five best FSO-3 officers in the
                    Service. One of them was Tom Pickering; another was Charlie Bray. Tom became our
                    first choice. I based my judgement just on the file. I thought I had him, but
                    then I was called by the Director General saying that Tom was slated to become a
                    DCM, although he also agreed that Tom was the best candidate of those they had
                    sent to me. But Personnel felt that he was needed at some critical post in
                    Africa; so e lost him. But we got Art “Buck” Borg, who was my second choice. So
                    we got him. I mention that episode to show the importance that Personnel placed
                    on assignments to the Secretary's office. They were of course right and made my
                    job a great pleasure; I didn't have too many problems.</p>
                <p>We had the same situation when Bob Anderson, George Ball's special assistant,
                    left. There George Springsteen made these selection. He didn't get files on any
                    “deadwood”. He had trouble making the decision.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>I also had no problem with financial resources. I got all the money for travel
                    and other needs as I requested them. We of course had access to the special
                    confidential fun; that helped a lot to carry out some of the operations of the
                    Seventh Floor. We were always concerned about travel costs because those funds
                    were in short supply in the whole Department. But when a Seventh Floor principal
                    had to go, we always found the money. It was the straphangers that gave us
                    problems from time to time. It is difficult to keep the Secretary's party down
                    to manageable proportions; that was the big headache.</p>
                <p>All in all, it was very interesting job. I spent a lot of hours in my office, but
                    they were pleasurable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1966, you were off to London as the Counselor for
                        Administration. Did this also come out of the clear blue sky?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SKOUFIS: It certainly did. I got a call sometime in February, 1966, telling me
                    that my name was on a list for a senior training assignment, either the War
                    College or the Senior Seminar. I had been in S/S for about two years at the time
                    and I was happy to go to school. Sometime in the middle of May, I got a call
                    from Fred Irving, at that time the Executive Director of the Bureau of European
                    Affairs, telling me that he was putting me on a list of people to replace
                    Findley Burns in London. I told Fred that I thought I was going to the senior
                    training although I had not heard anything more since the call in February. I
                    knew from my own experience that I would have gotten the official word in July.
                    Fred told me that he had already checked my possible assignment with Bill
                    Boswell in Personnel. I said : “Fine; if all agree, it is OK with me”. About
                    two-three weeks later, I got a call from Boswell, who in his usual dramatic
                    fashion, said: “Damn you, I thought you said you wanted to go to senior
                    training”. I told him that I was told that I would go to senior training; I had
                    really not been asked. He then told me that I had been approved to go to London
                    as the Counselor for Administration. He seemed quite upset. He then asked: “Do
                    you want to go to the War College or London?” At that time, no one got an
                    assignment to the War College until it was all over. Here I had an opportunity
                    to go to London to do the administrative work; it was the job that people like
                    myself dreamt about. So I told him “London”. And that is where I went.</p>
                <p>A few days later, Fred Irving called and said: “You guys better get ready to go
                    to London in a hurry”. I said: “What do you mean: you guys?”. Fred said that
                    both Jack Herfurt and I were assigned to London; he was going to be the Consul
                    General. He wanted both of us to get to London in a hurry because Findley's
                    appointment as Ambassador to Jordan had been announced and Ambassador Bruce
                    didn't want too much of a gap. So Jack and I got on a boat in the middle of June
                    for England. When I got to London, I found that poor Findley had a medical
                    problem and he didn't leave the post for four weeks. So in the interim, I was
                    extra baggage. We couldn't get into our house while the Burns were still in
                    London. I took a quick tour of the constituent posts during that month.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>Phil Kaiser was the DCM. It was very interesting assignment. Following Findley
                    Burns at a post is an experience. I went to London with some trepidation because
                    I realized that Findley had a very special relationship with the Ambassador. I
                    realized that in very short order. When I got to London, I found that all the
                    rush to get there had been somewhat exaggerated, although perhaps unavoidable.
                    Findley, as I said, was ill; he couldn't leave for his post as Ambassador to
                    Jordan. So I spent a lot of time being briefed. Therefore, the transition was
                    easy for me; I had a greater opportunity that is afforded to other newcomers to
                    learn both about the administrative operations and the people in London. We
                    lived first of all in a hotel; then we moved to temporary quarters in some staff
                    housing the U.S. government owned. Jack Herfurt was able to move into Consul
                    General's house right away.</p>
                <p>London, of course, was a large post and staffed by a good bunch of people. I
                    don't recall any major problems that required immediate attention. Findley had
                    developed a very smooth operation; it was clear that he ran the whole damn
                    business practically. I benefitted greatly from his sage counsel and advice. The
                    first problem I encountered was to fend off the political, economic and USIS
                    section, all of which wanted the offices that had been assigned to the
                    Administrative Counselor. All the Section heads were on the same floor with the
                    Ambassador; everybody wanted Findley's office upon his departure. It was lucky
                    there was an overlap; I might never had the same space if there had been a gap
                    between Findley and myself. Some of the other section chiefs had made their case
                    to Phil Kaiser, who told them that they better talk to me first. Of course, once
                    established, I was not about to move; it was one of the most delightful set-ups
                    you can imagine in an Embassy, particularly for an Administrative Counselor.
                    Findley had warned me not to be pushed off that floor and downstairs; it would
                    just downgrade the administrative section and was very much opposed to it. As it
                    turned out, I was in London for five years and held on to the same office for
                    all that time. I learned later that one of my successors did give up that office
                    suite and moved to another part of the building. We also had one of the great
                    houses in London in a beautiful area of the city.</p>

                <p>Findley was good act to follow. During his time, the Embassy had fallen heir to a
                    lot of homes that had been relinquished by the MAAG mission. The MAAG to the UK
                    had been a sizeable contingent which was phased out. They left us several good
                    properties, including the one that became the residence of the Administrative
                    Counselor. It was a delightful place within walking distance of the Chancery.
                    The accommodations were beautiful and were well furnished. I was surprised that
                    all the government properties in London had been upgraded in terms of furniture
                    and furnishings. They all looked great. It had been FBO funds that had been used
                    for this purpose. I was surprised that the FBO allotment for the maintenance of
                    the residences was rather generous. It became even more generous when Ambassador
                    Bruce refused to use any of it for his residence. I reviewed all our properties,
                    including the Ambassador's residence, to which he invited me for lunch and then
                    gave me a guided tour. It was clear that a lot of work needed to be done
                    there—painting, new drapes, new covers for the furniture—, but the Ambassador
                    had a couple of dogs which behaved like all dogs. The Ambassador said that he
                    wanted his residence just in that way. He said that if he let us administrative
                    types into the house, we would never get out. He thought that he didn't have
                    much more time in London anyway and therefore wouldn't let any of us in. He told
                    me that if FBO allotted the post any money for his residence, I was to use for
                    other residences. He didn't want it returned, but he was not going to use it for
                    his residence. Therefore, we spent practically nothing on the Ambassador's
                    residence. When Ambassador Annenberg came—he was accustomed to living well—, he
                    immediately set about refurbishing the residence at his own expense.</p>
                <p>Tom Hughes, who had been the Director of INR, came to London, as the DCM. This
                    was his first experience in the Foreign Service although he knew a lot of
                    Britishers. It was a learning experience for him, but unfortunately he only
                    stayed for a year or so because of his wife's medical problems. Then there was
                    another hiatus, but it was not significant for me because we all continued to
                    report to the Ambassador as we had done since Mr. Annenberg had arrived. As a
                    matter of fact, we had an inspection team in London, headed by Bob McClintock,
                    at the time; it couldn't understand how a large Embassy like London could
                    operate so well without a DCM. The team couldn't understand why the Department
                    was not more anxious to fill the DCM job. The fact was that we operated very
                    well even without a DCM. McClintock described the situation as a “very unique
                    management situation. The Ambassador runs the whole show through a college of
                    counselors”. The section chiefs coordinated well and the Embassy functioned
                    quite well. What it had was an Ambassador who was quite willing to assume a
                    management role. But you have to understand that Ambassador Annenberg didn't
                    have much input in terms of the political or economic situation of the country,
                    in terms of understanding the country. He had to rely on the professional staff
                    to do that. His relationships with me were probably more frequent than with any
                    other section chief; when I went to talk “budgets” with him, he knew what I was
                    talking about immediately. He learned quickly on how we got our money, how we
                    could spend it and whether we had enough; he learned very quickly how the
                    Department worked. It was a very interesting experience for an administrative
                    counselor.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>Ambassador Annenberg did develop a lot of contacts through social activities. He
                    entertained royally and I do mean “royally”. If you got an invitation to a table
                    at the Annenberg residence, you were in the upper class. He used the best china,
                    the best wines, the best silverware—his collections were gorgeous. The staff was
                    greatly impressed. One day, he asked me what his car was. Ambassador Bruce had
                    never used a Cadillac; he had decided that London was not a good place for it.
                    So we had a Chrysler or a big Pontiac. The Bruces had two personal cars: a
                    Jaguar and a Mercedes. She drove the Jaguar and when he wanted to go off by
                    himself, he used the Mercedes. Of course, the official car and chauffeurs were
                    available at all times. We had a couple of chauffeurs dedicated to the
                    Ambassador's car. Ambassador Bruce was very kind to the motor pool and since he
                    knew his way around London, used to go by himself. We didn't have to take them
                    to all their dinner parties. However, that situation changed; neither Annenbergs
                    drove, although he brought his own Rolls Royce from Philadelphia. But one of the
                    first things that Ambassador Annenberg wanted was a Cadillac. That was easy to
                    do; all I did was call Bob Peck, then Director of Operations in the Department,
                    who said that he had been expecting that call because I guess London was the
                    only post that did not have a Cadillac. Undoubtedly, in briefing Ambassador
                    Annenberg, someone told him that he was eligible to have a Cadillac. So the
                    problem was not in procuring the car; the problem arose in how to get it there.
                    I kept getting promised of shipping dates, but there seemed always to be a
                    problem—for example, whether it would be right or left-hand drive. One day, we
                    got word that President Nixon would be visiting London again. The Ambassador
                    quite rightly was concerned that there would no Cadillac for the President. The
                    Bob Peck really came through. He got the Cadillac driven to Dover Air Force Base
                    in Delaware, where it was loaded on a cargo plane and delivered to an Air Force
                    Base in England. We picked it up there and finally had a Cadillac. We used the
                    rationale that the Cadillac was necessary for the Presidential visit, which it
                    was.</p>
                <p>They had a driver from the motor pool whom they liked and he was assigned full
                    time to drive the Annenbergs. The Embassy of course provided all the
                    transportation he needed, but the Ambassador knew that he needed a driver for
                    his wife, who had her own schedule of events. So we took a driver out of the
                    motor pool, put him on administrative leave without pay and the ambassador
                    picked up his salary. That driver kept his re-employment rights and whenever his
                    colleagues got raises, the Ambassador would increase the driver's salary as
                    well. That way, there was no issue about using a government employee to
                    chauffeur Mrs. Annenberg around. This was an illustration of the Ambassador's
                    general approach which was not in any way embarrass “his President” by using an
                    official car and driver to transport Mrs. Annenberg around. It was a pleasure to
                    work for an ambassador like that. That was the kind of guy Ambassador Annenberg
                    was.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>After Tom Hughes' departure, as I said, there was a hiatus. Then we learned that
                    Jerry Greene was coming as DCM. He was a professional Foreign Service officer,
                    who had been in the Service for many years. His reputation was excellent. I
                    hadn't known him before, but we became well acquainted after he arrived because
                    he was to be my boss. We briefed him on how we had operated. He worked his way
                    in slowly, learning about the post and trying to win the confidence of the
                    Ambassador. It was clear that when he arrived, Ambassador Annenberg had some
                    questions about the need for DCM. But Jerry was very good, establishing good
                    relationships with all the sections of the Embassy. The Ambassador insisted that
                    we continue to meet with him on a weekly basis. We all reported to the
                    Ambassador, but I, as well as other section chiefs, made sure that Jerry knew
                    what we were going to discuss with the Ambassador. This enabled him to have an
                    input, so that he didn't feel left out. Herfurt made an effort to include him as
                    well as Bill Galloway, the Political Counselor and others. But it was clear that
                    the Ambassador was running the show. Then came performance evaluation time. I
                    gave out the forms and set a schedule for completion. I gave the Counselors'
                    forms to Jerry Greene; that was standard procedure in the Foreign Service. The
                    DCM was the rating officer and the Ambassador was the reviewing officer. So
                    Jerry drafted the ratings and showed them to us. Then he sent them to the
                    Ambassador. One day, I got a call from the Ambassador who wished to see me right
                    away. When I got into his office, he showed me the ratings and said: “What are
                    all these things?” I explained what they were and the system that we used to
                    rate officers. He then asked: “But why is Jerry writing them? The section chiefs
                    work for me!”. I told him that that was correct, but that was the way the system
                    worked. He told me to take those ratings back and to send him fresh forms. I
                    told him that he would have the last word as reviewing officer. But he insisted
                    that he wanted to be the rating officer; he wanted to know why he couldn't be
                    the rating officer if he wished to be so. I told him that if he wanted that,
                    that is the way it would be. So I went back to Jerry to tell him what had
                    happened. Jerry blew his stack. He told me not to do anything until he called
                    me. So I went back to my office and sat on the ratings. The next day, Jerry
                    called and said: “Pete, send the new forms to the Ambassador. I am leaving! He
                    doesn't need me”. Jerry talked to someone in the Department and got another
                    assignment after only about one year. To be honest, I didn't blame him. It was
                    clear that the Ambassador didn't want or needed a DCM. The Ambassador the
                    reports, but they were very sparsely written. They had no depth like the ones
                    written by Foreign Service officers. I mean that for me he probably wrote:
                    “Skoufis is the best administrative guy I have ever met”. Period. For Herfurt he
                    wrote: “He is the best Consul General I have ever met”. They were all very
                    laudatory, but I don't think they were going to do any of us any good. I talked
                    to Jerry about the situation; he suggested that I send them in as I had to do,
                    with an explanatory note of what had happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: London had always been known for having morale problems,
                        particularly among the staff employees. Was that true when you were there?
                        How did it manifest itself? What was done about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>SKOUFIS: It was true. It was a very difficult situation. It was difficult to deal
                    with because of certain basic assumptions that had been made. London was a large
                    post and as many of its counterparts was somewhat impersonal. A good percentage
                    of the staff employees would go their own way after work. Many, particularly
                    those with small families, lived in government housing, but some secretaries
                    lived in private quarters—apartments that were affordable within their
                    allowances. A lot of morale problems came to my attention because several of the
                    girls explained to me why they didn't like serving in posts like London, Paris
                    or Rome. They had served previously in African posts where their social life
                    centered around activities sponsored or encouraged by the Embassy. That was
                    absent in London; we did very little for the Embassy staff as a group. We didn't
                    have group outings or parties, except for the Marines who would have parties at
                    their quarters. We had a sizeable Marine contingent and they hosted TGIF
                    parties. But in general, the Embassy did not sponsor organized activities. When
                    I discussed this issue with our personnel people, we felt that there wasn't any
                    need for it. The resourceful people found plenty to do. London and England were
                    full of activities. You could travel up and down the country; you could travel
                    to Europe. A lot of people took advantage of those opportunities and they were
                    no problem. But there was this group of Foreign Service staffers who had become
                    dependent on an Embassy to do things for them; they felt when those services
                    were not provided, it was somehow unfair. That created quite a morale problem.
                    As I said, most of those who had a morale problem had come from posts where the
                    Embassy took care of them 24 hours every day. They had a problem.</p>
                <p>We did not have too much of a problem with the working conditions because there
                    was a wide inter-change among sections. The various section chiefs tried very
                    hard to bring their staff employees, mostly the female secretaries, into their
                    homes whenever there were appropriate social occasions. I had to do a lot of
                    that with my own people, most of whom were in the communications section. They
                    were primarily single and many of whom had low morale. The communicators found
                    it difficult to have a satisfactory tour because of their working hours. Perhaps
                    we might have done more, but after all these people were not serving in a
                    country with a different language.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>There was some tensions created by the “staff vs. officers” syndrome. It was more
                    evident in London than in any other post I have served in. Somehow the staff
                    felt it was “second class”. Maybe it was because the professionals had such an
                    interesting life, both in the office and socially. This feeling of “second
                    class” ran even through some of the consular staff. The consular staff worked
                    very hard; they were overburdened. That was one of our major headaches. We
                    insisted that the British had passports and visas for any trips they took to the
                    U.S. So there were always lines outside the Embassy. The people in the consular
                    section started at nine and didn't get a break until five when they went home.
                    It was that kind of operation. The workload created a lot of morale problems. I
                    think Herfurt did a great job. He included his people in functions at his house;
                    he gave them as much time off as he could. But undoubtedly, the consular staff
                    was the hardest working group in the Embassy. No other Embassy section worked as
                    hard as the consular section. Certainly no one in the administrative section
                    did. But this unevenness of workload contributed to the low morale of the
                    consular staff.</p>
                <p>We all were aware that we had a morale problem; very few of these people would
                    ask to be returned to London for another tour. Many did not consider being
                    assigned to London as being a reward for having served in Africa. Many asked to
                    be sent back to Africa after just a few months in London. For certain categories
                    of staff, big posts are just not an appropriate assignment. One would think that
                    England would have been one of the easiest posts for anyone—no language problem,
                    favorable cost-of-living, plenty of cultural opportunities at reasonable prices,
                    unlike Paris where you couldn't afford to take advantage of the opportunities
                    even if you wanted. London had PX facilities; we had all of the creature
                    comforts, but there was that feeling of belonging to an “Embassy family” that
                    was lacking. That was hard to create at a post the size of London.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>London was a most gratifying assignment. I was there, as I mentioned, for five
                    years. After my home leave, I got back to London and received a call from the
                    then Executive Director of the Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs, advising me that
                    he was going to recommend me for the administrative counselor job in Tokyo which
                    was coming open. I said: “Fine”. After three years in London, I was not
                    surprised that someone in the Department, in his wisdom, would have thought that
                    I had been in London long enough. So the Department sent a cable which went to
                    the Ambassador who called me. He wanted to know what this proposed transfer was
                    all about. He wanted to know if I was trying to leave London. I said quickly:
                    “No, sir! But I have been here three years and I assume the Department wants
                    some one else here. We are all part of a system and we go where the system sends
                    us”. He couldn't understand why I was being sent to somewhere else when I didn't
                    want to leave London. I had originally told him that I was supposed to be in
                    London for five years, but that the Department had the right and often invoked
                    it to break tours whenever it wished. He finally said: “If you don't want to go,
                    you are not going!” I said: “Thank you, Mr. Ambassador” and walked out. The
                    Ambassador called Bill Macomber and told him that he had understood that he
                    could keep his staff and now the Department was pulling people out. He said that
                    he didn't want me to go. Shortly thereafter, I got a call from Bill Macomber
                    wanting to know what I was trying to do by sicking the Ambassador on him. I
                    assured Bill that I had not done that and then I reviewed my conversation with
                    the Ambassador. The latter thought that what I was doing for him and the Embassy
                    in London was just as important as anything I might for in Tokyo and therefore
                    saw no reason for a move. That was the end of my transfer to Tokyo.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>About a year later, or perhaps even sooner, I got a call from the then Director
                    General, John Burns, saying that Graham Martin had just called from Saigon
                    saying that he wanted me to join his staff as the Administrative Counselor.
                    Burns said that he would propose that assignment. I told Burns that before he
                    did anything, he'd better check with Macomber. I told him that I thought all
                    bases had to be touched before this idea went much further in light of the
                    previous effort to re-assign me. Burns said not to worry; that he could handle
                    it. So a cable came to London, announcing that I had been assigned to Saigon to
                    replace Theo Hall who was leaving. It also said that Graham Martin had requested
                    my assignment. I had known Graham as did almost every one who had been in the
                    administrative field. Ambassador Annenberg called me and we went through the
                    same procedure. He said: “Skoufis, I thought you were going to stay here five
                    years. What are you up to now?” I repeated to him what I had told him earlier
                    about the Department's assignment process. I told him that Department could make
                    any assignments it wished and that in this particular case, Vietnam had the
                    highest priority. He then asked again: “Do you want to go or not?”. This time I
                    told him that I certainly did not want to go. He said: “I want you to stay
                    here!” I told him that was fine with me, but that if the Department ordered my
                    transfer, I would have to go or quit. The Ambassador repeated that he wanted me
                    stay in London. Somehow, he seemed to feel that I was encouraging these
                    transfers and I certainly was not. No one in his right mind would lobby to leave
                    London to go to Vietnam or even Tokyo. So once again, Ambassador Annenberg
                    called Washington, to Macomber, I would guess. Sure enough, another cable came
                    from John Burns, canceling the Saigon assignment, but that at the end of my tour
                    of duty in London, I would be considered for the Vietnam position. That was fine
                    with me; I didn't care. So I stayed in London for five years. Very happy and
                    still interesting even at the end. I suspect that weren't many officers who
                    stayed in London that long and I only managed because of Ambassador Annenberg.
                    He did the same thing for Bill Galloway, Jack Herfurt (he may have stayed for
                    eight years. He didn't want to go anywhere; he just wanted to stay in London
                    until he was eligible to retire. Galloway was there also for a long time. He
                    also didn't want to go anywhere else).</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>When my five years were up, I told the Ambassador that I was not going to ask for
                    an extension. I would have been crazy to do so after my experiences. I got a
                    call from some one in Washington who told me that Ambassador Watson in Paris had
                    requested that I replace Ralph Scarrit. I said that I didn't think that Scarrit
                    had been in Paris long enough to be ready for re-assignment. The answer was:
                    “The Ambassador wants you to replace Scarrit!”. I knew Watson; he used to fly
                    over from Paris in his own airplane. He loved to go to the Navy PX. He also
                    shopped elsewhere and went to the theater, with his wife and children. He would
                    also visit the Embassy where we would greet him and he would talk to Ambassador
                    Annenberg. So I got to know him; he was a “hail, well met” fellow. As soon as I
                    hung up from that call from Washington, I immediately called Perry Culley who
                    was the DCM in Paris. I wanted to find out what the score was. Perry started to
                    laugh. It was clear that he had cranked up this plot and had convinced the
                    Ambassador that I was available. Culley of course knew that my five years were
                    expiring and therefore had to be re-assigned. I had previously told him that I
                    was supposed to go to Vietnam. I think he talked to John Burns, who really
                    didn't care because he was leaving. So Culley assured me that the assignment was
                    mine, if I wanted it. It didn't take me long to agree. Who wouldn't want to go
                    to Paris? I then told Ambassador Annenberg about the Paris assignment. He said
                    he knew all about it because his good friend, Dick Watson, had called him to ask
                    about me. He said: “Of course, I had to tell him the truth!”.</p>
                <p>We had the packers at our house on Friday night and that weekend we drove to
                    Paris on a direct transfer (that was the only condition: no home leave that
                    year). On Monday morning, the moving van was in front of our apartment house in
                    Paris. Helen and I and our maid, whom we had brought from London, got out of our
                    car and began to unpack. Three days later, I was at work at the Embassy, when I
                    found out what had happened to poor Ralph Scarrit. He had run into a buzz saw
                    with the Ambassador. FBO was refurbishing the Rothschild House on Rue St.
                    Honore, which was the official residence. It had been a long term project moving
                    from an empty building to an office for USIS to being a residence and then
                    becoming the ambassador's residence after Congress had appropriated something
                    like a million dollars. Wayne Hayes and Rooney were both instrumental in doing
                    this. The idea was to restore the Rothschild House as a new residence for the
                    Ambassador; then we would sell the Avenue D'Iena residential property, which was
                    near the Eiffel Tower. This was property that the U.S. government had acquired
                    in 1924. It was small and had outlived its usefulness; it had needed a lot of
                    work, but it was a very valuable piece of real estate. FBO had surveyed the
                    situation and had concluded that they could fix the Rothschild House for one
                    million dollars and sell the old residence for two and a half million. So it was
                    net gain for the U.S. government.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>So the project got underway. Ralph had worked very closely with FBO on it; as a
                    matter of fact, Leo Riordan of FBO was stationed in Paris to supervise the work.
                    There was a personality problem. On a couple of occasions, Ralph had told the
                    ambassador that there were certain things that couldn't be done. If you have to
                    say “No” to an Ambassador, you better do it very diplomatically, particularly if
                    you are dealing with a titan of industry like Mr. Watson. His father had been
                    the head of IBM and he had had a big role in the same company. These guys are
                    not accustomed to hearing that the rules didn't allow for something they wanted.
                    Apparently Watson's position was that if his wife wanted something, she would
                    get it. So sooner rather than later, both Ralph and Leo were transferred. So the
                    problem was left to me. It was a real headache in terms of finishing the job in
                    time for a move that had been scheduled long ago. Of course, both Mr. and Mrs.
                    Watson were changing the work constantly which didn't help the time schedule.
                    They weren't fussy, but there were some changes they insisted on. The money was
                    being consumed rapidly; there were special panels and cornishes and art work
                    that had to be restored. It was very expensive work. The Ambassador himself had
                    contributed something like $400,000 in addition to the appropriation to keep the
                    project going. Most of his money went to buy furniture. It was a funny process.
                    Joe Donelan was back in the Department at the time and was following the
                    project. The Deputy Secretary was John Irvin, who was the Ambassador's
                    brother-in-law. My problem was trying to convince the Ambassador that we had to
                    work within a frame-work, particularly a financial one. When it came time to
                    move, we noticed that several things had fallen between the cracks. Part of it
                    was due that the whole project was financed by a number of allocations and that
                    created problems. We had to pay for something out of one pocket and for others
                    out of another. I could manage that because my mission was to move the Watson's
                    into the new residence on time for a Fourth of July party. That was the target.
                    We had to landscape the gardens.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>We finally put together a group that was called “The Friends of 41”, because that
                    was the address of the residence on St. Honore. These were public-spirited
                    Americans who lived in Paris; they raised funds to purchase some items for the
                    residence. One of the members was Randy Kidder and his wife; he was a former
                    Foreign Service officer who became the President of the group. It was a very
                    effective device to raise money; their donations became tax deductible. They
                    bought carpets, etc. It was someone else's idea, but I developed and brought
                    into being. Watson's contributions similarly were tax deductible. One time, the
                    FBO supervisor came from Washington and made a “walk through”. At the end of it,
                    he declared the FBO role as finished with what ever was left being the Embassy's
                    responsibility. I balked at that. For example, there was a powder room
                    downstairs which did not have toilet paper dispenser in it. The roll of toilet
                    paper sat on top of the tank. He told me that was my problem, not his. I pointed
                    out to him that small problems like that multiplied by the many bathrooms the
                    residence had (I think there must have been twenty) were a major headache and
                    expense. I learned later that there were even difficulties in obtaining toilet
                    seats not to mention other bathroom fixtures. But FBO insisted that those costs
                    come out of the post's Maintenance and Repair budget and that it would not
                    increase our allocation. I needed another $200,000 to get the house ready; just
                    to put the finishing touches on it, light bulbs for the chandelier, etc. So I
                    finally called Joe who came through with the necessary funds. I told him that
                    unless I was able to complete the job, I too would be thrown out and the
                    Department would have to find another Administrative Counselor; the Department
                    might as well cough up the dough then because otherwise it might cost even more.
                    In the final analysis, the new residence turned out to be a great success and it
                    was finished in time for the Fourth of July party. After getting that job done,
                    I was in pretty good shape with the Ambassador who turned out to be a very nice
                    guy and a remarkable man.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>He was the heir to one of the great fortunes of the world; he was extremely
                    wealthy. He had his wife and six children at the post—three boys and three
                    girls. Some were teenagers and in some difficulties from time to time. He wanted
                    to do everything he could to keep his family together; so he converted an
                    upstairs room into a game room. He bought them a juke box, he bought them a pin
                    ball game machine, he built a movie theater for them. He paid all of that from
                    his own pockets. He did have a very difficult personality. A normal human being
                    has a range of emotions from low to high; Watson was on the extreme of that
                    range at both ends. When he was low, he was the meanest son of bitch you have
                    ever seen. And I mean “mean”. He was mean to his wife, his children, everybody.
                    When he was up, there wasn't a more generous guy around. He would take me to
                    lunch to “Tour de Jacques”. We would sit around and chat. I wondered whether he
                    was just lonesome, but it was just his way of trying to be a nice guy.
                    Sometimes, he would call and tell me that I was working too hard; he would then
                    ask me to come to his office and look at the entrance to the Chancery wondering
                    who was parked out there. Sometimes it was our representative to the OECD whose
                    chauffeured car was parked outside. He would then tell me that there wasn't any
                    parking allowed there and if the OECD man wanted to park, he should go into the
                    parking garage. He just didn't want anyone parking in front of the entrance
                    which he over-looked. That was the kind of guy he was. He was a man of
                    tremendous contrasts which was his undoing. He was a heavy drinker, although it
                    was controlled during the day. I never saw him drunk in the office. Helen and I
                    would be invited to the residence periodically with other staff members to see
                    movies—he had a tie in with a movie distributor so he and his kids could see
                    American movies before they were shown in Paris. He would then drink a few
                    scotches and before the evening was over, he was asleep. That was not an
                    uncommon event. One time, he came home on an American passenger aircraft and
                    made a pass at one of the stewardesses. That got into the papers after she
                    reported the event. That forced him to resign.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Watson was a very lovely and charming lady. She was easy to work with and
                    not very demanding. Very nice. The children were not spoiled brats because she
                    made sure that it wasn't going to happen. Mr. Watson had his own plane in Paris,
                    as I mentioned. There was a crew of, I think, three people, whom he paid out of
                    his own pockets. He was also a pilot so that he would fly the plane himself on
                    occasions. He didn't travel that often, but he did go to England several times
                    and to Vienna to a Chiefs of Mission conference. I don't think he ever flew his
                    plane to the States.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>My office was just under his. After I first arrived, he used to come down the
                    steps. There was a IBM copying machine in the corridor outside my office. He
                    wanted to know where we had gotten it. I said I didn't know. He said: “Get it
                    the hell out of here. I don't want to see any IBM equipment in the offices. The
                    next thing you know, there will be stories in the papers”. I told him that we
                    were just in the process of re-equipping the Embassy with IBM electric
                    typewriters. He said that was OK, because that was part of a general government
                    contract worked out in Washington. It turned out that the copying machine was
                    there because the IBM Paris office asked us to try it out; if we had found it
                    satisfactory we would have bought some. But after the Ambassador's comments, it
                    went out. In any case, he came downstairs one day with an envelope full of
                    gasoline receipts for his airplane. He wanted to know if he could get
                    reimbursement for the taxes that were paid, as we did in the Embassy whenever we
                    bought gas for our cars. I told him that I would see if that could be done. I
                    sent a note to the Foreign Office. Then I got a call from the Protocol Office
                    which said that it had no precedent for my request—they never had had an
                    Ambassador with his own airplane. But I said that the logic would seem to apply;
                    if gasoline for our cars were tax exempt, then the same rules should apply to
                    the gasoline for the Ambassador's airplane. The Protocol Officer agreed and in
                    due course, the Ambassador got his reimbursement. Of course, the French had to
                    establish a new procedure and that took some time, but I was told to assure the
                    Ambassador that his taxes would be reimbursed. I said that I didn't think the
                    money was an issue, but that the Ambassador saw it as a matter of principle.</p>
                <p>One day, he told me that people were making long distance calls on the Embassy
                    system. He asked me whether all the calls were business related. I said: “They'd
                    better be!”. He wanted to know how I could assure him of that. He instructed me
                    to put a pay station in the Embassy. He then told me that in IBM his father had
                    the phone system so rigged that when any IBM official wanted to make a
                    long-distance call to Europe, a red light would flash in his father's office.
                    That was one of IBM's early fetishes, some of which the son brought with him. So
                    we put a telephone pay station in the Chancery. Of course, no one used it. That
                    was the kind of person Ambassador Watson was. He got along with the French quite
                    well. He spoke French; he had been educated in France and had spent a good deal
                    of time there when IBM was starting in France. That is where the headquarters of
                    IBM World Trade was established; there was a big IBM complex just in back of the
                    Embassy where both the European and France offices were located. So he had spent
                    considerable time in France before becoming ambassador. Of course, through him,
                    we met many of the IBM people. He would see them socially, but I not aware that
                    he ever intervened on IBM's behalf. He tried to be very careful about those
                    relationships, as my story about the copier illustrates. Ambassador Watson was
                    also a very generous patron of the American school which was attended by all his
                    children.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>In any case, serving with Ambassador Watson was a very interesting experience. He
                    was the Republican member of the family; his brother, Tom, was a Democrat. The
                    family covered both sides. Tom later went to the USSR as Ambassador in the
                    Carter administration. Shortly after Arthur Watson left Paris, his
                    brother-in-law, John Irvin was appointed. The contrast in personalities was
                    amazing. Ambassador Irvin was as fine a gentleman as you would ever want to
                    meet. He was a widower—his wife, a Watson, had passed away some years earlier.
                    He came to Paris with his son and daughter who were young teen-agers at the
                    time. It was a lovely family; the Ambassador was very devoted to his two
                    children. They went to school in Paris, although the son eventually returned to
                    the States to complete his education. Irvin had been the Deputy Secretary and
                    therefore knew the system well. We had no problem in running the Embassy. He
                    spoke French and had a very good relationship with the French. Culley, who had
                    been the DCM, retired when Watson did and became the head of the American
                    Hospital in Paris. The new DCM was Jack Kubisch with whom I worked closely. The
                    Paris Embassy became a very conventional and good operation. There were no major
                    problems.</p>
                <p>The major difference between London and Paris was in the ambassadorial style of
                    the two principals. Annenberg ran his Embassy differently from a traditional
                    style. Paris was much more the norm. Both were big Embassies with their usual
                    problems. A freeze on travel, for example, which occurred from time to time took
                    its toll on morale. Fortunately, it didn't happen very often, but when it did it
                    had a bigger impact because more people were involved. My biggest problem in
                    Paris was a financial one because the rate of exchange between the dollar and
                    the franc kept changing in favor of the franc. It had been 6:1 or 7:1 or 8:1; it
                    slid down to 3.8:1. It was very hard for the Department to obtain more dollars
                    to match these changes in exchange rates. I remember very vividly the time we
                    had to do a local wage survey; we were way behind on our pay scales because we
                    had not been able to keep up with the inflation that was occurring in France.
                    The Department sent a team to make the survey which showed that a sizeable
                    increase was due to our local employees. We were faced with a very touchy
                    situation; there was some discussion of a strike. Fortunately nothing developed.
                    I finally convinced the Department to approve the new wage scale by surrendering
                    a number of local positions; we cut back on motor pool services; we cut
                    positions out of the administrative section and forced other sections to cut
                    back as well. Those reductions, which included American positions as well,
                    enable EUR finally to finance the new wage scale. That was an example of the
                    kind of administrative problems we had to face.</p>
                <p>Both London and Paris were qualitatively well staffed. Those posts attracted very
                    good officers; the section chiefs were all good. Hank Cohen was the head of the
                    Political Section; Allen Holmes was there. Many of the staff became ambassadors
                    later and you could tell that would be so even in their junior years. They were
                    sharp.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>We had a very good relationship with other agencies. In both London and Paris we
                    went through the periodic reduction of staffs exercises (BALPA, for example). In
                    London we surveyed all U.S. government activities in England. We found several
                    military units that were remnants of World War II—assessing damage from
                    strategic bombings, etc. But we told the Department that these units were the
                    responsibilities of the DoD and that the Embassy would not pass judgment on
                    them, but would look at all civilian activities. We found a guy in North
                    Scotland from the Weather Bureau which was a part of the Department of Commerce.
                    His job was to send balloons up to test the weather over the Arctic or
                    somewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in 1975, you were appointed as Deputy Inspector
                        Genera. Did you want to make a comment about the Inspection Corps of the
                        mid-70s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SKOUFIS: At the time, we were getting good people for the Inspection Corps. We
                    managed to upgrade the quality of the Inspectors and usually had a former
                    Ambassador as the Chief Inspector. Bob Sayre tried very hard to put some meat on
                    the bones of the structure; he was trying to make it more meaningful and to try
                    to develop more significant measures of posts' effectiveness. There was a group
                    in the Department which was trying to make the same judgment through a
                    computerized system. That was being done in the Office of Management (M/MO)
                    first (later it was transferred to the Information Systems Office) through a
                    system called “Management by Objectives”. The project was headed by Clayton
                    McManaway, who used to head M/MO. The idea was to establish some objectives for
                    each of an Embassy's section and then to measure progress towards meeting those
                    objectives through the use of a computer. Their hopes were to find objectives
                    that would be common to all posts in the Foreign Service giving come leeway
                    obviously for peculiar requirements. I worked on that team as the representative
                    of the Inspector General because we were going to use this management tool. That
                    Task Force met practically throughout my eighteen months in the IG. It was not
                    an easy job because we had to draw on the substantive officers to talk to us
                    about their objectives and then we had to talk to the computer programmers who
                    had had develop the software necessary to make the information useful. But it
                    was a very interesting exercise, trying to develop a measuring device so that
                    you could have some standards for measurements and comparisons among posts. It
                    would have been more accurate that the subjective measures that a variety of
                    inspectors were applying. I thought the idea showed some promise, but it moved
                    very slowly partly because of the difficulties of the project itself. First, it
                    was very hard to figure out what posts should be doing and then we had to
                    categorize posts by certain criteria. The system was also an attempt to get a
                    better handle on how a post should be staffed. The assumption was that given a
                    certain objectives, one could then determine how many people it would take to
                    reach them. It was all good in theories and may be possible to implement a
                    program like that today, but we certainly weren't able to do so fifteen years
                    ago.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>It was not the first time that such an effort had been undertaken. The first
                    birth, I think, was under Crockett ten years earlier. This was an Eagleburger
                    reincarnation. In any case, Sayre was trying to do something with this concept;
                    he himself was a pretty good manager. The Inspector General was formally
                    reporting to the Secretary, but in fact, his more frequent contacts were with
                    the Under Secretary for Management (M). Bob liked the concept of “M”; he thought
                    that it was a good idea that might be able to overcome some of the bureaucratic
                    inertia that had set in the administrative area. That area had slowed down
                    considerably; things were not happening in the “A” area.</p>
                <p>The job of Deputy Inspector General was very interesting. I was the number two
                    deputy; the senior deputy was Bob Yost, who concerned himself with substantive
                    issues. When Sayre and Yost happened to be out of town, which happened on a
                    couple of occasions, I used to attend the Secretary's large weekly staff
                    meetings. It was a very interesting job. We were briefed by personnel of other
                    agencies and by INR almost on a daily basis on what was going on in the world,
                    what the U.S. government's priorities seemed to be and what our efforts
                    were.</p>
                <p>My job included the recruitment of people for the Inspection Corps. It was a
                    collective effort with Ambassador Sayre having the last word, but I was supposed
                    to come up with the names of potential candidates. As I said, we got some good
                    officers, but we had difficulties getting female officers. I wanted Rozanne
                    Ridgway, but she got away from us. I talked to her and I thought we had her. She
                    had been a DCM, but she had a health problem so that she wasn't available for
                    travel. But we were never able to recruit a female officer.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>I had bought a house in Virginia and we had settled in. I was getting seriously
                    concerned about the government's pay schedule. I was bumping my head against the
                    ceiling; I had already been in the Foreign Service for 35 years (counting my
                    time in the military). In 1977, I did a few calculations. At the time, the
                    government insisted a deducting 7% from your pay-check for retirement purposes,
                    even though the annuity was fixed because 35 years was the maximum that could be
                    used to calculate retirement benefits. I was told that the law would be revised
                    to eliminate this unfairness. But in truth, I didn't see much action on the part
                    of the Department to get the law revised. I thought I was subsidizing the system
                    by giving it 7% of my pay without any possibility of a return. So I kept hitting
                    this ceiling and then I decided that I would look for other employment. I
                    prepared a resume of my 35 years of service. I made my availability known around
                    town. The Department had a retirement operation which was supposed to set up
                    interviews for those officers who wished or who had to retire. I got a couple of
                    interviews; both were very interesting jobs. I did not get one of them; that was
                    the job of Executive Director of Mt. Vernon—George Washington's residence. The
                    ladies that ran the place were looking for an Executive Director. I had a lovely
                    interview; they told me that I was just the kind of person they were looking for
                    and that they would let me know. I was quite encouraged. You would have had to
                    live in one of the houses on the grounds, which was a small drawback. Another
                    candidate was Harry Symmes, former Ambassador. In the final analysis, Harry got
                    the job which was good one which paid well. I also interviewed for a job at the
                    Meridian House; I think it was for the administrative position below the
                    President. They said they were interested in me, but I said that I didn't want
                    the job because the pay was very low—$12 or $13 thousand per year. They told me
                    that it was almost a volunteer job and it would have barely covered my
                    expenses.</p>
                <p>Then one day, I dropped a resume in the Bureau for International Organizations.
                    It was the clearing house in the Department for jobs in the United Nations.
                    Shortly afterwards, I got a call from IO telling me that the Director General of
                    FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) was coming to town and that he wanted an
                    American for the job of Assistant Director General for Administration and
                    Finance. IO said it had three or four people lined up and that it wanted me to
                    add my application. I was asked to fill out the U.N. forms which I did. In due
                    course, I had an interview with the Director General, Dr. Eduardo Saouma, a
                    Lebanese. He had been in agricultural field for many years; he had graduated
                    from the University of Montpellier in France. He explained that he wanted an
                    American for the administrative job. He explained the organization to me. He
                    said that there would be an American Deputy Director General who was going to
                    retire from the Department of Agriculture. I talked to him a little bit in
                    French because he seemed to be more at home in that language than he was in
                    English and of course by that time I could handle French quite well. He was
                    going to interview some one in New York and then would let me know.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>Over the Christmas holidays of 1976, I got a call from IO asking whether I could
                    go to Rome for a fuller interview with Dr. Saouma; I was among the finalists and
                    he wanted to see me in Rome. I was told that the Washington office of FAO would
                    supply me with a ticket. I said I thought it would be useless to go over the
                    holidays because from my experience, I thought that all would be closed. But I
                    was told to go to talk to the liaison office which confirmed in fact that FAO
                    would not be open until January 9. That was alright with me; I took a couple of
                    days of leave. They gave me first class air tickets and I flew to Rome. They put
                    me up in a very nice hotel. I was introduced to several members of Dr. Saouma's
                    immediate staff and I was interviewed by the Chef de Cabinet—his special
                    assistant. I was also interviewed by the Budget Director, Ed West, who was
                    English. He had the job when it was one job—budget and administration. In a
                    reorganization, the two functions were separated and Ed preferred the budget
                    job; so I was being considered for administration and finance. The Director
                    General prided himself of being a man of action; he was difficult type. Before I
                    left Rome, he told me that the job was mine.</p>
                <p>When I returned to Washington mid-January, I learned that Congress was
                    considering a pay raise for government employees, which would have meant a
                    sizeable increase for me. But it would not have been effective until February 1.
                    I had told Saouma that I could report sometime between March 1 and March 15
                    because I had to give some notice to Bob Sayre (he of course knew that I was
                    being interviewed but nothing about the timing). Of course, by staying on the
                    State payroll until the effective date of the pay raise, I would be paid my
                    terminal leave at the higher rate. I had a lot of leave and I think in all, it
                    added up to about a year's pay. I had a choice of being seconded, thereby
                    remaining on the State Department's pay role or to retire outright. I did the
                    arithmetic; the advantage of seconding was that I would get my in-grade pay
                    raises and would leave open the door for a return to the Foreign Service. But
                    financially, it was clear that retirement was the way to go. I would have
                    received my retirement pay and my FAO salary. That was a good financial deal;
                    the FAO emoluments were very generous and were tax-reimbursed (that is, I paid
                    the taxes to Uncle Sam, but FAO reimbursed me for them).</p>
                <p>In closing, I should say that I had a very interesting career in the Foreign
                    Service. Both Helen and I are very grateful for the opportunities provided us,
                    for the ambience in which we worked, the colleagues that I met over the years. I
                    come away with a feeling that I served really in the “Golden Age” of the Foreign
                    Service. Those years after World War II were very interesting and exciting years
                    for those interested in public service. I used to describe our tasks as public
                    service. It was a very satisfying and fulfilling job. I may have been unique in
                    terms of my assignments; I have no complaints about that, of course. But I had a
                    very rich experience; I don't know how my life could have been better and I am,
                    as I said, most grateful.</p>
