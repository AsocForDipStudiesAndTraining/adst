                <p>Initial interview date: June 18, 1987</p>

                <p>Subject: Admiral Wright's diplomatic experiences both in the United States Navy
                    and as Ambassador to the Republic of China between 1960 to 1968</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Admiral Wright, I wonder if you could give a little of the
                        background of your assignment to England and to General Eisenhower's staff,
                        and your experiences there dealing with the French.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, how far back do you want to go?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Go back wherever you'd like to go. I think, maybe, to get
                        a little flavor how you came to be assigned to such a position.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: First of all, after many years in the Navy, I was assigned to London to
                    be on the staff of Admiral Stark, who was then the Commander in Chief U.S. Naval
                    Forces in England. He had a staff in London at Grosvenor Square. Later, I was
                    assigned to General Eisenhower, who was then planning for Operation Torch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Torch being the invasion of Northern Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: That's right. His headquarters were in a building called Norfolk House in
                    London. And I was assigned to him as a staff officer to assist in the planning
                    for Operation Torch. As such, I was in intimate contact with Admiral Cunningham
                    of the Royal Navy, who was General Eisenhower's naval commander and later his
                    deputy for Operation Torch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">This was Andrew Cunningham?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, Andrew B. Cunningham. The decision was made — principally by Mr.
                    Robert Murphy — to engage in conversations with a group of French officers that
                    he had contacted in Algiers to assist in any way they could the American landing
                    there. Admiral Murphy was consul general in Algiers. He had been consul general
                    at Vichy, and he, as you know, was a very able and fine diplomatic officer. In
                    Algiers, as consul general, he contacted many French officers principally in the
                    Army who were, he presumed, sympathetic to the Allied cause and he had extensive
                    contacts of all those in North Africa whom he considered would be able to assist
                    us in the landing if we made it.Mr. Murphy organized or arranged for the
                    organization of a group of military officers, principally those on Eisenhower's
                    staff, to go to North Africa pre-D-Day by submarine and contact the French
                    officers that Mr. Murphy had considered would be of assistance to us in our
                    landing. The party, made up at the headquarters in London, consisted of General
                    Mark Clark and myself as a naval component, and General Lemnitzer, Colonel
                    Holmes and Colonel Hamlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">That was Julius Holmes, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Julius Holmes and Hamlin, the logistics officer on Eisenhower's
                    staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your position on Eisenhower's staff, your
                        particular field of expertise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I was a United States naval officer assigned to him to assist in planning
                    all aspects of the Torch operation. And my duty was to General Eisenhower and
                    also to Admiral A.B. Cunningham. I was assigned to this group that Mr. Murphy
                    and General Clark organized with the mission of convincing the French officers
                    in Africa to bring out the French fleet in Toulon, and to assist the Allied
                    cause in the event of our landings.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Accordingly, the five of us embarked at Gibraltar in a British submarine, the HMS
                    Sheraph, commanded by Lieutenant N.L.A. Jewell, and three British commandos, who
                    were assigned to us to do the pick-and-shovel work of handling radio and the
                    call box for landing and guns and ammunition and secret codes and devices which
                    would be useful to us in our landing. We flew by plane from England to Gibraltar
                    and there we met General McFarlane, who was the Barney Fawkes and who was in
                    command of the British submarine squadron generating in the Mediterranean. He
                    introduced us in turn to Lieutenant Jewell, who was the commanding officer of
                    the HMS Sheraph, the submarine that was designated to take us in. We boarded the
                    submarine — I forget the exact time — sometime in early October about two weeks
                    before D-Day. We headed towards a place called Cherchel on the coast of North
                    Africa between Oran and Algiers. There the submarine laid off the beach until we
                    got a signal from the house where we were to meet, which was a signal arranged
                    by Mr. [brief interruption]We arrived on the Cherchel beach and spotted the
                    farmhouse with the tower from which the signal should have been shown. There was
                    no signal shown so we had to lay off the beach for about ten hours waiting for
                    the signal from Murphy that would clear us to land. We finally got the signal
                    from the tower and indicated Murphy was there and was ready to start our
                    consultations with the French. We sent Julius Holmes ashore in the first kayak.
                    A kayak is a folding boat that could be carried on a submarine and launched
                    through the torpedo hatches. We sent Julius Holmes ashore in the first boat with
                    a commando. He contacted Murphy on the beach and sent us back a signal
                    indicating all was clear for the landing. So the rest of us embarked in the
                    remaining three kayaks — a total of five American officers and three commandos
                    for a total of eight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q:As a naval officer, did you Paddle much or were you in
                        command of your kayak? Was everybody paddling the kayak?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: We went ashore in kayaks. A kayak is a folding boat. It's a framework put
                    together by banded joints and a kind of skin pulled over the banded joints, and
                    it forms a kind of a kayak like is used in northern Greenland waters. Clark and
                    the head commando, whose name was Jumbo, embarked in the first kayak but Jim was
                    kind of a clumsy fellow, and he stepped on the gunnel of the kayak and broke it.
                    So Clark came back to the submarine and embarked me with him to paddle him
                    ashore. So Clark and I embarked in the Folbot kayak and paddled ashore, landing
                    dry-shod because the water was so completely smooth. We went in dry-shod in
                    these kayaks and there was Robert Murphy and our French friends, the owner of
                    the farmhouse arranged to conceal us in an empty wine cellar. In the meantime,
                    the French, who had been consulting with us, got going so fast that you could
                    hardly see their coattails going out of doors —going back to Algiers. But the
                    owner of the farmhouse stuck with us and ushered us into this empty wine cellar
                    and he and Murphy, searched for the missing pants and the missing money and the
                    missing papers, but Bob Murphy replied after about two days none of it had been
                    found. So the presumption was the boat had been sunk. It was decided on that
                    first day that one of the missions of our conversation with the French was to
                    determine the identity of a French general who would be able to command the
                    French forces and assist us in the landing. General Mast, who headed up our
                    meeting, who had been chief of staff to General Giraud, recommended that we get
                    General Giraud off the coast of France and nominate him to Command the French
                    forces. Well, through our clandestine radios with the French Underground, when
                    we got back to the headquarters, we contacted the people in France who were in
                    touch with General Giraud, and he agreed to come out. He had then escaped from
                    prison and he agreed to come out if we could assign an American submarine to
                    bring him out. I'm getting ahead of the story I guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, this is excellent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: But there wasn't an American submarine within six weeks of Southern
                    France, so that was quite impossible. So General Eisenhower arranged to use an
                    ill Jewell. The skipper of the submarine said “Those mines never go off anyhow
                    so let's just go in and take a chance.” We went in on the surface at nighttime,
                    went into the harbor and lay there for about two hours waiting for a response to
                    our identification signal that had been pre-arranged. Well, finally, we got the
                    signal that the general was on the beach waiting to come out, and he embarked in
                    a French fishing smack and came on aboard the submarine with himself, his son,
                    his chief of staff and his bodyguard — four of them. And we embarked in the
                    submarine in the harbor and the first thing he asked was who was I. And I said I
                    was an American naval officer in command of the submarine.He asked “What kind of
                    a submarine is this?”</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>“It's a French submarine, but I'm in command.” I emphasized. Well, that seemed to
                    satisfy the old boy so we shoved off. We departed from Isle de Fosquettes and
                    headed towards Gibraltar. When we got outside the harbor, we tried to report our
                    activities but the transformer that converts the electricity of the submarine to
                    a usable voltage that can be used on the radio had burned out so we had no way
                    of communicating with Gibraltar. Poor old Ike at Gibraltar and Cunningham wrote
                    us off the books as the unfortunate loss of one of their submarines. British and
                    mostly American (sic) and he'd been designated by the Prime Minister and the
                    President to command the operation, and he wasn't going to abdicate that command
                    to anybody not even a French general no matter who he was. Giraud insisted he
                    was French, they were landing on French soil and he a Frenchman must command. “I
                    have the plans for the operation here in my briefcase.” He had a briefcase
                    stuffed with papers. It became a question of the immovable object and the
                    irresistible force clashing in this Goddamned hole in a rock. It lasted just
                    long enough to be settled with the agreement that Giraud could command the
                    French forces and he, Eisenhower, would command all the rest. Well, the French
                    forces consisted of two broken-down airplanes; that was all the French had there
                    at Gibraltar. So he took command of those; that's all he had. So that's the end
                    of the story. We hung out on Gibraltar for about a day. A convoy was going
                    through the Straits at that time. Then later on, we flew in and landed in
                    Algiers on O-PIus-one following the landing. Eisenhower sent Clark and Julius
                    Holmes and me and, I think one other, I believe simultaneously with the landing
                    to go to Algiers. There we learned Darlan had been taken.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Admiral Darlan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes. Admiral Darlan. He was on an inspection trip of the French forces in
                    North Africa when we landed, and he had been caught on the shore of North
                    Africa. So he was the head mogul of all the French military forces everywhere in
                    all the world. In addition to admiral, he was Minister of Defense and had been
                    sent down to Africa to inspect the French military forces in North Africa to
                    ensure that they were prepared to resist any invasion that took place. And he
                    was down there to inspect the forces and arrange for the change of command and
                    so on.So we met with him. He was the arch-criminal in all of France, the one
                    most hated by all Americans because of his sympathies with Vichy and his command
                    of all of the French naval forces which are in resistance to us. The question
                    came of who would command, who would be responsible for the surrender of the
                    French forces. We demanded that he direct the surrender or the cease-fire of all
                    the French forces. (sic) Murphy and Clark and Darlan as to who would be the one
                    to administer the North African Government to head up the government and the
                    armed forces and the postage service and transportation and so on. Our candidate
                    was Giraud and the opposition's candidate was Darlan. Darlan had all the
                    ability.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Darlan had taken over.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Mark Clark and Murphy together agreed that Darlan had the skills and the
                    prestige and the ability to run the country. Giraud was a soldier and nothing
                    more. I was with Clark when he consulted with Giraud and said, “Who will you
                    have as your staff and your cabinet if we put you in command?”Giraud said, “I'll
                    use Darlan's staff and cabinet.” Well that didn't sit very good with either
                    Murphy or Clark. If you're going to use Darlan's staff and cabinet, the best
                    thing to do would be to put Darlan in charge, who had the leadership of the
                    staff and the cabinet that had the ability. So they did, and all hell busted
                    loose in England and America when this news broke that they had put Darlan in
                    command. But he never asked my advice on the subject with good reason.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you talk to the Chinese military, particularly the
                        naval men on Taiwan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Not on that subject because they were oriented toward Chiang Kai-shek,
                    and they weren't interested in talking to me about it' naturally. But we set up
                    a Joint Chinese-American committee to review the situation and discuss plans and
                    reach an opinion as to whether or not it was possible. I was actively involved
                    in that committee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your relations like with Chiang Kai-shek? Did
                        you have much to do with him or was he aloof?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: No. He was very agreeable and very conscious of his close ties with
                    Americans. Of course, his wife Madame Chiang Kai-shek, was practically an
                    American citizen. She was very influential with the old man and, I think,
                    advised him on all his relations with the United States. She was a powerful
                    influence in everything he said and did in connection with his relationship to
                    the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time that you were there, what was the relationship
                        of China to the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Which China?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm speaking of the Republic of China.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: They were very good. We had a very fine aid program of both military aid
                    and economic aid, and I had been there a year when it was apparent that they
                    would be self-sustaining economically. So we shut off all economic aid to them
                    and continued military aid principally in the field of technical equipment and
                    aircraft and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any difficulty in shutting off this other
                        aid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: No. They took it very agreeably. We said. “You're now capable of
                    sustaining yourself economically. You've got tremendous economic potential. It's
                    growing rapidly with the leadership you brought over from mainland China and we
                    think that you don't need this economic aid any longer.” So we shut it off at
                    the end of my first year there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How effective was Chiang Kai-shek's government? Obviously
                        it was effective economically but on the island of Taiwan was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: When he came over from mainland China, he brought with him a great many
                    skillful Chinese—doctors, engineers, industrialists, people that were the cream
                    of the crop of China as he knew it on China. So when he came, he brought all
                    those men with him and they were the men that headed up the activities of his
                    government. One of the men, the most influential, was Chen Chen. Chen Chen was
                    vice president. Chen Chen had the Job of setting up an agrarian program, a
                    program whereby the unilateral ownership of land would be distributed amongst
                    the Chinese, the Nationalists, themselves. And he did a very superior job. He
                    commandeered all the land, he allocated it to the Chinese proper owners and he
                    paid them for it by means of stock in the expanding industry. So the Chinese
                    landowners were very happy to get paid in stock in all the
                    industries—shipbuilding industry, electronic industry. All the industries had
                    rapidly risen. Nationalist China was largely owned by the men who had owned land
                    and who had been paid for shares in this industrial development and paid them
                    for their land. So they were very happy about it and the landowners were happy
                    about being compensated and it was a very agreeable and successful operation.
                    Many countries sent delegations to Taiwan to find out how it had been set up and
                    how it worked. Chen Chen was the vice president who did it. Unfortunately he
                    died in my second year as ambassador. But the program that he established has
                    continued.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had this worked well also with the native-born Taiwanese,
                        as opposed lo the Nationalist Chinese who came over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, the native-born Chinese were the owners of the land
                    principally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean the ones who were born in . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: The owners of the land benefitted by the tremendous increase in
                    development. Then, of course, the men who Chiang Kai-shek brought over were all
                    deeply involved in it. He brought over almost a million soldiers when they came
                    over. And they all participated in the government and the industry, labor and so
                    on. The whole country benefitted by the Awned—what do you call it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Reform, I guess you would call it. Land
                        redistribution.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes. The Awned redistribution programs. And there is some opposition, of
                    course, between the native Taiwanese who after all only Chinese had been sent
                    over here 200 or 300 years ago to populate the island, and they were the native
                    Taiwanese. The Japanese handled them like slaves. The Japanese, of course, did a
                    marvelous job in organizing the railroad and the shipbuilding industry and the
                    economics of the place but then they pulled out. As soon as they were defeated,
                    they pulled out, and the reins were taken over by these mainland entrepreneurs
                    that Chiang Kai-shek brought with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of instructions were you getting from Washington
                        at the time? Did you have any rather specific instructions other than keep
                        an eye on the invasion of what to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: There was only one crisis that developed, and the French were the
                    intermediaries in this matter. De Gaulle had become Prime Minister of France,
                    and he had tremendous respect for Chiang Kai-shek. He sent a general over to
                    Taiwan to call on Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, extended de Gaulle's very high
                    personal regard for the general emphasizing that the regard was for him only,
                    not for his government and not for his activities on the island. The inference
                    was clear that he didn't want to have any diplomatic relations with the
                    government although he did admire Chiang Kai-shek personally. Well, the question
                    came what to do about the Chinese representation in Paris. We in the United
                    States wanted to keep that Nationalist embassy going in Paris and it was obvious
                    in my mind that you couldn't keep an embassy going in Paris of a government of
                    which the head of the French Government was hostile. Somehow or other the
                    administration in Washington wanted to keep that embassy open and alive in
                    Paris, and I didn't think it was practical to do it to maintain a Nationalist
                    embassy there in opposition to the head of the French state. So there was kind
                    of an impasse there between me and the United States Government for awhile, and
                    they compromised by sending an emissary over who was a great friend of Chiang
                    Kai-shek to convince him to leave the embassy there. So he came over and
                    negotiated with Chiang Kai-shek, who agreed to keep the embassy there, but five
                    days after this fellow went back to Paris, he pulled the embassy out completely
                    and left a blank between France and Nationalist China. That's the only problem
                    that I had as ambassador. The rest of the time it was clear sailing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Coming from the Navy, how did you find the staff of the
                        embassy? Did it support you well? Or did you have problems with this? Was it
                        a different type of work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: No. I had no problems whatsoever. They were a fine bunch of level
                    fellows, and they all pulled together and were a great outfit. The diplomatic
                    representative and commercial fellow, political advisor, all of them were damn
                    good. They worked willingly with me and carried out all of my ideas as best they
                    could. We had the sympathetic consideration of the government. Of course, any
                    ambassador to a government which is a dictatorship and controls the press and
                    the labor unions, his job is pretty easy. So there wasn't any complications as
                    far as I was concerned. There were no anti-American riots — no nothing.
                    Everything was rosy. The press was sympathetic and everybody was fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you were ambassador, did you have much to do
                        with them? It was quite a strong political lobby at one point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: The political lobby was mostly against Chiang Kai-shek because he was a
                    dictator. You've got to face it — he came over and took charge and brought his
                    army with him and he ran the country. He was a dictator. He had a damn good
                    government; he did well with their economy. But they could have conquered
                    Formosa, Taiwan, easily if they had wanted to, but they didn't want to do it.
                    They didn't want to put the military effort into it, I suppose. Ad they felt
                    they could probably get themselves into control of the island by just some such
                    way as President Nixon suggested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By “mutual” agreement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes. And I think they're still working on it. They're just envious as
                    hell of the terrific success of the Nationalist economy. They've got everything
                    in there that we have given them and taught them how to do' that they know how
                    to do themselves. The Chinese are a very ambitious and able people. They took
                    the economy of that island and it's up now on a level with — nol quite the level
                    of Japan, but the same idea. The economy is booming in both technical and
                    commercial fields, and the Communists are jealous as hell and they want to get
                    their meat hooks on it. They're determined to do it, hell or high water. There's
                    been no evidence of it recently, I don't think, but the Chinese Communists are
                    desperately anxious to absorb Taiwan for that reason — due to their economy, due
                    to their technical activities and so on — and bring to Communist China the
                    technical skills that Taiwan has developed. When I was out there. I went down to
                    the center of the island and (sic) a bunch of mugs from British fabric. British
                    woolens. And I said “How come you're putting British Woolens in here when
                    they're all made in Taiwan?” “Oh,” they said, “that's the way our customers like
                    it.” And most of that wool in Hong Kong was used by Hong Kong tailors that make
                    suits for Americans! (Laughs)</p>

                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: That's a difficult question to answer. I had a very cordial relationship
                    with Chiang Kai-shek and the Madame and all of his government. A very friendly
                    relationship with all of them. There was mutual admiration, I think, for the
                    whole team. I left there with the feeling that I had a friend there, and they
                    appreciated my understanding of their problems. That's all I can say about it.
                    But I think I had a successful administration while I was there.</p>
