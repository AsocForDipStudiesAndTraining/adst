                <p>AMBASSADOR HERMAN W. NICKEL</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Willis Armstrong </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: August 31, 1989</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Herman Nickel was ambassador to South Africa from 1982 to
                        1986. Mr. Nickel, was this your first diplomatic assignment, so to speak?
                        Had you come out of another walk of life?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: It was. I've spent most of my professional life as a journalist; as a
                    foreign correspondent. I started as a foreign correspondent for Time magazine in
                    1958 and in the course of my career, had all kinds of foreign assignments,
                    including one in South Africa. The irony of my appointment was that my tenure as
                    Time correspondent in Africa, the seat in Johannesburg from 1961 to 1962, ended
                    with my expulsion by the South African Government after exactly one year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's an interesting turnabout. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: I don't think that this was their expectation of Ronald Reagan's nominee
                    for ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some time had elapsed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Yes. It was amusing that when I arrived in South Africa in April of 1982,
                    that very same afternoon the Foreign Minister, Pik Botha, asked me to come by
                    because I was going to present my credentials right the following day, and they
                    were in a great hurry to get me properly installed. And at the end of our
                    discussion, he said with a rather thin smile that, of course, the South African
                    Government remembered the circumstances of my departure from South Africa some
                    years ago, and he added with this touch of delicate Boer-humor, that they hoped
                    they wouldn't have to do this again. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's fair enough. [Laughter] Well, what did you feel as
                        you approached your assignment as ambassador to South Africa under the
                        circumstances of the year 1982? How did you feel in the context of your
                        previous experience in U.S. policy and all that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>NICKEL: South Africa is a kind of addictive problem. While I didn't follow South
                    African affairs in detail in the following years, it's a fascination that never
                    really quite leaves you. And I suppose it fascinates you because it is an
                    intractable problem. It takes place against a very beautiful backdrop, and so it
                    is a country that one fervently wishes could find a way for people to live at
                    peace with each other and with their neighbors.</p>
                <p>I had gone back to South Africa for the first time on a Fortune assignment in
                    1978 and got sort of “reinfected” with that South African bug. I felt very
                    strongly then that if we were going to play a significant and helpful role in
                    coming closer to this objective, that one had to give encouragement to those
                    forces in South African society on both sides of the racial divide that were
                    working to peaceful change. I say encouragement because it seemed to me that a
                    totally confrontational approach was not realistic. A confrontational approach
                    might be useful when you have the power to coerce other people into doing things
                    that they regard as being against their vital interests. And I do think that in
                    the case of South Africa, we lacked that kind of coercive leverage. Therefore
                    one had to reach out, especially to Afrikaners who, after all, controlled the
                    power of the state in South Africa. The challenge was working with them to
                    convince them that the continuation of the system of apartheid and the
                    continuation of a system in which Afrikaners tried to monopolize political power
                    was not in their own long-term interest, and that a new order had to be based on
                    negotiation with them and the consent of the black majority.</p>
                <p>And it seemed to me that the policy outlined by Chet Crocker in his well-known
                    Foreign Affairs article which he wrote before taking office, held out some
                    promise.</p>
                <p>I never had any illusion that we were anything more than a marginal influence.
                    But when the balance of forces in a society is fairly close, I think that once
                    in a while our influence can help to tip the scales. I think that is what I
                    wanted to accomplish: to use this influence in such a way that occasionally you
                    can help to give the forces of change—the good guys in this particular
                    situation—the kind of critical mass that moves things forward.</p>
                <p>I also was acutely aware of the fact that what drives the issue in the United
                    States is less the strategic importance of South Africa than our national
                    concern with the issue of race. I, myself, have doubts that South Africa rates
                    as a first-rank strategic problem for the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: World War I or World War II terms, yes. Future warfare,
                        less likely.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>NICKEL: That's right. I think that over the years the concern about the Cape
                    route, I think has receded considerably. And, while it is perfectly true that
                    South Africa has a vast store of strategic minerals which are very important to
                    the industrialized world, it is also true that any South African government
                    would have an interest in selling these minerals because you can't eat them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course. [Laughter]. You can't eat them and you've got
                        to eat, anyway, so you might as well sell them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: And the natural market for these minerals is, of course, the Western
                    world because the Soviet Union, which is the other major producer of many of
                    these minerals, has, you know, its own supplies, and in any case, does not
                    constitute that kind of a market.</p>
                <p>Our national interest is in not seeing a situation in South Africa develop that
                    becomes so de-stabilized that the very production of these minerals is put in
                    question. And, indeed, we have a significant national interest in stability, not
                    only in South Africa itself, but in the entire region. You can't separate
                    informal stability in South Africa from regional security. You can't have one
                    without the other.</p>
                <p>But it was clear to me, and indeed, that was always implicit and explicit in what
                    Chet Crocker outlined as his policy vision; that our interest in stability must
                    not be confused with commitment to the status quo, because the status quo in
                    Southern Africa had become patently unstable. And meant that the emergence of a
                    more stable order in Southern Africa hinged on peaceful change, especially
                    within South Africa itself, but also in better relations between South Africa
                    and her neighbors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a good overview of basic U.S. policy and I remember
                        working with Chet Crocker when he was at Georgetown, because I did some
                        teaching there when he was associate dean. I always admired Chet for the
                        clarity of his thought in regard to Africa and his policy since.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>You were there for four years. What would you say were the sort of peak events of
                    those four years? Were there any specific crisis and peak events that you felt
                    were important in terms of your trying to achieve your objective?</p>
                <p>NICKEL: Yes. I think there were several phases in my tenure.</p>
                <p>The first phase—roughly from 1982 to mid-'84—involved the constitutional changes
                    that P.W. Botha was trying to bring about and the constitutional referendum for
                    the establishment of the tricameral Legislature.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>And while in retrospect it is quite clear that the failure of that constitution
                    to make any provision for the participation of blacks in the central political
                    process was a crucial mistake, the problem was viewed by the government then as
                    one of how much the political traffic could bear among white voters. And P.W.
                    Botha, of course, was very much concerned at the time that he would not be able
                    to get the majority in a constitutional referendum from the white voters for any
                    constitutional provision that allowed blacks to come in, too. It was a
                    constitution which was bound to fail, but, it was a stage that created the
                    momentum for further change</p>
                <p>There were other changes that were important. In our contacts we were very much
                    concerned with key pieces of apartheid legislation like the Group Areas Act, the
                    old pass law system and so on. We spent a good deal of effort chipping away on
                    these pillars of apartheid.</p>
                <p>After the new constitution was adopted, our work moved into a different phase
                    because, as a response to the exclusion of blacks from the constitutional
                    dispensation—as the South African's call it—was the beginning of massive unrest,
                    and the repression that went with it. That began in mid-1984.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It had been fairly placid up 'til then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Up until that point it had been reasonably placid. I mean there was
                    always a dimension of protest and repression, obviously, but that dimension
                    became considerably greater. And the repression that set in began to out-crowd
                    news of any kind of reform process that was taking place. Indeed, the repression
                    seemed to negate any claims that reform was taking place at all.</p>
                <p>Now, that had an enormous effect on public opinion in this country and undermined
                    the credibility of the administration's contention that, indeed, there was a
                    reform process going on at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was hard to perceive.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Hard to perceive. Now, you may say that in a historical prospective, it
                    is very often that you have repression at a time when a good deal of change is
                    taking place because, indeed, I think it was de Tocqueville who, writing about
                    the origins of the French Revolution, pointed out that the revolt happens not
                    usually when the regime is at its most repressive but, quite the contrary, when
                    things seem to be in a process of change, when people then conclude that the
                    status quo is no longer something that they have to put up with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Russia in 1905.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>NICKEL: I hope we don't see the same thing happening in the Soviet Union now.
                    Well, there maybe some very grim alternatives for the Gorbachev government to
                    the Baltic countries and so on. So, indeed, there is no contradiction really in
                    a historical sense when repression does take place at times when change is in
                    the air. But in the public perception here, it completely negated the view of
                    the South African government as a regime that had set in motion a process of
                    change.</p>
                <p>The other aspect to our work in South Africa was diplomacy. I think that the most
                    important culmination of our efforts came, in fact, just before the unrest
                    started when in March 1984 we were able to witness the signing of the Nkomati
                    Accord between South Africa and Mozambique. I think that was a very signal
                    achievement and we had worked very hard on both sides, the Mozambicans and the
                    South African government to bring that about. I think the promise of the Nkomati
                    Accord of 1984 was delayed by the South African government's split personality.
                    Its attitude towards its relationship with its neighbors reflected the divisions
                    between the security establishment, which was very close to P.W. Botha, and
                    those diplomats who felt that better relations with the neighbors were one way
                    for South Africa to work its way out of the isolation into which apartheid had
                    put it. After the outbreak of unrest at home, the hawks were once again in the
                    ascendancy. P.W. Botha's counter-revolutionary instincts prevailed again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose the security forces were the ones who
                        stimulated, say, the opposition forces within Mozambique.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: That's right. I mean there was . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And other places.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: You know, there was convincing evidence that the supply relationship
                    between the South African military and the Renamo movement continued even after
                    the signing of the 1984 agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And does it still continue today, in your judgment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Of course, I have been out of government for three years by now. But, I
                    do believe that the “doves” in the South African government have finally
                    prevailed and that that kind of supply relationship has come to an end. That is
                    now attested by spokesman for the Mozambican government.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>I think that there's still a murky area of so-called private supply routes, you
                    know. There's a large Portuguese community in South Africa and there are still
                    some reports of some illicit traffic back and forth, but I think that even the
                    Mozambican government has finally accepted that the South African government is
                    no longer supporting Renamo as a matter of policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you see any hope for the Mozambican economy or society
                        as it seems to have been, you know, a very depressed, miserable area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But once very rich and comfortable.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: It is one of the tragedies that both Mozambique and Angola were—in terms
                    of natural endowments— among the most promising countries on the entire African
                    continent.</p>
                <p>Now that the Mozambican government itself has renounced some of the socialistic
                    experiments which aggravated their problems, the most crucial issue is the
                    restoration of internal peace. For so long as this destructive guerrilla war
                    continues, foreign aid is very difficult to administer effectively, foreign
                    capital stays away and the government itself can't get a handle on things. So I
                    think this depends crucially on creating peace and sometimes finding some kind
                    of political solution. I think the Mozambican government has come a long way in
                    accepting that there must be a political solution.</p>
                <p>There also is now a growing willingness to concede that what gave rise to the
                    emergence of Renamo was not solely the machinations first of the Rhodesian
                    Central Intelligence Organization or later of the South African security forces,
                    but some very fundamental mistakes that were made by the Mozambican government
                    in the earlier phases which led to quite an estrangement between the urban and
                    the rural populations. That is why Renamo was able to establish a base.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is characteristic and like Africa, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>NICKEL: That's right. And while I'm not talking as an expert on Mozambique, I
                    know that this is now acknowledged even by the Mozambican government. The other
                    day there were a group of Soviet African experts in Washington, including their
                    former deputy chief of mission in Maputo. When asked about the origins of
                    Renamo, instead of emphasizing the South African involvement and so on. He was,
                    in fact, putting his finger on that fundamental problem— Frelimo's mistakes in
                    the rural areas. And I think that that problem needs to be redressed and I think
                    that the fact that the Mozambican government does recognize this is a hopeful
                    development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that was the '84 event of particular importance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That started the move towards ending cross-border violence
                        and a reasonable relationship with Mozambique.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Unfortunately the better relationship was delayed by continued South
                    African violation of the Nkomati Agreement in letter and in spirit, but they're
                    now beginning to see the fruits of that kind of development.</p>
                <p>The other effort that we were spending a great deal of time on, obviously, was
                    the Namibian-Angola settlement. While I was not there when things finally came
                    to fruition, it was clear to us, even then, that it was only a matter of time
                    when all the parties to this dispute and I mean the MPLA government in Luanda,
                    UNITA, the Cubans, and, very importantly, the Soviet Union and South Africa,
                    were going to realize that a political settlement was preferable to an
                    indefinite continuation of that costly conflict. We had many ups and downs and
                    it took a long time to get all these unlikely parties to this negotiation with
                    the right constellation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A real congeries of characters, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: It was an extraordinary negotiation which cast, in the broker role, the
                    United States which had no diplomatic relations at all with Cuba, no diplomatic
                    relations with the MPLA, very difficult relations with the Soviet Union,
                    although that changed towards the end. The Soviet Union became very cooperative
                    in bringing about the settlement. And then, of course, we had to move along the
                    South African government, with which we had always had very difficult
                    relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Plus, then you throw in Mr. Savimbi and the SWAPO and
                        you've got other factors in the situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>NICKEL: Yes, although they were not directly part of the negotiations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were indirectly there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: But they were indirectly there. SWAPO, frankly, was not much of a player
                    in the diplomacy. But we could not ignore the concerns of Savimbi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who supports Savimbi?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Well, I think, first of all, you have to start . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were in and out, weren't we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Yes. But the first thing one must say is that Savimbi has a genuine
                    support base within Angola.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: And I think that that is the real key to his longevity, rather than the
                    foreign support he received— though it obviously was important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, they're not mercenaries.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: They're not mercenaries. I think they are in quite a different category
                    from Renamo, since Renamo was very much a creation at first of the Rhodesian
                    Intelligence Service, whereas UNITA was a genuine liberation movement. The South
                    Africans, of course, were very much concerned about the projection of Soviet
                    surrogates into the continent, because they were the only people who could
                    constitute a genuine military challenge to South Africa's military and strategic
                    preeminence of the continent. They saw support in Savimbi a way of fighting the
                    spread of Soviet influence into the region, and they spent a good deal of effort
                    and money in keeping Savimbi supplied. Savimbi accepted that because, for him,
                    it was, of course, a critical strategic link.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure. Sure. And he couldn't be too fussy about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>NICKEL: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there some European support for Savimbi also, isn't
                        there? French Intelligence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Yes. I think that they were certain sympathies on the part of the French
                    and perhaps on the part of the Belgians, too. I think that there was always some
                    support from within Africa, too. I mean there was a close relationship with the
                    Moroccans, between Savimbi and King Hassan. There were other Francophone
                    countries which did provide some support for Savimbi, including the Ivory Coast
                    and Gabon, which at least tacitly, were very helpful and, of course, very
                    critically, Mobutu.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. And, of course, that gave access to supply routes and
                        all that sort of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Getting the things into Savimbi that he needed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a fascinating process and it started really back
                        in '81-'82 as an objective of the U.S. Government to somehow get an end to
                        this ambivalent situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And do you feel that it's reasonably well on the way to
                        solution now, or that what's going on are a few hitches, but not . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Well, I think it was clear that an Angolan-Namibian settlement would not
                    go off without hitches. And, indeed, we had a big hitch right on the first day
                    when SWAPO, in an extraordinarily ill-considered move, violated the agreement by
                    the massive infiltration of SWAPO guerrillas. This left the United Nations with
                    little choice but to call on the South Africans to contain this incursion.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>I think that we are in for continued hiccups on this matter, but I have no doubt
                    that the overwhelming interest of all the parties in a peaceful resolution
                    or—let's put it less ambitiously—the prevention of a revival of this warfare are
                    going to prevail. I mean, all the parties have an interest in the settlement at
                    this stage and I think that when that strong motivation exists, it does become
                    possible to work out these hitches.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even with such an extraordinary array of contestants.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Yes. Perhaps I'm being too optimistic, but I think that the interest of
                    the parties, in the end, will see to it that these hitches can be worked
                    out.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Governments pursue their interests.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One should never forget it. To go on to the domestic side,
                        how do you see the situation is between South Africa and their puppet black

                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: The so-called independent homelands.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Whose independence, of course, is only recognized by South Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They're homeland, they're not independent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: The four that are nominally independent have only a sham kind of
                    independence. By now the independent homelands have really become something of
                    an embarrassment to the South African government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By now.</hi>

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>NICKEL: By now, because the whole preposterous notion that you could deal with
                    the problem of the political rights of blacks by relegating them to these
                    independent homelands became even more untenable. While they could live in this
                    sham independence and have their own political participation, their own
                    political institutions, they were, of course, totally dependent on the good
                    graces of the South African government. This was all knocked into a cocked hat
                    by the economic realities. Verwoerd had this crazy dream that by the mid-'80s,
                    the flow of blacks into the urban areas would be reversed and blacks would be
                    streaming instead into these independent homelands, which, of course, lacked the
                    resources and job opportunities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And where there was nothing to do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Where there was nothing to do, in spite of some terribly expensive and
                    ill-conceived schemes to create jobs and industries. It was a singularly futile
                    effort to make water run up hill. Having created these homelands, the South
                    African government now is in the awkward position of not being able to simply
                    abandon them and saying that this was all a sham independence anyway; you're no
                    longer independent . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're now back to square one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: You're back to square one. But by now you obviously have a considerable
                    number of blacks who are civil servants in those countries, people who have
                    built political power bases in these so-called countries and so on. All of which
                    makes it rather difficult to simply go back to square one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of like the District of Columbia, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Yes. What we saw during my years was the final discrediting of the grand
                    apartheid blueprint.</p>
                <p>

                <p>NICKEL: That's right. But while the old paradigm was discredited and lost all its
                    legitimacy—and this was acknowledged even by members of the South African
                    government of the National Party which, after all, embraced this scheme—the new
                    paradigm is much more difficult to find. The old paradigm is dead, but what is
                    the new one?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I suppose, at least, they've got some more
                        experienced blacks in administration and civil service now than they had
                        before, as a result of creating bureaucracies, because they had to create
                        bureaucracies in these places.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whether that simply leads to corruption is a . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: I think that, unfortunately, the quality the administration has built up
                    in these homelands is very much tainted by the fact that first of all, an awful
                    lot of black did not want to participate for reasons of principle, and
                    practically all of these homelands are rife with political corruption.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: This has become a considerable embarrassment, indeed, also a financial
                    drain for the South African government, which, in the end, must pick up the
                    bill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Has to pay for it. How do you feel about the African

                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Well, there was never any doubt in our mind that the African National
                    Congress still was seen by the great majority of blacks as the leading black
                    liberation movement.</p>
                <p>And that even though it was banned, in fact, many of the leaders of the
                    organizations that were allowed to exist legally—the United Democratic Front and
                    other organizations- -had strong ANC ties. So there was never any doubt in our
                    mind about the very strong political base of the ANC in South Africa. This is
                    not to say that the ANC is the sole, legitimate liberation movement. In the view
                    of Chet Crocker, it would have been a great mistake to act as if the ANC was the
                    only movement, because there's another very important strand of the African
                    liberation movements, you know, the black consciousness strain, which is
                    important and, indeed, you have the phenomenon of Gatsha Buthelezi and Inkatha
                    which has a very strong and very real base among especially rural or traditional
                    Zulus in Natal. You ignore these other groups at your peril.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember meeting Buthelezi in New York some years ago.
                        He was a very impressive person.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: He is, indeed. And it would be a great mistake to pretend that you can
                    make up an equation for South Africa that leaves him out. Nelson Mandela, I
                    think, to some extent, surprised and perhaps even slightly shocked the
                    commonwealth eminent persons group when he told them, very explicitly, that in
                    his view Gatsha Buthelezi had to be at the negotiating table. I say it surprised
                    some of them because they had come to believe the ANC propaganda that Buthelezi
                    was simply a puppet of the South African regime, which simply is not true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not true. No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Simply not true. And I think it's, by now, if you may have noticed that
                    even the ANC quite publicly now, is seeking some kind of a dialogue with
                    Inkatha. If they don't, there will be trouble. But to return to the subject of
                    the ANC, at the same time when, you know, while there were recurrent acts of
                    terrorism on the part of the ANC, and I use that term especially with respect to
                    bombing attacks which were quite indiscriminate, I find the word terrorism is
                    truly applicable when the bombs go off in hamburger stands or at bus stops or in
                    city streets. We had to take a principled position against that kind of
                    terrorism to lend credibility to any condemnation of violence by the
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were ANC operations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: They were ANC operations, but they were not very effective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they just killed people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: As a guerrilla operation the ANC was ineffective. The bombs they had set
                    off were morale raisers for the internal cadres of the ANC, to show that the
                    armed wing of the ANC still had a presence in South Africa. The effect on the
                    white-body politic was probably counterproductive. It appealed to the feeling of
                    insecurity on the part of whites. Fear is the driving political emotion of South
                    African whites, and by playing to that fear, it helped the right wing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>NICKEL: It strengthened the far right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That had tended to polarize—I mean, a lot of the
                        operations of ANC is intended to polarize the society even more.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: That's right. That's right. And I think that the ANC has undergone a
                    considerable theoretical transformation, because it used to say the struggle for
                    liberation will actually be won by military means, by liberation struggle in the
                    most literal sense of fighting. That was certainly the line of the South African
                    Communist Party, which, of course, has always had a formal and a very public
                    relation with the ANC I think what has happened in recent years is that the
                    argument has shifted to saying, “Yes, we have to negotiate. But if you want to
                    negotiate, you have to strengthen your own position by having a military
                    dimension to your struggle, as well.” That is now the basis for the ANC
                    defending the continuation of the armed struggle, for defending the continued
                    operations of the military branch of the ANC, Umkhonto we Sizwe, even as
                    negotiations begin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do the Russians supply the ANC—have they in the past— with
                        funds and other kinds of resources?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: There is a Russian connection with the ANC to this day, Gorbachev
                    notwithstanding. I think the Soviet Union has long seen its close relationship
                    with the ANC as a political asset. and it is not about to abandon that kind of
                    relationship altogether. I think it did supply the ANC with the wherewithal, the
                    limpet mines and so on, that were necessary for Umkhonto we Sizwe to carry out
                    some of these operations. In financial terms, that probably didn't amount to a
                    great deal, because I don't think that the quantity involved was all that great.
                    One could probably argue that some of the donations which the ANC has gotten
                    from some western, or certainly non-communist countries, like Scandinavia-
                    -were, in quantitative terms, at least, as important as the Soviet contribution.
                    You know, arms are readily available in the world, and if you have the money,
                    and if the money given to the ANC is not very closely controlled as to what it's
                    used for, one could well imagine that the ANC was able to use money from Western
                    sources to carry on these operations.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, South Africa is not necessarily entirely a poor

                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Yes. Some are, but you have vast differences. There's a generalization
                    the South African government likes to use that, our blacks are better off than
                    the blacks almost anywhere else in Africa . . .</p>

                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: But some of the poverty in the rural areas matches some of the worst
                    places in Africa. But there's no doubt that you have an emerging black middle
                    class in the urban centers. I think there is probably a broader base of
                    qualified, educated professional people than almost anywhere in Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the educational system in South Africa in terms
                        of education for blacks? How far can they go? How much do they have to pay
                        themselves, or does it get provided?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: First of all, I think you have to deal with the bitter legacy of the
                    apartheid-Bantu education madness.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Bantu education was conceived by Verwoerd quite openly as providing
                    inferior education that would just be enough to allow blacks to perform the
                    menial tasks that would be available to them under the apartheid system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Literate enough to take orders.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Literate enough to take orders, but not so literate as to raise
                    expectations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: And that, of course, had a disastrous effect. It became very clear that
                    with the economic growth that South Africa went through, especially the big boom
                    of the 1960s, that the greatest constraint to further economic growth was not so
                    much a lack of capital, but the lack of trained manpower. And there weren't
                    enough whites to go around.</p>
                <p>So industry had to take over where the state had fallen down on the job and do a
                    lot of training that normally would be done, in most countries, by the public
                    school system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>NICKEL: But the system is still laboring to overcome this criminal, deliberate
                    neglect of black education. So that even now, in per capita terms, the
                    government spends five times as much on a white student as it does on a black
                    student. You might say there are all kinds of reasons for it, because white
                    students tend to stay in school longer, you have a tremendous shortage of
                    qualified black teachers, etc. Most of the black teachers don't have high school
                    certificates, so they get less than qualified teachers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you can't do these things overnight.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Of course all these things take time, but what has happened is that with
                    the assistance of both public and private scholarship programs, the number of
                    black university graduates has—and attendance has—grown really dramatically in
                    the last few years. There are now more blacks graduating from high schools than
                    whites. Of course, you have had the breaking down of segregation at the
                    university level. Both the University of Witwatersrand, and the University of
                    Cape Town, the two largest and best white universities now have pretty open
                    enrollment so that you have something like 30% or more of the students at those
                    institutions being black. Now, the universities have gone out of their way to
                    provide the special bridging year to allow black students who enter these
                    universities to make up for the flaws in their secondary education, because
                    obviously, the secondary schools—black schools—are still palpably inferior to
                    them. The matriculation exams are now standard for blacks and whites, but there
                    are clearly shortcomings there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very interesting that there is a progressive
                        movement on in regard to black education. It has been for some time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's gaining momentum.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Yes. And the government is allowing at least the private schools to have
                    open admission policies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: But even somebody like De Klerk is still reluctant when it comes to
                    public education, because he is afraid of the political backlash, especially
                    from among the lower middle class and poor whites to any real public school
                    integration.</p>

                    did get to Zambia on a couple of occasions when we were there negotiating, but I
                    didn't get to Zimbabwe. However, my colleagues, who obviously had to deal with
                    the issue of South Africa all the time, and to explaining what our policy was,
                    came down to South Africa to spend some time.</p>

                    you're not a professional diplomat- -being a foreign correspondent comes about
                    as close to being in the Foreign Service as you can get. I think my staff
                    realized that I had a considerable amount of international experience. My first
                    foreign tour was in 1958 and I spent 20 years in Europe and in Asia and in
                    Africa and knew the world. Of course, as a foreign correspondent, you always
                    have a very close relationship to people in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: And they have a close relationship to people in the press corps.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly the American press corps.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: That's right. I think that there was a sense that, while they were not
                    getting a career Foreign Service Officer as Ambassador, that they had somebody
                    who had considerable foreign experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A career foreign experience officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: In fact, if I may say so, I probably had more foreign assignments and
                    more years abroad under my belt than most people in the embassy. And I had also
                    covered the Department of State and therefore knew the Washington end as
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: I had a very, very good and close relationship. I think the one thing
                    that I wanted to encourage in people was to speak their mind. One of the things
                    that you do—this is true in any organization—is that you always have to nudge
                    people to speak openly This was important to me since I did feel that I was new
                    to the diplomatic drill, so I was very keen to get the input of my political
                    counselor, political officers. If my instinctive reaction was to do this, I
                    wanted to know whether they had any reservations about that. I think that once I
                    made this clear, it was understood that I genuinely welcomed it. That it was not
                    just, sort of, a pro forma invitation to voice different views. I think we had a
                    very good and open relationship in the embassy. I think the fact that I came out
                    of journalism did have some effect on our reporting, too. As a journalist, one
                    does feel that one ought to get the story out, and that cables ought to be
                    written reasonably quickly after the event happens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Quality and quantity went up, I'm sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: I hope so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure they both did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: We got a reputation for being very quick in our reporting, and that
                    matters because if you want to make an impression back in Washington on what
                    particularly that means, if people have read it first in the New York Times or
                    the Washington Post or over the wire services, that is the first impression of
                    the event that they form, and that puts you behind the eight ball.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: I think it's very important, therefore, to come in fairly quickly before
                    people in Washington act on the basis of what they read in the press. I think
                    that's very important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the area of sanctions we put on—I've forgotten
                        the chronology—the Congress imposed certain sanctions, although Mr. Reagan
                        didn't like it very much. I've forgotten the dates, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Right. The sanctions campaign really picked up— and as I said earlier in
                    our conversation—after the outbreak of the unrest in the second half of 1984 and
                    the repression which followed in its wake. This built and built.</p>
                <p>In 1985, the President barely avoided the passage of congressional legislation by
                    the device of, in a way, preempting congressional action with an executive order
                    in September, 1985 In essence it codified some of the restrictions which we have
                    already practiced in economic dealings with South Africa; such things as
                    computer sales and things of that sort. The practice had already existed, but it
                    was codified through a presidential executive order which required the
                    declaration of a state of emergency under the law that would justify this kind
                    of action.</p>
                <p>But by 1986, it was clear the politicians on the South African issue had become
                    very much a main-stream issue in American politics and the politicians wanted a
                    chance to send their own message.</p>
                <p>There had always been segments of the Congress that had their own particular
                    interest in the South African issue—I'm talking particularly about the black
                    caucus, and about various liberal constituencies, like the churches. By 1986,
                    when you had Simon Legree-like scenes on television screens, night after night
                    after night, something had to be done to punish the villains. South Africa
                    became a morality play.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Practically every politician in the country felt that he had to address
                    himself to that problem and show his indignation. So, under those circumstances,
                    what do you do to show your indignation?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You pass a law.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>NICKEL: You pass a law. We have to give some tangible signal. Well, this was
                    supposed to be a signal to P.W. Botha as if he had somehow misunderstood that
                    Americans didn't care about apartheid. P.W. Botha didn't quite see it this way.
                    It was also meant as a message to the American constituencies that mattered to
                    these politicians.</p>
                <p>That led, in 1986, to the passage of the Comprehensive Anti- Apartheid Act of
                    1986, which imposed much stricter restrictions on economic dealings with South
                    Africa than had existed before, including a ban on any further investments, and
                    so on, the total stopping of all agricultural trade, and severe limits on other
                    trade.</p>
                <p>The Reagan Administration was an administration which was prepared to spend a
                    considerable amount of capital on the issue, probably more political capital
                    than any succeeding administration. My guess about the Bush Administration would
                    be that this readiness to spend political capital on the issue is much less.</p>
                <p>I think the opposition to sanctions was based on a number of considerations. One
                    is that the peaceful resolution of South Africa's very, very difficult problems
                    was much more easily achieved against the background of economic growth than
                    against a background of shrinking economic pie, in which whenever somebody else
                    is supposed to get something, it comes off your plate.</p>
                <p>I think that we have already seen some strengthening of the far right in white
                    politics. Among the poor whites, the fears of black economic competition, the
                    resentment of what they think that the blacks are now getting more of the pie
                    than they should, fear about jobs—I think that's all helping the far right in
                    white politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As we said earlier, poverty doesn't promote change.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: No. That, of course, is our own experience. It's hard to see the
                    emergence of the New South in the middle of the Great Depression. [Chuckle] It's
                    clear that the growing industrialization of the South helped put an end to Jim
                    Crow.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>There were also other considerations that the sanctions clearly made our
                    negotiations under Namibia much more difficult. It is now argued, in retrospect,
                    that the sanctions put pressure on the South African government to settle on
                    Namibia. But if you talk to Chet Crocker, he would agree that the total hiatus,
                    which followed the override of the president's veto on the imposition of
                    American sanctions, and our relations with the South Africans, may have cost us
                    a delay of about six months. There was a time when P.W. Botha's anger was such
                    that he, in fact, instructed people in his government not to deal with us. There
                    was an attempt at one stage, by P.W. Botha—ill-conceived and it didn't get
                    anywhere—to carry on the negotiations without participation of the United
                    States. To meet directly with the Angolans in Brazzaville. But, of course, the
                    Angolans were not so stupid as to go along with that, because they had no
                    particular interest in being left all alone with a big bad Boer at the
                    negotiating table all by themselves. Sanctions were a delaying factor, there's
                    no question in my mind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I'm sure it was. Were there times when you, as
                        ambassador, had difficulty having access to the people you needed to see in
                        the South African government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Well, let me say about our relations to the South African government that
                    they were always difficult. They were most difficult with P.W. Botha himself.
                    Because P.W. Botha was, as a personality, a choleric, somewhat paranoid,
                    bully-boy.</p>
                <p>I think it might be interesting, from a historical point of view, to recall my
                    first meeting with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. By all means.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: “Well, Mr. Ambassador,” he said, “we are glad to see you in South Africa
                    as the personal representative of President Reagan, and let me say that we have
                    great admiration for President Reagan. We certainly prefer President Reagan to
                    both his predecessor and to the man who ran against President Reagan, Fritz
                    Mondale.” (They had had experiences at a famous meeting in Vienna between Prime
                    Minister Voerst and Mondale.) “But, on the other hand, let me be quite blunt
                    with you. I really have no great confidence in the United States. I learned my
                    lesson in 1975 when you—you, the Americans encouraged us to go into Angola, and
                    then you pulled out the rug from under us and forced us to withdraw. Now I can
                    see your lips pursing, Mr. Ambassador, because you are about to tell me that
                    that was the Congress—The Clark Amendment. But let me say to you, it doesn't
                    really matter to me who does it, so long as it's your country. How do I know
                    that President Reagan, when he tells me now that he's against leading economic
                    warfare against my country, is going to prevail over the congress?”</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>Now, P.W. Botha was, in many ways, a very provincial Afrikaner politician who
                    didn't know very much about the rest of the world, and about how our political
                    system worked, but, in this respect, one must say that he was quite astute.Of
                    course, one could only say to him, “Please avoid doing things that make this
                    gloomy forecast inevitable.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: He was also very skeptical of constructive engagement.</p>
                <p>In that first encounter, I said “Tell me, what are you engaging in? Are you
                    telling me that you want to engage in the internal affairs of my country?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a hard question to answer. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Well, what one does say is that—I said, “We have a legitimate interest in
                    the stability of this country. We don't want to de-stabilize your country. Our
                    interest is stability in your country, but we cannot ignore things which
                    threaten that stability.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At least, in our judgment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: “In our judgment.” He didn't like the answer, but . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it was the only answer you could give.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Well, it was the only answer that one could give.</p>
                <p>The notion that P.W. Botha thought that constructive engagement was just manna
                    from heaven is absurdly wrong. He saw it as an anti- apartheid policy and a more
                    dangerous one than the previous one because it was more subtle, because it
                    appealed to those elements in South African society . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who wanted change.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Who wanted change and who saw, as one of the benefits of such change, a
                    better relationship with the United States of America.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Our concept of constructive engagement was never just an engagement of the
                    government. It was for the engagement of the whole spectrum of South African
                    opinion, especially, as I said, at the very outset of those elements who shared
                    our interest in peaceful change, a non-violent change, which meant
                    negotiation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have contact of any consequence with people like

                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: May I just continue on my answer . . .</p>

                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Inside the South African government, even though P.W. Botha had a very
                    oppressive effect on other members of his Cabinet—because he was a bully-boy and
                    they were all scared of him— there were considerable differences among various
                    ministers.</p>
                <p>I had developed, I think, what was a very constructive relationship with the
                    Minister of Justice, for example, Kobif Coetsee, with whom I had a long debate
                    on the concept, for example, of a Bill of Rights, which he initially rejected,
                    and the whole concept of an independent judiciary, which he—over the months of
                    our discussions—came to accept. And he was helpful on many things, on grievances
                    that we were trying to deal with.</p>
                <p>There were other ministers who were much less receptive, like Louis LaGrange was,
                    in fact, the Minister of Law and Order, as distinct from the minister of justice
                    . . .</p>

                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>There were other ministers, like Gerritt Viltoen, Minister of Education for some
                    of the time that I was there—he also was put in charge, for a while, of dealing
                    with the crisis in black education He was a man with whom one could take up
                    specific grievances and get some action. The same with the Minister of Labor.
                    But we were engaged on a very broad front with the government. Foreign Minister
                    Pik Botha, of course, is the man I dealt with more than anyone else— we saw each
                    other certainly almost every week once, because we had so many items on our
                    respective agendas, especially the regional items. Also, he became the conduit
                    for expressing some of our concerns about some of the internal developments. Pik
                    Botha saw himself, presented himself, as a so-called Verlichte, a reformer. Very
                    often made it quite plain that if he had his way, things would be done
                    differently from the way P.W. Botha was handling them. Pik Botha, however, was
                    given to histrionics. But, sometimes, you became so inured to it when he pushed
                    his chair away from the table and said, “Well, this is the end. We go our
                    way—you go your's. There's no point talking anymore,” and then you would head
                    for the exit, and he would tug on your sleeve and say, “Now, wait a minute. Wait
                    a minute. Let's get back here, and talk about it after all.” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>But there were some rather bizarre scenes, I must say, that we went through. In
                    the end, there was always sort of a glint of humor in his eye, and in mine,
                    too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I used to deal with George Brown in England. All
                        histrionics, you know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: That's right. I dealt with him as a journalist, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. I'm sure you know what I mean.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Yes. They also shared another quality, incidentally—Pik Botha and
                    Brown—they liked their drink occasionally. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. Your never quite sure whether Georgie was drunk
                        with his own verbosity or whether he was really drinking. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: That might be true with respect to Pik Botha, too, because he had a real
                    problem sometimes. How he could put away so much without actually dying from it,
                    I'll never know. But he could be quite coherent, in spite of enormous
                    consumption.</p>

                <p>Now, on the question of the embassy's contacts with blacks, let me say that there
                    was not only the effort made, but we also managed to keep the lines of
                    communication open. Much of the credit goes to my staff, of course. We were
                    always plugged in very, very well. And this in spite of the undoubted fact that
                    the policy of constructive engagement was not popular with South African blacks.
                    They tended to see the opposition to sanctions as a litmus test. If you weren't
                    for sanctions, you couldn't be all that much against apartheid. That's what many
                    of them thought, but by no means all. I'm talking about elites here, because
                    there's no question in my mind, and every single opinion survey has demonstrated
                    that when you get down to the rank- and-file who have to bear the consequences
                    of sanctions, unlike the elites who talk about it, sanctions are not necessarily
                    popular in the reality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Though they may be seen as a useful threat to use against the oppressive
                    South African regime when it comes to the implementation, a lot of blacks don't
                    really like it, especially when they discover that sanctions don't translate
                    into political progress all that easily.</p>
                <p>And this in spite of the fact that people like Desmond Tutu, for example, saw
                    support for sanctions as a kind of acid test—had made it into the acid
                    test—whether we were for apartheid or against apartheid. It was a difficult
                    relationship. I said, in spite of Tutu's very vitriolic attacks on President
                    Reagan's policies, I kept seeing Desmond Tutu, in fact, he received me for a
                    farewell call when I left in 1986, although his public stance said he wasn't
                    meeting with representatives of the Reagan Administration. Oddly enough, my
                    successor—for whom I have great respect—Ed Perkins, who is our first black
                    ambassador, was never...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I saw him on Thursdays.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: . . . was never received by Tutu.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Never. Really.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: I can't say that my sessions with Desmond Tutu were particularly
                    easy-going, although there was always a bit of good- natured banter back and
                    forth between us. I think that Desmond Tutu was very keen to demonstrate that
                    while he loathed the policy, he didn't have anything against me personally. I
                    think by way of demonstrating this, by sort of, letting me know that he thought
                    that, personally, I was a good guy, he, in fact, followed his own rule in the
                    breach and saw me repeatedly, many times. I think that's true.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>It's interesting, my farewell receptions, especially in Johannesburg, where most
                    of the black political elite live, there was an enormous spectrum of people from
                    the UDF, from Black Consciousness, from all kind of groups. From their public
                    rhetoric, you might have thought that they wouldn't show up at my farewell
                    party. They were all there and extremely cordial and I still have very cordial
                    relations with them. For they knew that if they came in to ask that we take up a
                    grievance—whether a forced removal, or a travel problem, or a case of police
                    abuse, we would take it up with the government and that as an embassy we had the
                    most clout.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: I have been back. I have been back three times, in fact. I will be going
                    back in connection with a study project which I will be doing for the U.S. Peace
                    Institute.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: It deals with the political implications of economic interdependence in
                    southern Africa . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very important study.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'll be interested to see how that goes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: I think economic interdependence is the proper description. It is not
                    just a dependence of the front-line states on South Africa, but it's a real
                    economic interdependence and, it provides political incentives for South Africa
                    as it does for the frontline states for political settlement. This is not to say
                    that you can simply ignore the continuation of apartheid. I think most black
                    political leaders find it very difficult to ignore the internal developments.
                    I've always felt that I think it was a very important element of the approach of
                    constructive engagement that success in negotiations between South Africa and
                    black neighbors had salutary effect on the political environment of South Africa
                    itself. It demonstrated that negotiation is possible, that it can produce
                    beneficial results. I think it has a clearly positive impact in what happens
                    internally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's definitely related to internal change, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Absolutely.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An opportunity for internal change.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because what you're talking about is growth instead of
                        stagnation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Right. Any kind of cross-border violence, I think, has polarizing effects
                    in South Africa itself, which make political accommodation more difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have a comment on the Anglos in South Africa as
                        against the Boers? They're a smaller element, aren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: It's about 60% Afrikaner and 40% English speakers in the white community,
                    that actually omits a rather sizable Portuguese minority and some other groups.
                    You know, there are Germans, but, basically, it's about a 60/40 split.</p>
                <p>Due to the legacy of the Boer war, and the emergence of the National Party as the
                    legitimate political expression of Afrikanerdom, most English speakers were
                    basically anti-government. But that has changed very drastically.</p>
                <p>Today the National Party has lost, perhaps, more than half of the Afrikaner
                    constituency. It has lost it in large part to the far right, to the Conservative
                    Party. And, indeed, it has lost a substantial number of better-educated
                    professional Afrikaners, who are more reform minded, to the New Democratic
                    Party. And the way in which the National Party has managed to survive is that it
                    now relies very heavily on the support of English-speaking voters, who see the
                    National Party as the safe party of reform.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a stable element.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: There is a central issue where there is little difference between the
                    average Afrikaner and the average English speaker. For even if the English
                    speaker presents himself as being more liberal, the notion of unfettered black
                    majority rule is as unpopular and as feared with English speakers as it is by
                    Afrikaners.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that depends on the color of your skin, not your
                        national origin. [Laughter] Perfectly natural act.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>NICKEL: This common element of fear, of course, is the greatest obstacle to
                    transfer of power, until whites come to recognize that there are safeguards for
                    them. That is, of course, incumbent on the other side to make clear that...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That there are.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: ...it's addressing those security fears.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: It's been said that the liberation of blacks leads through the minds of
                    whites, a sense on their past that democracy does not make them helpless
                    victims. One has to find come constitutional way, which is not just simply
                    race-based, to address these fears of whites before the transfer of power is
                    really going to take place. There have to be checks and balances and protections
                    for individual rights, and unless that is done in a convincing manner, both
                    English speakers and African speakers are going to resist the transfer of power
                    and will continue to see it as a kind of political suicide. That also applies to
                    other minorities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there any significant Marxist influence among the black
                        people apart from—I know ANC has to some extent that, but how about
                        others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Well, you get a lot of Marxist rhetoric in the statements of liberation
                    movements, because the liberation struggle has been defined, not just as a
                    struggle against white minority rule, but also the struggle against capitalist
                    exploitation. Rightly or wrongly—wrongly in my view—capitalism has been
                    presented as the other side of the apartheid coin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, most of the business owners are white, I
                        suppose.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: That's right. There is this notion that apartheid is really the ultimate
                    form of capitalist exploitation.</p>
                <p>There was a time—there's no question—when the mining industry in South Africa
                    benefited from cheap labor. I think now, not only is the nature of the structure
                    of the South African economy such that mining has relatively receded in
                    importance, but the industrial sector has become more important than the mining
                    sector. The nature of the mining industry is also changing. It's no longer as
                    labor- intensive an industry as it used to be.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>But that notion of the unholy alliance of capitalism and apartheid is a very,
                    very strong one. Since one is reacting against the present system, the result is
                    a kind of Marxist rhetoric that you no longer even hear in the Soviet Union
                    these days. It is a funny thing that the last outpost of this kind of talk in
                    the world seems to be Southern Africa. I think one has to separate between
                    what's simply rhetoric and what is in the minds of these people that form the
                    economic future.</p>
                <p>I think one has to say that until now, the ANC has really thought very little
                    about coherent economic blueprints for the future, and to the extent that they
                    have now been forced by various useful dialogues that have taken place, to
                    define what they really mean, they have become considerably more moderate.
                    They're now talking more about the mixed economy. But, of course, they're still
                    talking a great deal about redistribution of wealth. And they're talking in
                    terms of nationalizing the commanding heights of the economy than the kind of
                    wholesale socialism that they seemed to be endorsing some years ago. That may be
                    the result of the collapse of their old socialist role model.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's beginning to sound something like the British Labor
                        Party.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: It seems to be moving in that direction. It's still, in my view, rather
                    half-baked, because there has been a tendency on the part of the ANC to say,
                    “Well, we'll think about that when we come into power, but the first thing is to
                    win the struggle of liberation, then we'll get down to these economic problems.”
                    And that, of course, is going to be a tremendous challenge for the future,
                    because South Africa does face a kind of Malthusian nightmare, with an exploding
                    population and very little prospect of generating enough jobs to absorb this
                    additional population.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Has the effect of sanctions, shall we say, increased self-
                        sufficiency in manufacturing, or haven't the sanctions had enough bite to

                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: I think that the South African government has always anticipated
                    sanctions, and in various areas, and, of course, was very keen to build up that
                    autarky even before the sanctions were actually imposed.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>The example that is most frequently cited, of course, is the arms industry. South
                    Africa, perhaps as a result of the sanctions, has become the major arms exporter
                    these days, which is a matter of necessity, because, otherwise, the unit cost of
                    these items that they do produce would be even greater than they are now. I
                    think the biggest damage that sanctions have done is basically to dry off the
                    capital inflow. South African businessmen have, in some respects, profited over
                    the short run from their ability to buy up multi- national companies at
                    fire-sale prices. They've made some tremendous bargains in this respect. But the
                    trouble is that the simple acquisition of these manufacturing facilities, and so
                    on, has not added new jobs, hasn't really been, in that sense, new
                    investment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like a takeover.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: That is like a takeover and it simply doesn't create jobs the way the
                    South African economy needs to create jobs. That is, I think, the biggest single
                    damage that sanctions has inflicted on the South African economy.</p>
                <p>There's clearly also a technology loss that has occurred through the severing of
                    these ties with multi-national companies. It's not that the technology becomes
                    unavailable, but it does become available at a higher cost.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It doesn't flow naturally because of the corporate
                        relationship.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There has to be a separate process in acquisition.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Right. Right. And that is damaging. I think the actual trade sanctions,
                    so far, have not really been all that crucial in their impact. For example that
                    South African coal continue to be exported, whether it goes through Taiwan. It's
                    a tangible commodity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the world is a big market.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: This is almost impossible to track down and South Africans have developed
                    some very important new markets, since the sanctions. Mainly in the Pacific Rim
                    in Southeast Asia. Taiwan has turned out to be a very important economic
                    lifeline to them. They've had very close relations with Taiwan throughout—when
                    Taiwan was still in that position of being another one of those pariah states.
                    They've developed a very close relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's not a bad connection. Taiwan's a very
                        efficient operation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember when I was Assistant Secretary for Economic
                        Affairs, when the energy crisis hit us in '83, the South African ambassador
                        came to see me to tell me that—in case we were having trouble with our
                        energy supplies—we had a lot of coal—that they developed some pretty good
                        techniques for extracting a lot of coal, maybe we could do some business. So
                        I said, “We'd bury the mine.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, it's highly expensive, but it does work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: I mean, on the whole question of self- sufficiency, in energy, first of
                    all when there's been an oil glut, it's almost impossible to impose any kind of
                    . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is totally irrelevant now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: . . . oil embargo. Secondly, they did spend a good deal of money in
                    improving on the German World War II process— the Leuna process. It's still more
                    expensive, but they built up the synfuel capacities to about one-third of their
                    needs. They also sit on a considerable reserve of crude oil. They've been
                    selling some of it off now, because obviously when you sit on oil you've bought
                    at high prices, it becomes a very expensive business to just have it sit there.
                    Actually, they've been selling off oil in the world market, some of their
                    reserves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With an oil glut, you can always buy oil somewhere.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you don't need to stockpile it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is, of course, why we haven't filled our own
                        reserves.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>NICKEL: Yes. You know, you're dealing with a country that has an enormous wealth
                    in coal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: And in Mossel Bay there are some reasonably promising oil and
                    gas-drilling operations going on. So long as oil prices are low, they may not be
                    economical, but the South Africans figure that might change again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They have experimented some with nuclear power, haven't
                        they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Not just experimented. They have a nuclear power plant at Koeberg, which
                    is outside Cape Town, which has been operational for quite a few years.
                    Basically Westinghouse-designed reactors, supplied by the French and serviced by
                    the French. The one explosion, an attempt at sabotage at the Koeberg Nuclear
                    Power Station, evidently was done with the help of a French communist who had
                    gotten into the plant as one of the technicians there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have you got a comment on the Israeli relationship with
                        the South Africans? People talk about it a great deal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: They talk about it a great deal, and of course, its hard to get at all
                    the facts, because they're being kept very, very closely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's not the information that the Israelis share with
                        us.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: No. Obviously, there's quite a number of Israeli nuclear physicists and
                    other technical people, and vice versa, South African scientists who have gone
                    to Israel. I'm sure there has been a good deal of cooperation on the technical
                    side. It's a very sore subject with the Israelis, as you know. It's not such a
                    sore subject with the South Africans who like to emphasize the parallels in the
                    situations, you know, with two beleaguered nations, both of which have in common
                    that they are afraid of being swamped by those hoards that surround them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One thing they don't have in common is the U.S. policy
                        towards them.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>NICKEL: There's a big difference in policy, yes. I often wondered what kind of
                    leverage one would have if one had that kind of aid program in South Africa.
                    But, as we know, sometimes our leverage with the Israelis, in spite of the
                    enormous aid relationship that we have with them, also seems to be quite
                    limited.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's so big, we don't have any leverage.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's not crucial or vital; it's the main show.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: It's the opposite end of the spectrum, but sometimes the opposite ends of
                    the spectrum seem to converge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's fascinating. Well, this has been very interesting
                        and I think we're coming towards the end of the tape. But I wondered, have
                        you got any other final comments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: What made this kind of ambassadorship so interesting—some may say
                    difficult—is that you're dealing with a foreign policy problem which deals with
                    the domestic policies of the host country and is driven in this country by
                    domestic politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: You cannot construct a sustainable foreign policy unless you have some
                    kind of domestic consensus and support. On this issue when many politicians on
                    the Hill, quite naturally—it's in the nature of elected officials—to cast their
                    policies in terms that will appeal to them or will meet their domestic political
                    needs. But what is needed from the point of view of domestic politics and what
                    is needed in terms of foreign policy is sometimes very difficult to
                    reconcile.</p>
                <p>I think you do have a tremendous need for presidential leadership. I must say
                    that I admire Ronald Reagan's willingness to stick with the issue, both on the
                    sanctions issue and sticking with the negotiating track that we had worked out
                    in Namibia and Angola, and his willingness to spend political capital on the
                    issue. But I must say that had he been better able to communicate real empathy
                    and concern with the whole question of racial injustice, not just in the South
                    African context, it would have made our job a bit easier.</p>

                    <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He didn't do that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: He was not a great communicator on the issue, because he didn't seem to
                    feel it quite as urgently as perhaps other Americans do. Had he been able to
                    communicate such a sense of urgency, I think his ability to sustain his policy
                    would have been much greater.</p>
