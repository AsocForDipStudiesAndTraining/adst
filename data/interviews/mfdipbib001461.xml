                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Tape 1 Side 1 of an interview with Ambassador
                        Robert S. Strauss. This is being done on behalf of the Association for
                        Diplomatic Studies and Training, and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. Mr.
                        Ambassador, can we start at the beginning? When and where were you born, and
                        can you tell me a little about your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: My mother was from Hempstead, Texas. Her father came to Hempstead,
                    shortly after the Civil War. Her grandfather, who would be my great grandfather,
                    was the first Reform rabbi in Texas. He came about 1862, -3, -4, -5. Civil War
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it the family originates in Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Germany, yes. My father was a German immigrant. He came to this country
                    at the age of about 20 or 21. He had been educated in France. I think his father
                    had died and his mother had remarried, and I don't think he had much use for
                    having her children around there, and they put him in a private school in
                    Switzerland. They could afford to; apparently they were people of some
                    substance. So he came to this country at the age of about 20. He was a musician.
                    He met my mother in south Texas, where she lived. Her family then moved from
                    Hempstead to Lockhart, Texas, where her father had a little store. As many of
                    the immigrant families did, they'd go to these little small towns. They went to
                    Lockhart, and that's where my mother grew up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lockhart is where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Lockhart is about 25 miles south of Austin, Texas. I remember going
                    there frequently enough to have a recollection of the house where I was
                    born.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were born when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: In October 1918, so I will celebrate my 84th birthday this month.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Congratulations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: And I still work five days a week pretty hard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm glad I'm taping you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: You may not have many more years to do it. I don't think I'll make over
                    10 or 15 more years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your mother's family actually were shopkeepers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your father was a musician?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: A musician and a salesman. He was selling pianos when he met my mother
                    traveling in south Texas out of San Antonio. I don't think he lived in San
                    Antonio; he'd center when he traveled to sell his pianos in that part of the
                    country. He'd stay in San Antonio and go to these little towns.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the era when every respectable person wanted to
                        have an upright piano in the parlor whether they played it or not.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Everybody wanted one, exactly. And my father, he loved pianos. I guess
                    my grandfather probably helped him and my mother start a little store of their
                    own. He wanted to quit traveling, and she wanted him to because they had just
                    married and they wanted to settle down. They moved to west Texas then, to a
                    little town called Hamlin and later to a town called Stamford, Texas, which is
                    where I grew up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where? I'm not a Texan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: These are in west Texas out near Abilene, Texas.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You grew up there? How old were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: It's Stamford, a town of about 3500 people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the principal occupation in that area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Farming, cattle and cotton.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were your family running a store then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: They ran a little store then, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh, yes, I would work after school sometimes, but most of the times I
                    didn't. I was out playing. My parents were not much in the way of taskmasters,
                    and my mother was scared to death I would spend too much time around that store
                    and end up at the store. She wanted me to be a lawyer. One time when I was 10 or
                    12 years old she told her family that Bobby is going to be a lawyer and he is
                    going to be a diplomat and he's going to be the first Jewish governor of the
                    state of Texas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: As a matter of fact, I had a couple of opportunities to run for governor
                    after that, but I didn't have any desire to be governor, and may or may not have
                    been successful. But it was sort of a standing joke among my relatives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your mother had the right idea.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: She had the right idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How old were you when you moved to Stamford?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I was ready to start the fifth grade.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it like growing up in the town?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: It was a nice life. Doors were open; no one ever locked a door. My
                    brother and myself, my father and mother: there was nothing particularly
                    different about us than the other families in town, I guess. People ask me what
                    it was like being Jewish, and I say, well, I really had no Jewish background,
                    except my mother insisted that we know we were Jewish and have some respect for
                    our faith and a feel for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No Bar Mitzvah?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: No, no, I couldn't spell it. I couldn't spell it when I got through high
                    school, much less then. But my mother convinced me that I was one of God's
                    chosen people as a Jew, and I can remember being kind of embarrassed walking
                    around town realizing I was one of God's chosen people, and I couldn't say
                    anything about it. Instead of feeling a sense of inferiority, I rather had a
                    sense of superiority and kind of hated the fact that I couldn't mention it, it
                    would be in poor taste.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your mother sounds like a very powerful woman.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: She was a very powerful influence on me and on my brother.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did your brother do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: My brother was a successful businessman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about school? How did school grab you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, I was never a student, and my mother didn't encourage me to be a
                    student. It used to drive my father crazy when she used to say, “Don't study too
                    hard, Bobby.” My dad would say, “You know he isn't studying too hard. He doesn't
                    study a damn bit. That's the most idiotic thing, Edith. Why do you keep telling
                    him not to study too hard?” She said, “Well, it gives him ulcers, and it'll
                    upset his stomach. What you need to do,” she'd say, “is just learn to live with
                    people and like people.” And I swear to goodness that I think that that had an
                    impact on my ability. I've always liked people and they've always liked me, and
                    I've never been a successful student of anything except people and what
                    motivates people.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your career shows this. When the going get tough and they
                        need a nice guy to go in and take care of things, you're the guy they
                        send.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Frequently! It's very interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So your mother had the right idea. Did she feed you a lot
                        of chicken soup?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: She fed me very well. She was a hell of a cook and she also ran the
                    store. My father was not a businessman. She was the businesswoman of the
                    family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any music in your background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: None whatsoever, and it drove my father crazy. He must have brought home
                    every musical instrument at one time or another for us to try, and nothing took.
                    He'd pick up that damn saxophone - he'd never seen one, I guess, or never held
                    it - and he'd fool around and could make music with it, but not me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know there's school learning and what you really
                        learn, you know, reading and all that. How about reading?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I was a voracious reader. I guess I was until I became Chairman of the
                    Democratic Party, which changed a lot of things for me in a lot of ways both
                    positive and negative. I haven't had any extra time since then. If you look at
                    my career, every so often I changed the dimension of my career dramatically and
                    I'd find myself in a job I'm ill prepared for and have to get up and start
                    reading at 5:30 in the morning to be able to attend the meetings and be informed
                    enough to hold the meetings at 8:30. I still read a lot; I read four or five
                    newspapers a day, but once you read the New York Times you can read the other
                    three or four pretty quickly. And I'm reading Caro's book now on Lyndon Johnson
                    and I just finished David Rockefeller's book.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, Master of the Senate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, that's what I'm reading now. I've read the others. I don't like him
                    very much, but he surely can write. I've never met him and if I did, I'd
                    probably end up liking him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He really didn't like Johnson.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: He didn't like him at all. I kind of skimmed through the first two.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I must say, I read the first, but then he got me so
                        annoyed. With all his faults, Johnson is a powerful and very positive
                        figure, I think, in the American political scene. He got things done. And
                        the idea of somebody just not liking him as a person and writing a
                        biography, I think, doesn't come out very well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: This fellow made up his mind, it seemed to me - Caro did - that by the
                    time Johnson was 12 or 13 he had no character, and he set about in three books
                    to prove that he had no character.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Robert Caro, C A R O, who's written some books on
                        Johnson. Now, was there a library in Stamford?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh, yes, there was a Carnegie Library.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: He's a god to me. When I think of the people who had access to real
                    books in that dusty little town of Stamford, which is so poor, but they had a
                    Carnegie Library and it was just simply wonderful. My only problem was I would
                    sometimes forget to turn in a book, and then the fines would get bigger and
                    bigger and then I'd be tormented on what to do about it as a kid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any particular kind of reading that you did? Did
                        you do the usual Tom Swift...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: All that stuff, yes, and Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn and Tom Swift. I guess
                    that's what I got out of the library, that sort of books then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In school while you were in Stamford do you recall any
                        teachers that particularly stick in your mind or were influential on
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: No, I really don't. They were nice people, and I thought they were
                    adequate as teachers. I was never much of a student, and I always did just
                    enough work to get by. As I said, it pleased my mother and displeased my father.
                    He had no patience with me.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about as a kid playing around? We're sitting here in
                        an office with a picture showing you at a very early age with your .22
                        rifles. What were the sort of kid things you were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, I did the things kids do. We built scooters with little wheels
                    taken off of our skates...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Orange crate for the...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: ...yes, that sort of thing, yes. We built wagons that way. When I was
                    about eight or 10 I had my first BB gun, and we hunted birds with BBs but rarely
                    hit one. When I was a little older I had a .22 and we'd go out and shoot cans
                    and try to shoot rabbits but rarely hit. And we got into the kind of trouble
                    kids get into. My mother used to take the position with my father that I was
                    just a wonderful, perfect youngster but sometimes I had a tendency to run with
                    the wrong boys, and it was their fault, anything that I was involved in - never
                    mind. And I was happy to go along with that. My father was hard to persuade, but
                    he wasn't much of a taskmaster either and my mother really ran the family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the mix of Stamford? Was there a
                        Mexican...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: There were a few Mexicans and a few blacks, a number of Mexicans and
                    blacks. In the fall the Mexican cotton pickers would come in and harvest their
                    crops. They had to start in one part of south Texas and they'd work their way
                    up, where things came to bloom later, in central Texas where I lived and west
                    Texas. In cotton season they'd pick the cotton - they pull cotton bolls, not
                    pick cotton, which is a different thing - because they had short staple cotton
                    out there, you'd pull those bolls.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like you'd cut your finger.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, and they would pay you. They paid, I think, 25 cents a
                    hundred-weight for your bolls if you pulled them, and that was without the
                    cotton pulled out of the boll. The whole boll would be there and it would be a
                    big part of the weight - I remember that. But things were very poor. Cotton was
                    eight or 10 cents a pound less.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you were around 11 or so, the Depression
                        started. How did the Depression affect you and the town of Stamford?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Just before we moved to Stamford, my mother persuaded my father that the
                    family should go to Europe, because her father and mother wanted to go back and
                    visit some of the places they were from. So my father and mother, my four- or
                    five-year-old brother, and I, the six of us, took this trip to Germany and other
                    places. I think the trip cost my father $3,000 for our share, for the whole
                    thing. I don't know why I have that notion it was $3,000; I've always had it in
                    my mind, because they must have said so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it sounds logical.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: But when they came back after being gone six weeks visiting relatives
                    and other places, things really were bad, and my father and mother never really
                    recovered financially from that trip. My dad used to say, which irritated me and
                    my mother, “If I hadn't taken that goddamn trip, if your father and mother
                    hadn't insisted on it, we wouldn't have spent that money and we wouldn't have
                    closed our store.” They just locked the damn store; they just closed the door
                    for three months. They never recovered from that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall where in Germany or did you ever hear
                        where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I know we went to Brussels Island and I know we went to Durenfurth and
                    other places, Berlin, but I don't recall. I was just too young to pay that much
                    attention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was part of the Hitler time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Earlier, in the early thirties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The real Depression started to hit in the 1930s. By that
                        time you were just getting close to high school time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, I finished high school and entered the University of Texas at the
                    age of 16. I was going to be 17 the next month. I enrolled in September. Some of
                    my family before me, an uncle and aunt had attended the University of Texas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were relatively close to Austin.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes. As I grew up it had never occurred to me that I'd have any interest
                    in going east to school. I wasn't even impressed by it. No one in my circle, the
                    people I knew, no one out of west Texas went to Harvard or Yale, to my
                    knowledge. So going to the University of Texas to me was the ultimate. It never
                    occurred to me to go anywhere else. I was probably the only person in my class
                    that went to college - that didn't go to business school or go to one of the
                    little, small colleges in Abilene, Texas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of like a teacher's school or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Abilene Christian College and Hardin Simmons' a Baptist School. But I
                    went to the University of Texas, and I was the exception, I think the only
                    person in my class that did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the high school like? It must have been rather
                        small.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, it was small. I don't remember what my graduating class looked
                    like, but I suspect 50 people probably were seniors when I was. I did a little
                    of everything in school except I wasn't very good in sports, but I tried them
                    all. I was not an athlete, and it just crushed me. I wanted to be. But I was
                    popular and I was happy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Often in high school the political bug bites people. Did
                        you run for office and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes. As a matter of fact, the summer before I went to college, I helped
                    a fellow my dad knew - his name Travis B. Dean - who was running for the
                    legislature in Stamford, Texas. I handed out a few cards for him and circulars
                    for him. Mr. Dean told me, “When I get elected, Bobby, and you go to Austin,
                    I'll help you get a job. I know you need one. I'll help you get one in the
                    Capital! I'll have some patronage.” Sure enough, he got elected, and he had $120
                    a month for the patronage and he gave me a third of that patronage. He gave me a
                    committee clerk's job. Didn't have to do much of any work; it was just almost
                    pure handout. But it helped me for two or three years. It was enough, and with
                    the $10, $15 or $20 of checks I'd write monthly on my family account, I lived
                    like a king.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the Depression in Texas at that time, money went a
                        long, long way.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh, yes, I lived like a king. An older friend of mine, a fellow that I
                    had known, went to the University of Texas and belonged to a very nice
                    fraternity and was socially well placed - people talk about joining fraternities
                    - and I thought, well, when I go to school I'll join this same fraternity Tom
                    Buckley belongs to. I had a cousin who told me, “You've got another thought
                    coming” - she went to the University of Texas - “because the only fraternity
                    open to you will be a Jewish fraternity.” I thought she was crazy, but I got
                    there and I found out she was dead right in that the Jewish students had a
                    couple fraternities and one sorority and that's where you went if you wanted
                    one. So I joined one, but it offended me terribly. I found that the Jewish
                    students primarily ran with each other and didn't broaden their acquaintance,
                    which was just contrary to the kind of life I'd lived. I found it a traumatic
                    experience, very traumatic. The fellows in my fraternity were very hesitant to
                    ask non-Jewish girls for a date, and I took a dim view of that. But in a year or
                    two I worked myself out of that because I got interested in other activities and
                    other things at school and before long I had a broader acquaintance than most of
                    my friends did at the fraternity, which I enjoyed. I made a lot of good friends
                    in that Jewish fraternity, have never regretted it at all, but the process that
                    delivered me there offended me then and still does..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What years were you at University of Texas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: From 1935 through 1941. I graduated with a law degree in 1941.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back, what was the impression of the education you

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: To tell you the truth - it's kind of embarrassing, but I've told my
                    children and grandchildren the truth, so I might as well tell you - I did just
                    enough work to get by.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got what is known as a gentleman's C.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, that was me. I didn't fail courses, but I don't remember ever
                    making very many As and Bs. When I got to law school, I didn't have enough sense
                    then or the judgment to study hard and I again did just what I needed to do to
                    get by and graduate on time. I never failed a course, but I was in the bottom
                    quartile of my class, I can tell you that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the University, were there any activities...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: The University of Texas was a very important part of my life - and still
                    is, I might add - with various activities and honorary societies. Again, I was
                    popular. I liked a lot of people there and they liked me. I met John Connolly,
                    who came to play a very important role in my life, there. He was the most
                    attractive fellow on the University of Texas campus probably. He and I developed
                    a pretty good friendship, which later became a very important friendship for me
                    and for him. I met my wife, who had had two years at Wellesley, when she
                    transferred to Texas, met her there the first day she was in Austin, and I have
                    been with her ever since, and it's almost 70 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was her background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: She came from a well placed Jewish family in Dallas, and she went east
                    to school at Wellesley and lived two years in Boston. It was too far from home
                    and it was cold and she decided she wanted to go to school back at the
                    University of Texas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your mother had been pushing law. How did you feel about
                        law?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: It appealed to me; strangely it appealed to me, I guess, because it
                    seemed to me that with a law degree you could to do anything you wanted to do.
                    And that has proved to be the case. I have a law firm here that I started myself
                    with a fellow named Dick Gump, who retired quite some years ago. We started out
                    in Dallas with a clientele of $50 divorce cases and collection matters and, as I
                    used to laughingly say, several smaller items. Now we have been 900 and 1,000
                    lawyers scattered all around the world. I have been extremely successful, a
                    productive lawyer. We just had an important article in a publication called
                    Corporate Board Member: they took a poll of about 3,000 corporate executives,
                    directors and executives of law firms, and this firm I started in Dallas, Texas,
                    in 1945 right after the war - October 1945 - was picked as the 11th or 12th best
                    law firm in the United States. I tell you that with a great deal of pride. I
                    have a hard time being properly humble about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think a little pride is necessary. With Texas law, was
                        there a different cast, would you say, to it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: As a matter of fact, Charles, there's sort of a theory down there that
                    if you're going to practice law in Texas, you're a hell of a lot better off
                    going to the University of Texas because the 100 or so people in your class
                    would be the 100 or so lawyers that you will be practicing with, among others,
                    the rest of your life. Some of them will be in south Texas, others will be in
                    Amarillo or the Panhandle, and another will be in El Paso and on and on, and you
                    would each know each other and you'd help each other. It turned out to have some

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: It didn't occur to me, frankly, that they were getting a very superior
                    education at Harvard and Yale, but what I was looking for was available for me
                    right there. I knew more people on the University of Texas campus probably than
                    most other students did and probably would have run well in some sort of
                    popularity contest. My father left us no financial inheritance, but he left my
                    brother and me his personality. My father always was a popular man and I had an
                    appealing personality as a young man and a respectful one for my elders. Older
                    people liked me and my contemporaries liked me, and I liked all of them, I liked
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It strikes me that there are almost two types of lawyers -
                        sometimes you can combine both - one, the ones who really know the law and
                        are well educated - I won't call them bean counters, but they know all the
                        intricacies - they eventually will end up in the back room supporting the
                        people who can get out and deal with people, which is law.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: There's no question about that having some basis. I just finished
                    talking to one of the nicest lawyers we have in this law firm, one of the
                    brightest. We had a serious conflict matter come here, and he handles conflict
                    issues, and he convinced me that we had a conflict and we shouldn't take this
                    engagement. That comes up constantly, but I just hung up talking to him. I was
                    talking to him when you came in, as a matter of fact, and I said, “Dan, I want
                    to tell you that I do a lot of dumb things, as you know, but one thing I don't
                    do is fail to listen to you fellows in areas where you know so much more than I
                    do. And while I was heartsick with your ruling that this very important person
                    that brought his problem to me, we had a conflict and I just couldn't represent
                    him. And I just want to tell you that you were right and I appreciate your
                    standing up and telling me I couldn't do that.” Of course, it pleased him, and
                    it should have pleased him, but he deserved it, and I would have erred there had
                    I not relied on someone who knew the conflict law better than I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is, of course, part of the mix of law. With a solid
                        law firm you can get both. That's what you pay for.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, I haven't drafted a contract in maybe 30 years and, good Lord
                    willing, never will have to. I could do it. I did a lot of them and I did them
                    fast and did them well, but they were not quite as scholarly, I suspect, as
                    usually drafted. I can dictate a 15-line memorandum to people in one area of the
                    law or the other and tell them what I would like to say and “Give me an op ed
                    piece on that,” and they'll turn out beautifully drafted op ed pieces. It's what
                    I said to them, but it comes back crafted beautifully.</p>

                        once in a while I read these articles by Molly Ivins, I think. She has a

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me what your impression was? You were in
                        Austin and you had this patronage job. Did you get any feel for it at that
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, you didn't have to be around the Texas legislature very long to
                    know that it couldn't be at that stage of the game a more embarrassing
                    institution, I guess. The lobbyists who had the money controlled a lot of it.
                    There were a lot of nice people in the legislature, but I used to say that these
                    lobbyists in Austin, with a bottle of whiskey and a steak or a woman could get
                    some member to vote that two and two was 13. We used to kid about it, but it
                    made you a bit cynical about things, except there were enough good people that
                    you could tell, you could make a difference. My parents were having such a
                    terribly difficult time economically, when Roosevelt came along, he was the
                    first light that we could see at the end of the tunnel. People wonder why I'm
                    such an ardent Democrat. I don't know that I'd be a Democrat or a Republican,
                    but I knew that I was for Franklin Roosevelt and whatever he was for I was
                    for.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh, yes, exactly. That's what he was to me, almost to a fault. I never
                    recognized his faults when others did. I just wasn't interested in recognizing
                    his faults. I defended him top, side and bottom, and as my state became more and
                    more Republican and more and more conservative, while I'm a pretty moderate
                    Democrat, I never considered switching. I was always proud of being a Democrat,
                    but Roosevelt captured my imagination in an unbelievable way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated in 1941 from law school, which was an
                        interesting year to come out of the womb, I'd say. What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, a very interesting thing happened. A fellow came through, a fellow
                    named Maurice Acers. He was a high-ranking FBI official, and he came through
                    Austin recruiting selected young men. He interviewed, I guess, 40 or 50 of us
                    out of my law class, knowing he was going to recommend one or two. I think he
                    recommended two people in the class, and I was one of the two, for the FBI.
                    Acers was to me then an impressive man, because he had a style and a manner. You
                    wanted to get in the FBI or you wanted to get a commission, and this FBI
                    opportunity was the first one that came up, and he recommended me, so I
                    graduated from law school and I went to a law firm and got a job at $50 a month
                    in Dallas. After a few months there, six months there or less, Pearl Harbor came
                    along, and I got a wire from John Edgar Hoover saying I had been accepted as
                    special agent of the FBI at a salary of $3200 a year. Well, $265 a month was big
                    money compared to the $50 a month I was making. And, furthermore, I had married
                    in the meantime, and you were not only deferred, you didn't have to worry about
                    the military. You couldn't get out if you wanted to; Hoover had that arranged.
                    So I spent four years as an FBI agent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a little about the training.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I trained about a third to half of the time at Quantico, Virginia; in
                    the Marine base there. The other half of the time it was books and techniques at
                    the Department of Justice in Washington. So Helen and I moved, or I moved and
                    she joined me for much of the time, in Washington during the first three months
                    of the war. Then I got assigned to various places, several places, and ended up,
                    I guess, a year before I got out transferred to Dallas, Texas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the FBI in that time, did they divvy it up as far as
                        enforcement, sort of getting out there and arresting people or investigating
                        or doing legal work? What sort of things did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I was a field agent. I was never in a supervisory capacity. Most of the
                    best agents werI wasn't among the best. When I entered the FBI, I think I was
                    the youngest agent in the FBI, and I was among the greenest. I had probably less
                    experience, was less mature, I would say. The truth of the matter is in my four
                    years in the FBI, I frequently said, the FBI did more for me in those four years
                    than I did for it. I didn't necessarily like it; there were many things about it
                    I didn't like. But I matured a great deal, and I came out of there for the first
                    time a very solid, mature, young, married man with a wife and child, and my
                    career just sort of took off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Later he became very controversial, but at the time you
                        were in there J. Edgar Hoover was considered one of the demagogues and could
                        do no wrong. It was a very button-down organization. Everybody had to wear
                        and suit...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: And a hat and a white shirt.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...no sport coats.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh, God, no! You'd look like a Communist to Hoover. I was so
                    intimidated, I was intimidated by John Edgar Hoover, by that whole operation.
                    And I grew out of that intimidated posture during my FBI time. I'm pretty sure
                    that's when I really matured, as I said earlier. I didn't have enough
                    sophistication to know just how narrow, or enough experience to know just how
                    narrow, Hoover wanted your thinking to be. He really wanted to turn them out
                    with cookie cutters. Everybody looked the same and acted the same.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a very odd person in a way when you think about
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, he was a cruel man, I think, as I look back. I'll say one thing
                    though: In those days the FBI was a system invented by a genius to be executed
                    by fools like me, is what I thought, and that's not far from the truth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of things were you doing, and where were you
                        doing them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I did a little bit of everything. Mostly in those days we did things
                    relating to the national defense, although we had regular criminal work too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before, he'd been hunting down gangsters, as they were
                        known in those days, but it had switched by the time you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: No, that's not true. We had those responsibilities. You have to keep in
                    mind they had a lot of agents who were career agents, a hell of a lot more able
                    than I was. I had a style and manner that served me well then, and then the
                    agent in charge would frequently call on me to do something public, because I
                    was pretty good at it, making a speech somewhere and that sort of thing. I might
                    be in a group of 15 to 20 agents working something, kidnapping cases, a lot of
                    national defense cases on down to personnel investigations of sensitive
                    Presidential appointees, and things like that, but I don't know that I ever drew
                    my gun but once or twice the whole time I was in the FBI. I had a wonderful
                    experience there. Earlier in my FBI career, we had had a few days' leave, as I
                    recall, over the Fourth of July, and Helen and I went home to see our families.
                    I had just been transferred to Cincinnati, Ohio; I was stationed at the time in
                    Iowa and I got transferred to the Cincinnati field office. In those days you had
                    to carry your gun at all times or they'd fire you if caught without your gun,
                    and you had to let the home office or D.C. headquarters know where you were at
                    all times: “departing Dallas by car, spending night one in Saint Louis, arriving
                    in Cincinnati,” that sort of thing. When we got transferred to Cincinnati, I had
                    heard from other agents about this great gambling place, the Beverly Club, run
                    by the Mafia, across the river over near Covington, Kentucky. I just had never
                    seen anything like that in my life (they didn't have a lot of such
                    establishments where I grew up in west Texas) and I was determined I was going
                    to see it. I liked gambling anyway, always had. I busted my tail and drove that
                    car like crazy to get to Cincinnati three or four hours before I told them I
                    would be there. I think I told them I'd be arriving and eight or nine o'clock,
                    and I got there earlier and I said, “Helen, let's get over there, register in
                    the hotel, and go to the Beverly Club” I think that was the name of it; it was a
                    Mafia operation. I got in - I forget how, but I'm sure one of the agents who'd
                    done it himself told me - and when we got in there I got a table and we sat done
                    for a nice dinner. We were going to have a nice dinner and dance. I couldn't
                    wait to go upstairs and gamble. We went upstairs and I bought $20 worth of
                    chips, which was all I was going to lose. It was a lot of money to me then. I
                    hadn't been at that table 10 or 15 minutes until I was shooting the dice - they
                    came around to me as they went around this dice table - and I leaned over and
                    was throwing the dice and as I finished, a man tapped me on the shoulder and
                    said, “Will you step over here a minute, please, Sir?” I said, “Yes, of course.”
                    My wife was there with me and I said, “I'll see you in a minute, honey.” She was
                    watching me gamble. I went over there and all of a sudden this guy kind of
                    lightly pushed me a little into a room. In there, there were a couple other
                    people, and this fellow said, “What's the idea of the gun, buddy?” I said,
                    “What?” He said, “What are you doing with that gun, bringing it I here?” I had
                    forgotten about the gun on my hip. When I leaned over, it showed. I had to make
                    a quick decision. I figured if Hoover found out I was in there, he was going to
                    fire me, and if they didn't know who I was, they were probably going to kill me.
                    I'm exaggerating, of course, to make the point of how petrified I was. So all of
                    a sudden I said, “Well, to tell you the truth, I'm an agent of the FBI.” Now,
                    Charlie, nobody ever looked less like an FBI agent than me. I was green, weighed
                    about 120 pounds, looked like I was 18 to 20 and I was 22 or 23. I thought,
                    well, I'd better tell them, so I said, “I'm a special agent of the FBI,” and I
                    reached in and showed them my credentials. They obviously thought I was looking
                    the place over to raid it because they just figured that's the kind of
                    sap-looking guy that Hoover would send in as an undercover man to get
                    information on them. Now they were as concerned as I was. They couldn't be
                    nicer. “Well, you go right out gambling. Dinner's on us. Have a good time. We're
                    always glad to see fellows like you in here.” I was so terrified about my job, I
                    went back and said, “Helen, let's get out of here.” We had ordered dinner, we
                    ate a few bites since I had quit gambling. They insisted on paying my check. I
                    insisted on paying it, so I paid my check and we went out. I'll never forget
                    that experience as a 6-month old FBI agent.</p>

                        that time. Did the Mafia or that sort of organization ever come across your
                        radar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, as a matter of fact, I remember once picking up a witness who had
                    fled who was going to testify against a ring that operated - I guess they were
                    part of the Mafia then or certainly part of the underworld - a prostitution
                    ring, and she was supposed to testify against them in New York, and they scared
                    her to death and she ran and hid and ended up in Des Monies, Iowa. Our New York
                    office wired teletype saying, “We believe Miss So-and-So fled from testifying,”
                    this, that and the other, locate her and bring her back to testify, but I had to
                    go and arrest her - not arrest her really but convince her she had to go, that
                    she couldn't be a fugitive and refrain from testifying, and we sent her back to
                    New York with somebody - I don't remember if it was me or somebody else. We did
                    that, and we also had various kinds of... I'd say 25 percent of my work involved
                    some aspect of criminal activity, whether it was fraud against the government or
                    whether it was a case of missing explosives or matters like that. A lot of it
                    was anti-espionage. We did a lot of surveillance work on suspects traveling
                    across the country . Q: One doesn't hear much about German espionage during
                    World War II in the United States, but maybe it's just that you don't hear about
                    it. What was going on?</p>
                <p>STRAUSS: There were a considerable number of German and Nazi sympathizers in this
                    country. You're too young to recall, but I think it was four to six saboteurs
                    that landed on the East Coast, for example.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I remember. They came in on a boat on Long
                        Island.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: They came in on a submarine, came into Long Island. As a matter of fact,
                    when they tried to turn themselves in in New York, the FBI took credit for
                    catching them, but the truth of the matter is they caught themselves. A couple
                    of them got scared and tried to turn themselves in to the New York field office,
                    and that agent there who took their call sent them down to Washington. He didn't
                    pay much attention to them. They had to come down to Washington and turn
                    themselves in again. They didn't get caught. As I recall, that's the way the
                    story went. But they had all kinds of things with them that were used for
                    espionage worphony passports, cameras, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in finding agents or anything like
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes and no. What would happen is that they would call the office from a
                    field office, let's say, in Washington and say that Mr. Hans So-and-So and his
                    traveling companion So-and-So will be arriving by train from Washington at such
                    and such a time, and agents from the Washington field office will be turning
                    them over to the Columbus, Ohio field office. On arrival, you would meet him
                    there. You would meet this party, and the agents would kind of turn over the
                    surveillance to the new group, and you would follow them from Columbus to Dayton
                    or Dayton to somewhere else. They were people suspected of being espionage
                    agents. During the time work was going on at Los Alamos and the atomic bomb was
                    being worked on by the Oppenheimer group, we had a lot of that sort of work.
                    There was considerable activity of that sort. Let me make it absolutely clear
                    that I was, at most, a minor player on a very good team of agentmost more
                    experienced and able than me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I imagine you were close to them. What were they
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: A lot of these were just people who were suspected of being involved in
                    espionage, and they could be traveling anywhere and each agent in each office
                    would have a limited time to be with them. One field office would turn them over
                    to the next field office at the first convenient time. Sometimes you'd stay with
                    people for a longer period of time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just wondering. Sort of the outfit that agents wore
                        was rather distinctive. Were you allowed to sort of go into...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: You could do anything you wanted to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean you could change your clothing and that sort of
                        thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I remember one of the most petrifying experience I had. I just mentioned
                    Dayton, Ohio. I remember following a fellow in, I guess, Columbus, Ohio, and his
                    next stop was Dayton, Ohio, and the guy had on a plaid coat. I followed him and
                    kept my eye on that plaid, and I damn near missed him because when he came out
                    of his hotel he no longer had a plaid coat. He had an altogether different one,
                    and I was looking for that plaid coat. He'd been wearing it for two days. I
                    didn't think he'd change then, but he did. That kind of thing. I was a pretty
                    good agent. I wasn't a star by any means. They had older and more able people
                    who had been there 30 years or more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get the feeling that Communism was as much a
                        target as Nazism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: As a matter of fact, we used to kid each other. We'd plant people into
                    those cells, and we used to kid each other that we had more people in the
                    Communist Party than the Communists did. There were so many agents that would
                    place people in the cell to penetrate it. In each large city of consequence
                    they'd work their way in. My recollection is there were a couple of times the
                    FBI agent, or the informant for the FBI agent - he was not an FBI agent, he was
                    just an informant for them - would be elected the head of the damn thing. I
                    haven't thought of those instances in 40 years, so I'm straining my memory
                    now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any feel for the American Communist
                        movement at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: I was, I guess, liberal enough in my thinking - maybe today we call it
                    progressive enough - that I understood the appeal of the Communist Party to
                    people, I thought. I couldn't understand how any American could be involved with
                    them or would buy into that, but yet I understood that these principles they
                    were enunciating, if they could deliver, then had a lot of appeal. There's no
                    question about it. But I would not have said that in the Bureau. Hoover would
                    have castrated me. He wouldn't have killed me; he would have castrated me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any stories about Hoover? Or were people
                        very careful not to talk about the idiosyncrasies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: There were already rumbles back there about there being something
                    strange about him, and it wasn't long that you began hearing - I don't think
                    they used the term 'gay' then - that he had that tendency, because he was always
                    with Clyde Tolson constantly, morning, noon and night.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they lived together.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: They lived together and traveled together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they also went to the horse races together. They would
                        have been prime suspects if you were looking for homosexuals, and then the
                        government thinking here they were.STRAUSS: And they ate every meal
                        together, I mean every meal, not most meals.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a very odd relationship. He never married, and I
                        think he lived with his mother.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Being in the FBI at this time, was this something you
                        thought about as a career or was this a wartime thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: This was a wartime thing. As a matter of fact, had I just had a little
                    more guts, I would have tried to get out of the FBI after about two years. By
                    then I realized I was sorry I wasn't in uniform, because most of my friends
                    were. The Bureau's position was you're doing more for your country right now,
                    and that's what they'd say when you'd talk to them about getting out. Everybody
                    on the outside thought you were more important in the FBI than you were. I
                    didn't think I was very important and I was uncomfortable not being in the
                    service.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a practical measure as a lawyer you probably would have
                        ended up in the Pentagon going over contracts or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I would have. There's a fellow named Arno Nowotny who was the Dean of
                    Student Life at the University of Texas. I lived with him in his home the last
                    couple of years I went to the University of Texas. I just loved him and I'm
                    still emotional when I talk about him. As a matter of fact, I named one of my
                    sons Arno after him. So he was very fond of me, and I him, but a couple of times
                    I told him that I was thinking about trying to get out of the FBI and get myself
                    in the military. And he called Helen once, and said, “Helen, don't let Bobby be
                    a damn fool. He'll listen to you. He's a damn fool if he leaves what he's doing.
                    What he's doing is important. It's just as important as any job he'll have in
                    the Army. He's not going to be dropping bombs.” So I was pushed both ways. I
                    don't have any regrets today, but I did at that time. Two or three years after
                    the war I realized that I was just fortunate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it's excellent training to have gotten the feel of
                        a government agency. Well, did you have the feeling that maybe we were a
                        little too intrusive? I was to talking to Jim Jones - this was somewhat
                        later - who was saying that Hoover was sending this stuff over, which was
                        kind of salacious, particularly about Civil Rights leaders, and they were
                        using Marvin Watson's office would filter this out. He said, you know, no
                        prosecutor would have sent this on. Did you find you were picking up stuff
                        about people that was maybe out of bounds?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: I was never asked to do but one thing out of bounds, and I didn't have
                    the courage to resist. But after I got transferred back to Dallas - we had a
                    fraud-against-the-government case that the US Attorney was trying in Abilene,
                    Texas, and the agent in charge sent me and another agent whose name was Miles
                    Hall. Miles Hall and I went to Abilene, Texas, and on the instructions of the
                    Justice Department - at the request of the Justice Department on the
                    instructions of our agent in charge - got a room next to where the lead defense
                    counsel for these defendants who had been charged with fraud against the
                    government. The purpose of that was to eavesdrop on them, and we put a
                    microphone - we didn't invade the room; I remember that vividly - but we put a
                    microphone on the wall where the telephone jack was located. You could take that
                    connection between the two rooms and without invading the room, pick up some of
                    their conversation. To be crude about it, eavesdrop on this defense lawyer
                    talking to his witnesses during this trial. Now, Miles Hall and I were both
                    embarrassed about it. We talked about how it was an outrage. He was an
                    accountant, and I was a lawyer so I was even more sensitive to the fact that
                    what we were doing was, if not illegal, damn close to it and improper to
                    eavesdrop on the defense lawyer talking to his witnesses. I felt dirty but I
                    didn't have the courage to pick up the phone and say, “Get somebody to do this.
                    I won't be involved in this.” But that was wrong and I knew it was wrong at the
                    time, but I didn't face up to it. Fortunately, the mechanism didn't work very
                    well, so we quit the effort after a couple of days. I've had experiences in my
                    life that made me learn to face up to things as I matured. As we go further in
                    this, I'll tell you several stories of how I developed a bit more courage to
                    tell people, even presidents, the unvarnished truth, even though they might get
                    mad or angry with me. I think I have that reputation, and I've done pretty well
                    at it. But I wasn't born with it.</p>
                <p>

                </p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes. We might as well take a few minutes now and let me tell you a
                    story, because it's right on point with this. In 1968 when Hubert Humphrey was
                    running for President, I was, I guess, co-chairman of that campaign with a
                    couple other people in Texas. I think finance was my primary responsibility for
                    the Texas campaign for Democrats. And Lyndon Johnson called me to Washington. I
                    saw him on October 9, 1968, at 7:30 a.m. in his bedroom. Marvin Watson was there
                    - I think it was Marvin Watson; it could have been Jim Jones, but I think it was
                    Marvin Watson who was there then. I know Tom Johnson was there then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tom Johnson being the President's brother?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: No, Tom Johnson was the head of CNN and just recently retired, but he
                    was on Johnson's staff at the White House. That's not really relevant to the
                    story; I shouldn't have strayed into it. But President Johnson gave me hell
                    about the way the campaign was going in Texas, and he said, “Goddamn it. You
                    know how to run a campaign; you know how we run them. This is not being run that
                    way. We've got to carry Texas. It would be embarrassing if we'd lose it to this
                    guy. And whether Hubert makes it or not, Texas has got to go with Hubert. Go get
                    John,” talking about then Governor John Connally, “and get him involved and tell
                    him I said this and this and this. And quit running those damn fool ads down
                    with your name down there as co-chairman or whatever it is so you can see your
                    name in the paper,” he said. Talk about being intimidated. He's the only one
                    person who really could intimidate me more than anybody in the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's a big man, isn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh, he's a big man. Even after he was old and sick, when he called on
                    the phone, I was still intimidated, and I was strong and young and successful.
                    He had my number and knew it and I knew it. But as we finished 30 minutes up
                    there in his bedroom, as I was leaving he said, “Bob, what do you think about my
                    policies?” This was during the Viet Nam war, and I told him what I thought he
                    wanted to hear, not 10 percent of which I believed, but it's what I knew the
                    President wanted to hear. I felt so dirty about it and ashamed of myself that I
                    called my wife and told her what I had done. I said, “The comforting part of it
                    is that I know Johnson doesn't give a damn what I think, so it didn't affect his
                    judgment at all. He just wanted to hear what he wanted to hear. He wanted
                    somebody to agree with him. It won't affect his judgment one way or the other.
                    He has enough sense to know enough not to rely on what I said, so I didn't hurt
                    anything except myself. But I'll tell you one thing. I'll never forget it. I'll
                    never do that again if the Lord ever gives me another chance.” Since that, I
                    have been in the White House in the President's quarters with other Presidents
                    that have asked my advice, the most notable one being Ronald Reagan when I had
                    to tell him he was dead wrong when his people were giving him advice just to the
                    contrary. When I met with him, Mike Deaver had asked me to come up, that Nancy
                    Reagan wanted me to meet with him. I said, “Why? Does he want to hear the truth?
                    If not, I'm not coming.” Mike said, “Yes, she wants him to hear the truth.
                    That's why she wants you here. She thinks you'll tell him the truth, and I've
                    told her that you'll tell him the truth.” I did tell him the truth, and he
                    didn't like it one damn bit, but he later did exactly what I suggested to him he
                    do, as she knew he would. But I wouldn't have done that, I wouldn't have said
                    what he needed to hear if I hadn't been through the Johnson experience. And I
                    wouldn't have been totally candid with Jimmy Carter on a couple of things when I
                    was at the White House, arguing with him, if I hadn't had those earlier
                    experience.</p>

                        many years, and he retired as my partner. I talked to him a few weeks ago. I

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: We opened our office and sent out announcements, and somebody would tell
                    somebody else that Strauss and Gump started this law firm. It was a little tiny
                    office. I think we paid $60 a month rent, maybe $50. We flipped a coin and said
                    if it came out heads it would be 'Gump and Strauss,' tails it would be 'Strauss
                    and Gump,' and whoever's name came out second in that would take the larger
                    office. There were two small offices, but you could get into the larger one
                    without squeezing around. I guess Gump won, 'Gump and Strauss,' and I took the
                    little-bit-larger office, and we settled everything. Never had argument in all
                    our years together.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: No, you send out announcements.</p>

                <p>STRAUSS: To friends, all your friends. You say, “Richard Gump and Robert Strauss
                    announce the formation of Gump &amp; Strauss for the practice of law at 520
                    Republic Bank Building, Dallas, Texas, telephone number so-and-so,” and sooner
                    or later some damn fool will call.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose the first people you get are people who say,
                        “They just started so they'll be cheaper.” Isn't that it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: You get some of that. What happens is that somebody who would think of
                    using you, his maid wanted a divorce and he wanted to help a little, so he'd
                    call up and say, “Bob, we've got a maid out here who wants a divorce. Would you
                    handle it for us?” “Oh, yes, sir, be glad too.” That would be 50 bucks. And then
                    some of our friends would come by and we'd talk to them about a will, and they
                    needed a will, so we'd draw up a will for them for $15 or $20. And we met people
                    in the community, we knew them, and before long... Gump had $15,000 or $20,000
                    inheritance from his parents who were killed in an automobile. I didn't have
                    that, but I asked my father-in-law if he would guarantee a note for $10,000.00
                    for me at the Republic Bank, and he said he would. Gump and I each figured that
                    if we had $10,000 we could take care of our personal living requirements for our
                    families - we each had a couple of children - and we could live and operate our
                    office until we got in the black. I guess that note got up to about $6,000 or
                    $7,000, and by that time I was getting enough income to make ends meet. We lived
                    very modestly, and Gump did the same, so I never had to go all the way to
                    $10,000.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: It was a small community compared to what it is today, but it was still
                    the second largest in the state, Houston being the largest, and it was banking
                    and insurance where Houston was oil and gas. It was a very nice, pleasant place
                    to live, an insular place, but I liked it. I did well there and made a lot of
                    friends and built a successful smaller law practice.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Dallas was just the opposite. It was where Neiman Marcus was, in
                    Dallas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, later you got very much involved in
                        international affairs. Did this cross your radar screen at all in these
                        days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: No. As a matter of fact, that's sort of a fluke. I was always interested
                    in what was going on around the world but not in trade issues; I was very
                    interested in politics. I started a modestly active political career, marginal
                    political career, part-time at best, while I was practicing law in Dallas. Then
                    my friend John Connally, eventually who became Secretary of Navy when Kennedy
                    was elected President, we decided, several of his friends, he ought to run for
                    governor. The Republicans were trying to take over the state, and Connally was
                    attractive and we thought we could win it with him and he thought so too, and he
                    desperately wanted it. In fact, he had wanted an appointment for the U.S. Senate
                    that he didn't get, that we tried to get for him, tried to help him get and he
                    tried to get. So Connally decided to run for governor, and when he did I played
                    a very significant role in that campaign and during his six years as governor.
                    It's hard to remember that John Connally was a very attractive Democrat who was
                    moderately conservative, not conservative but moderately conservative. I was
                    moderately liberal. There was a difference between us politically but not to
                    amount to anything. No one thought of him as the hard-line conservative that he
                    later became, and no one thought of me as being a liberal. But I guess they did,
                    because as a Democrat in Dallas they might have, but no left-winger, a
                    progressive sort of Democrat. At that time Democrats controlled the state, all
                    offices, everything. I began my local career from Dallas.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Dallas when you were first starting out - because when
                        you talk about Connally, you're moving back into the '60s, but let's start
                        in the '50s - when you arrived on the scene, did you get your feet at all
                        wet with politics? This was in '52.</hi>

                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: When Adlai Stevenson ran in '52, a fellow named Bob Clark was a
                    prominent Democrat and I was a Democrat of no prominence. They did know that I
                    liked to help out, and he asked me to and was glad to have me involved, and so
                    in that campaign I did a few things for him. I forget exactly what it was but
                    maybe tried to help raise a little money and probably made two or three speeches
                    in small, little meetings and things like that for him. It was something I
                    enjoyed. When Stevenson ran a second time, I had a more important role. No one
                    wanted to be involved in his campaign. He was running against Ike Eisenhower for
                    reelection. But I did, and that got me more established with the Democratic
                    Party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say talk to a few groups - I'm trying to capture the

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, what you do is you ask to speak to the Rotary Club, you ask to
                    speak to the Exchange Club, you ask to speak at the PTA. Or the PTA would want a
                    Democrat to come out, or the Rotary Club would say, “We're going to have a
                    program,” so they'd have a Republican or a Democrat or Eisenhower personally or
                    Stevenson personally. I would do a little of that. I was a pretty fair
                    speaker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the parties like in Texas in the early
                        '50s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: The Republican Party was nothing. The Democratic Party was two parties.
                    There was Alan Shivers', Governor Alan Shivers', wing, Shivocrats - you may
                    remember that name - and the other was the opposite, more loyalists, and I was
                    in that crowso was Connally because LBJ was in that group. I kind of bridged
                    both groups, to tell you the truth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Shivocrats?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: They were more hard-line conservatives. Johnson was in the other camp.
                    There was a constant struggle between the Shivers people and the Johnson people
                    for control of the state party, and I was in the Johnson crowd with Connally.
                    Alan Shivers became a friend of mine, but there was no question about where I
                    stood in those fights. So there were really two Democratic Parties; that's what
                    I'm trying to say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did the, you might say, big oil money and what would

                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, they played both sides, but Shivers had more of that than the
                    other group of Democrats did, but the Democrats had people that were some of the
                    richest people in the state, and Shivers ran as a Democrat. He wasn't a
                    Republican; it was just a wing of the Democratic Party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talk about the governorship. I've heard that the
                        governor really isn't that important in Texas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I think that's an understatement you just made, Charles. The governor is
                    the governor without any real power. He has the power of appointment, he can
                    fill a number of boards, but the lieutenant governor has the power in Texas. The
                    way it's set up, he controls things, and the governor has to get along with him
                    if he's going to get his program done. That's what our present President, Mr.
                    Bush, did successfully. He took over and captured the imagination of the
                    Democrat who was lieutenant governor and with a lot of power, and he used that
                    and he used him skillfully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would people want to be governor? It sounds like a

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, you wear a cowboy hat in the parade, you make a lot of speeches,
                    but you don't have a lot of power, and it's a distinguished job, it really is. I
                    never had any aspirations to be governor. I suspect there were times I might
                    have been elected governor of Texas, but it never occurred to me to ever want to
                    hold elective office. It never had any appeal to me.</p>

                <p>STRAUSS: I didn't specialize in that. No, I had a little different image, I
                    think. And Dallas had a different image than that. Dallas looked at New York and
                    they wanted to be another New York.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When one looks at Texas, this is a real state with all
                        sorts of conflicting interests. Were you feeling the Northerner coming in to
                        Houston early on, or did that come later?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: No, that came later, but when people were coming in there, we were
                    pleased and happy our state was growing, just like they were in California. It
                    was an attractive place to live and work and prosper. I was very proud of being
                    from Dallas, still am, although there are a lot of things about Dallas I do not
                    care for. The Dallas establishment never took to me too much. The Dallas
                    establishment in those days really controlled things through a group called the
                    Citizens' Council. I didn't want to be against them; I wanted to be for them,
                    but they didn't want me. I tried very hard to get the Citizens' Council that
                    represented the business community to endorse me as their candidate and put me
                    on their slate to be on the City Council. I'm almost embarrassed to say that the
                    height of my political ambition then was to get on the Dallas City Council as a
                    member of the establishment. I didn't want to run against them because I was
                    trying to make a living practicing law. I wanted to be a part of them; they
                    didn't want me. When John Connally ran for governor, I knew what I wanted. I
                    wanted to expand my horizons beyond Dallas. Interestingly, in that regard, after
                    Connally got elected governor, he said to me before he took office, “Strauss,
                    what do you want out of this? What can I appoint you to?” and I said, “Well,
                    you're not going to appoint me to the Board of Regents, I know that, because
                    you've got other commitments, other ideas, and we've discussed them, but that's
                    something I'd like to have someday, but I don't expect it now.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was for the University of Texas.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes. I said, “What I really want is not an appointment. I just want when
                    these Dallas businessmen come to you, this establishment here, and suggest names
                    of people they'd like appointed to this commission or that commission or this
                    board or that board, insurance or banking or whatever it is, that you say to
                    them, 'Well, I'll certainly consider that. Let me talk to Bob Strauss about
                    it.'" I said, “If you'll just promise me you'll say that, that's all you have to
                    do for me. Just say that two, three or four times: 'I'll talk to Strauss and get
                    back to you,'" because by then everybody knew I was Connally's man in Dallas. He
                    did, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I remember George Christian, who was his
                    assistant. Connally and I by then had become very, very close; we were more than
                    just good friends. When I started out with Connally, if he had 15 people to an
                    important meeting, I would have been in the 15; and then if he had half that
                    number, I might or might not have been in that cutoff; but by the time he left
                    the governorship, if he had had two people I would have been one of the two. So
                    we were very close. I remember one time a half dozen leaders in the Dallas
                    business community came in to see him on something, and John said, “Why don't
                    sit in on this meeting? You've got some of your Dallas friends in here.” I sat
                    in the meeting for a while, and Connally and I got in the kind of a good humored
                    argument we frequently got into about something or other, and I said, “Well, I
                    think that's a lot of damn foolishness,” or something like that to him. One of
                    these men hung back and thought he'd get in good with Connally, and he said,
                    “Governor, I just want you to know that I personally resented the lack of
                    respect that Bob Strauss showed you.” George Christian later told me that
                    Connally kind of grunted and, after the guy left, said to him, “George, let's
                    don't let that fellow back in my office again.” So instead of endearing himself
                    to..., but it's a story I liked. I was just petty enough to really enjoy the
                    story.</p>

                <p>STRAUSS: ...and Connally becoming governor and me being active in that campaign.
                    I think I was Co-chairman - Finance, when Humphrey ran in '68, for the state
                    campaign in Texas. A fellow named Will Davis was the Chairman, and he was a good
                    one. When that campaign was over, we had carried the state for Hubert by, as I
                    recall, around 50,000 votes. I had raised enough money to pay all our bills,
                    which was very unusual for the Humphrey campaign. They owed everybody in the
                    world, everybody in Texas where I had control of the spending, along with Will
                    Davis and, of course, the Governor</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk a bit about your initial impression of Hubert
                        Humphrey.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I had known Hubert Humphrey quite well because, when I came to
                    Washington after he became Vice President and I would go by the White House to
                    visit my friends from Texas who were on Johnson's staff, Hubert was frequently
                    around. He and I would spend time together, and he would invite me to have lunch
                    with him or he would say, “I'm having lunch with So-and-So and we're eating down
                    in the mess. Why don't you come and have a bite to eat with us,” or one of them
                    would say, “I'm having lunch with the Vice President. He'd enjoy seeing you. Why
                    don't you join us.” So I got to know Hubert pretty well. Hubert and I also had a
                    friend in common; his name was Dwayne Andreas. He was a big donor and Hubert's
                    closest friend and put up a ton of money for him. He loved Humphrey and he loved
                    Muriel. They both came from Minnesota. During his campaign, I'll never forget
                    that they were so broke, they called to see if we couldn't put together a group
                    of people in Houston that might contribute some substantial funds to him. Dwayne
                    Andreas flew down in his plane - he was really responsible for finance because
                    he was having to pay everything himself that he couldn't raise. He came to
                    Houston and had asked if I would get several people together for him. He had
                    also asked a fellow named Jake Jacobsen, who had worked in the Johnson White
                    House, to get a couple of people, and we got a number of important, well-to-do
                    people to meet with him at the airport when he flew in, when Andreas flew in,
                    not Hubert. Hubert wasn't there, but Andreas came down. I'll never forget that a
                    fellow who was in the Italian food business - Gino Paulucci was his name and
                    he's a very successful businessman. Made his fortune in selling Italian canned
                    foods and packaged foods - and Mr. Andreas and I were meeting with George Brown,
                    who is one of the well-to-do men of the state, the country, with no interest in
                    the oil business. Lloyd Bentsen, later a U.S. Senator, who had no real interest
                    in the oil business but had other interests, was also there, and two or three
                    others. And Mr. Andreas he said they would like them to contribute, to sign a
                    note for a quarter of a million dollars, and they'd borrow it at the bank and
                    then they'd get it paid off later. They resisted it, and finally Dwayne said,
                    “I'll tell you what I'll do. If you'll sign that note, be liable for $125,000,
                    I'll be responsible for the other $125,000 myself.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Tape 2 Side 1 with Robert Strauss.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: They were just about to come to a deal there when Paulucci, who was very
                    excitable, said, “Now, if you don't do this, I'll tell you what we're going to
                    do. Hubert's going to be elected President. When he's President, we're going to
                    cut off the benefits the oil industry gets, all these special benefits, and
                    you're going to suffer from it.” Well, you don't threaten people like that. Mr.
                    Brown turned almost white, and he just quietly said, “Thank you, fellows, for
                    coming down to see us, but I don't think we'd be interested in participating any
                    longer.” Paulucci had no idea what he was talking about. None of our political
                    contributors were in the oil business, and they were all offended, and there
                    went a quarter of a million dollars. I'll never forget that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did Andreas' money come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: He was and is very successful, primarily in the food processing
                    business, Archer Daniels Midland, and he still is a very big supporter of
                    political causes on both sides, as a matter of fact. He's really a Democrat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because you've been involved in money raising, I've never
                        been quite sure why people who give money to political parties, unless
                        there's obvious just plain interest - “I want to get such-and-such a bill
                        passed”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I really think that the biggest money comes from special interests that
                    have a cause, not necessarily special interests in an evil way. Some of the
                    biggest money that's been given has been given by people who care a great deal
                    about conservative or liberal issues, who care about the pro-abortion or
                    anti-abortion issue, for example. A lot of it comes from just people who give a
                    damn about issues in general. A great deal of it comes, as you know, from people
                    who want to be associated with the next President. They don't care what he
                    stands for. They want to be known as a friend of his and hope they'll get
                    invitations to the White House if he gets elected. Most of them are
                    disappointed. And a lot of it comes from people who have special selfish
                    interests that aren't benign but they really are special economic interests, and
                    a great deal of it comes from there, whether it be the drug industry, the oil
                    industry or any other industry. So it's a mix of all of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that in '68, Johnson being Texas to
                        the core, this would have aroused all sorts of support, both voting and
                        financial. Were there also forces that were really very strongly
                        anti-Johnson in Texas?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh, yes. You have to remember Texas was not really a two-party state
                    yet, and the Democratic Party was two parties. There was a liberal wing of the
                    Democratic Party, which Senator Ralph Yarbrough represented and spoke for, and
                    there was the more conservative wing which John Connally and former Governor
                    Alan Shivers and people like that spoke for. All these people just fought like
                    cats and dogs. I wasn't a conservative. I think I was looked upon as more
                    liberal than anything else in Texas, but I belonged to the John Connally wing of
                    the party. To move on to how I got out of Texas, John Connally and his wife and
                    Helen and I and others were the guests of the President of Mexico at his home in
                    Acapulco. I guess we stayed in his home. I forget where it was. It was a long
                    time now. He wasn't there. I remember we used his yacht and went out on the
                    ocean and things like that. I was down there with Connally and with Eugene Locke
                    and his wife and others when Hubert called me in 1970 and said, “Bob, I want you
                    to be Chairman of the Democratic Party. Fred Harris had failed to make it and he
                    had resigned.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were talking about how you got to Washington in 1970,
                        but I wonder if you could go back. You had run this successful campaign,
                        particularly on money, in '68. What did you do afterwards? Did you just sort
                        of slip back into legal work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: In those days each state had one National Committeeman that was male and
                    one National Committeewoman, a female, and I was the male from Texas, Mrs. Lloyd
                    Bentsen and I were the National Committee people from Texas, which made 100 of
                    us on that Committee then and it was important. Today it doesn't amount to much.
                    In those days it was a place of power and importance, and I was active. When I
                    got on the National Committee, it was pretty obvious to me, and a friend of mine
                    named Frank Erwin who had served said, “Strauss, unless you're on the Executive
                    Committee, there's no point in being on the National Committee, because you just
                    rubber-stamp what the Executive Committee does. Do your best to get on there.”
                    So Fred Harris called me and asked me to support him for Chairman. I said,
                    “Well, I'll tell you what, Fred, Senator Harris...”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's from Oklahoma.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes. I said, “If you nominate me to serve as the southern seat, let me
                    fill that, on the Executive Committee, I'll give you my support and bring you
                    the support of some other Southerners.” He said, “That's a deal.” I said, “Now,
                    Fred, Senator, you say that's a deal. When I say a deal, I mean it.” He said,
                    “Well, so do I.” I said, “Fine.” And I liked Fred Harris. Johnson didn't like
                    him and Connally didn't like him, and they thought I was making a mistake.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: They just didn't think there was much to him, and they were right. There
                    was nothing to him. He was a nothing. But I was wrong and they were right,
                    because I made that deal with him, and just before we were going to vote - a
                    couple of months later we had the election of the Chairman - just before the
                    vote came, Fred Harris, then Senator Harris, came kind of sneaking down the
                    aisle and came up behind me about a half an hour before we were supposed to vote
                    and said, “Bob, we've got a problem.” I said, “What's that?” He said, “Governor
                    McNair wants that southern seat,” and I said, “Well, Fred, Governor McNair has a
                    problem. You and I don't have a problem because we shook hands on the deal. I
                    was going to have that seat, and if I don't have it, I've got enough influence
                    with these southern delegates to assure that you ain't going to be Chairman, so
                    you won't have a problem because you won't have responsibility for picking the
                    Executive Committee.” He said, “You mean that?” and I said, “I damn sure do,
                    Senator.” He said, “Well, then, all right, you'll have it.” I said, “Fine.” So
                    he put me on the Executive Committee, and I was very helpful to him. I raised a
                    lot of money for him, for the reforms the Party was trying to put in then, the
                    McGovern reforms, if you will, and for better or for worse, it required a lot of
                    staff work, travel expenses, etc., and Harris couldn't raise any money, so I
                    raised most of it during his term as Chairman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we talking about for reforms?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: We were talking about delegate selection process and other things I
                    forget now with specificity but primarily had to do with the delegate selection
                    process and the nominating process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the '68 thing there had been this problem, a terrible
                        mess, in Mississippi and other places like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: So this was to reform all that and be assured that there was minority
                    representation and that there was male and female representation. Most of those
                    reforms, half of them, were of negative value and damaged the Party, and half of
                    them were very good. Like most things, the pendulum never stops in the middle;
                    it swings too far one way and then too far the other. But I had raised the money
                    to pay for those reform commissions meetings. There was a delegate selection
                    committee and there were some other committees, two or three of them, and we had
                    good staff people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But just to get how it worked, you had to have money in
                        order to arrange for these committees?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, if you were going to have 25 people come in from across the
                    country every three weeks, most of them are working people and the National
                    Committee had to pick up the tab for that, their travel expense, and they had to
                    have staff. Everybody has a staff, and they had to have a staff. That means you
                    have a staff director and then you have an assistant and you have a secretary to
                    the assistant and the assistant's assistant - you know what happens in politics
                    - so the first thing you know, you're spending a lot of money. And Fred was a
                    money spender anyway. He didn't have to raise it, so he was happy to spend
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were Mr. Moneyraiser?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I helped him a great deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, you were working the southern side. Johnson was
                        pushing civil rights, and this was the time when civil rights was a major,
                        really major, issue, and, working the South, I would think this would make
                        it difficult for you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: No, not at all, not at all. I was a strong civil rights man. As a matter
                    of fact, my recollection is that I signed on to one of the early briefs in
                    federal court filed in Dallas County on the side of petitioners in a civil
                    rights case. I forget what it was. These names skip my mind, they're so long
                    ago. I had relationships with people in the North and East but, coming from
                    Texas, the southern seat was what was available for me on that Executive
                    Committee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was not thinking of you personally on civil rights but
                        trying to raise money within the South.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh, no, we raised a lot of money in the South, a lot of money in the
                    South.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time within the Democratic Party and within the
                        apparatus, were there African American leaders that were influential at that
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh, yes, it was a little different type of leadership. The ministers had
                    most of it. They had most of the influence. But the reason I think I became
                    Chairman and the reason Humphrey asked me to be Treasurer - he asked me to be
                    Chairman and I ended up being Treasurer of my own choosing - Fred Harris was
                    broke, he couldn't raise $100, and he put on a fundraiser in Miami, Florida, a
                    big national Democratic gala that was supposed to raise maybe half a million
                    dollars, which was a lot of money in those days, maybe more than that. He had a
                    fellow named George Bristol who was an administrative assistant of his, and
                    Bristol was talking to me about helping to raise money in Texas. They had what
                    was obviously going to be a big failure, because they couldn't raise any money
                    anywhere in the country. I put together a planeload of people and charged them,
                    as I recall, $1,000 a head to fly over, spend the night at the hotel in Miami,
                    go to the dinner, and fly them back. I think we charged them around $1,000 or
                    $1,200 a person, and I got better than 100 people in that plane, and the
                    $100,000 was about all they raised. They didn't raise $50,000 in the rest of the
                    country, and they raised $100,000 out of that, less the expenses which were
                    about 25 percent of it. That was a big story there: “Strauss Brings Rich Texans
                    to Florida for DNC Gala.” That night after that gala, Harris had been so
                    severely criticized that he called and asked me to his room. I went there and
                    he'd been drinking and he's about half crocked. He and his aide George Bristol
                    and I were there, and he said, “I'm going to resign tomorrow. I'm a failure.” He
                    said, “I want you to be Chairman. I'm going to recommend you.” I said, “Fred, I
                    don't want to be Chairman.” But he did resign the next day. That's when the
                    opening came and that's when Humphrey called me in Mexico and asked if I would
                    be willing to be Chairman, and I said, “No, I'd like to be Treasurer.” So that's
                    how I got into...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was about 1970 or so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, I would say this was late in '69. Harris became Chairman early '69,
                    or late '68, after the Humphrey defeat. So this had to be in '69.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the Humphrey defeat, how was it viewed from your
                        perspective? What brought this about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, there were a lot of reasons. One is he stayed loyal to Johnson's
                    Vietnam policies, and they were unpopular and he didn't abandon them until he
                    made the Salt Lake City speech in which he called for withdrawal and other
                    things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes. That was a turning point, but the Humphrey-Muskie campaign had no
                    money. I traveled on that campaign plane some with Hubert, whom I liked very
                    much, still do even though he's deceased, of course. I'm trying to think what I
                    was going to say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about why he lost the election.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, he was late getting his campaign going. It was very disorganized,
                    it was poorly run, and everyone knew it. He had his hangers-on from Minnesota
                    around him, and it was tough getting it straightened out, and his biggest
                    supporter, Dwayne Andreas, knew it and it almost drove him crazy, seeing the
                    lack of organization in that campaign. But the truth of the matter is they
                    finally got it straightened out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're still talking about the '68 campaign. What about the
                        convention? This has become sort of a cultural icon or something in American
                        politics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: The Democratic Convention was taken over by... It's hard to convey the
                    hatred that Johnson aroused with the left of the Democratic Party. They gave him
                    no credit for anything that he had accomplished in civil rights and other areas.
                    Johnson brought a lot of it on himself. Half of it he brought on himself and the
                    other half was brought on by people who were totally irresponsible. The venom in
                    that convention was incredible. I don't know whether I told you the story about
                    McCarthy wanted to talk to John Connally, Governor Connally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't think. It doesn't ring a bell.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: On the Saturday night...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Eugene McCarthy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes. Let me back up and put it in better perspective for you. Eugene
                    McCarthy was trying for the nomination, and Hubert Humphrey was trying for the
                    nomination. Humphrey was way ahead and was going to be nominated. The question
                    was who would he take as vice president, and one of the people being considered
                    was John Connally, who was very annoyed because he knew that Humphrey wasn't
                    really considering him. Humphrey thought he was too conservative. My guess is if
                    John Connally had been on that ticket with him, Humphrey would have been
                    elected. Anyway, Eugene McCarthy on the Saturday night before the Convention
                    opened on Monday was with Dick Goodwin, Richard Goodwin, who is a speech writer
                    and a very gifted fellow who was sort of the right hand of McCarthy. And they
                    called Walter Jenkins in Texas, who had been Johnson's administrative assistant
                    but had left that job. He had some problems; a problem came up, a personal
                    thing. But McCarthy and he were friends, and McCarthy called Walter Jenkins in
                    Austin and asked him if he'd help him reach John Connally, he had a proposition
                    for him. Jenkins said, “Well, call Bob Strauss. Strauss and Governor Connally
                    and his wife are sharing a suite in Blackstone Hotel.” We weren't; we had
                    adjoining suites, but I remember he said that. He said, “He'll put you in touch
                    with John Connally if he wants to, but that's how you reach him.” When Walter
                    told me he had had that call and what he told him to do, I said, “Well, what
                    does he want?” He said, “I don't know but he has a proposition for Connally and
                    he wants to tell it to him straight.” So sometime that next morning, I guess, it
                    was six o'clock when the phone rang in our room. My wife and I were awakened by
                    it, and it was Dick Goodwin, who said, “Strauss, I'm calling for Gene McCarthy.
                    He and I have a suite up here two floors above you. Senator McCarthy wants to
                    talk to Governor Connally. Can you set it up?” I said, “Yes, I'd had the call
                    from Walter Jenkins.” Jenkins had called at 11 o'clock at night, and this was
                    six the next morning, so I said, “I haven't had a chance to even mention it to
                    Governor Connally. He and his wife were asleep and they are now, and I'd be if
                    you hadn't called me. But when they wake up, we usually have coffee in his
                    suite, and I'll see what he says.” So Helen and I went to the Connally's' suite
                    for coffee, which we did in the mornings during that Convention, and I told him
                    McCarthy wanted to talk to him and about the calls I'd had. He said, “I'm just
                    kind of curious to see what it is. Tell him to come on up.” So it turned out - I
                    had notified them - about an hour later a knock came on the door at the
                    Connally's' suite and it was Dick Goodwin, not McCarthy, and he said, “The
                    Senator asked me if I would come up and explore what he wants to talk to you
                    about with you.” So we talked to him a couple hours, during which he said,
                    “McCarthy wants you to endorse him instead of Hubert Humphrey. It'll startle
                    this Convention and it'll bring the South along and others, and we can stop
                    Humphrey. McCarthy will be the nominee, and the quid pro quo on that will be
                    that McCarthy wants to assure you that if we pull this off, he will name you as
                    his Vice Presidential choice, and he thinks you can win the Presidency. He will
                    commit to splitting the patronage with the Vice President 50-50 right down the
                    middle, starting with the Cabinet and Supreme Court and right on down. You'll
                    always have 50 percent of the patronage of the White House! This was about as
                    cold-blooded and bad a scheme as I've ever heard. In the meantime, while we were
                    talking, there were kids for McCarthy out there getting their heads beat in in
                    the park by the cops clubbing them, and they're being “sold out” in a luxurious
                    suite in the hotel across the street from the park. We talked to Goodwin about
                    two hours. It was an interesting two hours, but it wasn't very constructive, it
                    was just interesting. He told us how they'd run McCarthy's campaign in New
                    Hampshire and other things. After an hour and a half to two hours, Connally said
                    he wouldn't consider a thing like that. That ended that. I had recent occasion
                    in the last year to talk to Dick Goodwin about it. He remembers it precisely as
                    I do. McCarthy, who I've asked about it, says that he has no recollection of it.
                    I don't blame him for not remembering it. I like Gene McCarthy, and he and I see
                    each other at the Palm Restaurant for lunch once a week. But that's one of the
                    worst stories I've ever been involved in.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the relationship with Mayor Daley? He became a
                        major figure in helping frankly to stir up the mob. Did you all get involved
                        with him at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: No, we really didn't have any involvement with the Mayor. He was running
                    his business in the Convention. Daley was for Hubert Humphrey, so to that extent
                    we were involved with him. Later in my political life I had a good deal to do
                    with Mayor Daley and his two sons, present Mayor Daley and his other son, Bill,
                    who was in the Clinton Cabinet. They are good friends whose friendship I value.
                    Interestingly, I don't think people in Chicago thought it could happen, but the
                    son is, in my judgment, an even more successful Mayor than the father.</p>

                    out without police protection. The lobby was filled with smoke from people
                    throwing smoke bombs in there into the hotel, and it was dangerous. Remember the
                    big fight over that was the unit rule had a lot to do with Texas, as many other
                    states did, particularly the Southern states. They built their delegations
                    around the unit rule. You probably don't know what the unit rule is precisely,
                    but the unit rule meant that a majority of the delegates would vote as a unit on
                    an issue. So you could have blacks and browns and greens and environmentalists
                    and anti-environmentalists and males and females, everything in the world, so
                    long as you controlled it enough. If they had 100 delegates, if you had 51 of
                    them, you could make up the delegation anyway you wanted to because nobody's
                    vote counted. They would vote as a unit. The Convention was called, and the
                    terms of it permitted the unit rule. After they got [inaudible] to Chicago, the
                    left wing of the Democratic Party voted to disband the unit rule. A number of
                    states, primarily southerners again including Texas, resisted that and said,
                    “We're prepared to vote to get rid of the unit rule, but you don't change the
                    terms in the middle of the game. We came here thinking our delegation could be
                    made up with the unit rule, and now we're not going to give it up for this
                    convention. We'll do it the day after the convention. There will no longer be a
                    unit rule. And that was a fight. The pro-unit rule forces won. That was at the
                    heart of this, because that's the only way they thought they could stop
                    Humphrey, by getting rid of the unit rule. So all the Humphrey people were for
                    the unit rule, too, even though their people were not. They wanted it because
                    under the unit rule they knew they would control, they'd lose no delegates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you look at this, you look at Hubert Humphrey - he's
                        been sort of a liberal's liberal, and yet you had the left going against him
                        - and Eugene McCarthy, who never struck me as being very sound.</hi>

                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: He was never responsible; he was irresponsible. Later, he became a
                    popular fellow around town and, as I said, he and I have a very cordial
                    relationship which we both enjoy.</p>

                        that I did this. Had Nixon been nominated before the Convention?</hi>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Nixon, Nixon, Nixon. If you look at what was accomplished by Nixon in
                    his Presidency, if you look at the good side, he was a splendid President; if
                    you look at the negative side of him, he was a terrible man. But he had a good
                    record as President on a number of important issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and in foreign policy first rank.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: And in domestic policy, he had liberal policies, far more progressive
                    than his party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But at the time it seemed pretty clear. If you happened to
                        be of even a modestly liberal persuasion, you had the forces of evil on the
                        Nixon side and the forces of good on the Humphrey side, and maybe McCarthy,
                        but still, if you had to choose... And yet here these people were
                        essentially working to hand the election to Nixon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: And they did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But were the people, you say, on the left, were they
                        reachable? How did this work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, Hubert represented what I thought was responsible liberalism, and
                    McCarthy, I thought, was irresponsible liberalism, and I thought he cared
                    nothing about the Party and nothing about the election. It was all about Gene
                    McCarthy. He had a tremendous ego, and he despised Hubert Humphrey. He didn't
                    dislike him; he despised him. They came from the same state and they had
                    competed with each other, and he was determined to stop Humphrey and hopefully
                    get it himself. I guess that's the way Humphrey and I became friends. I helped
                    him in that struggle.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Humphrey feel about McCarthy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: He had no particular use for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't want to put words in your mouth, but was it more
                        visceral on the part of McCarthy and less visceral on the part of...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I think it was the nearest thing to a draw in the world. It was about a
                    tie, because keep in mind that happens frequently in states. You have two
                    prominent politicians in the same party who compete with each other at every
                    level. There are people that dislike the other side's people. The staffs cause
                    more problems than the principals do usually. But it was very intense as is
                    frequently the case. For example, if a state's two Senators are of the same
                    party, they rarely have a good relationship. They distrust the other, but if one
                    is a Democrat and the other a Republican, they usually have a pretty good
                    relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The McCarthy supporters later came to considerable
                        prominence, including President Clinton. Did you get any feel for sort of
                        this very bright group of people who seemed to be trying to tear the edifice
                        down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, that's exactly what people thought, but I would remind you that
                    Bill Clinton went to work for Humphrey's campaign - no, it wasn't Humphrey's
                    campaign, it was somebody else's. But I'm sure he helped in that campaign too.
                    He wasn't so pro-McCarthy that he was anti-Humphrey, I don't think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It just seems very difficult to be anti-Humphrey.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, but we couldn't get the left to turn out for him till the last
                    week. I'm a little prejudiced, I'm sure, but I have little doubt that if that
                    campaign had gone on two more days Humphrey would have been President. Humphrey
                    closed a tremendous gap. We began to put the party together down there in Texas.
                    We had Ralph Yarbrough and John Connally traveling across the state together - I
                    think we spoke of that earlier - and that carried the state, not what people
                    like Bob Strauss did or even what Humphrey or Muskie did, but what Connally and
                    Yarbrough getting together did. It was a big national story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you working to get these two together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh, yes. When Humphrey arrived in the state to start the cross-state
                    joint appearances, I met them in Texarkana, as I recall.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At a certain point was there a realization that we'd
                        better get this together?STRAUSS: Oh, no, they just were together for that
                        campaign, and Johnson saw to it. We all worked together.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the use of Johnson in the campaign?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: He didn't do much. He didn't do anything till the end. At the end he
                    campaigned in Houston the last two days before the election in south Texas with
                    Connally and Hubert, so he had obviously much to do with our carrying the state.
                    But he really didn't do anything until the last few days, and Humphrey didn't
                    want him involved. You forget how unpopular Lyndon Johnson was at that time,
                    that he caused such negative, visceral reaction of people, and he knew it. You
                    couldn't take him into a crowd without the crowd being aroused with anti-Johnson
                    attitudes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it the war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh, yes, that's all it was, Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was sort of in the heart of the Democratic Party
                        where you were about the war at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, most of them were about like I was. You start off where Johnson
                    was, and as it went along you began more and more to realize it was a lost
                    cause, that we ought to declare victory and go home, Senator Aiken said. As I
                    said, it was about 10 days before the election that Hubert spoke in Salt Lake
                    City and renounced a good deal of the Johnson Vietnam program. He'd stayed with
                    Johnson till then. If he had made that speech a week or two earlier, he would
                    have been President.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you and others saying do this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh, yes, a lot of people were saying that then, mostly only to each
                    other. We didn't have the guts to say it to Johnsoonly about him. HHH had made a
                    commitment when he accepted the Vice Presidency that he would remain a loyal
                    supporter as long as LBJ was Presidenand he kept his word until almost the very
                    end. It didn't take a rocket scientist to know that you had to get out of that
                    trap if you were going to have any chance to be elected President, and it was
                    wrong.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: No. Things were going on, yes. There's no question that Nixon's people
                    were in touch with the Vietnamese. They weren't interested in seeing this thing
                    resolved until after the election.</p>

                <p>STRAUSS: Madam Chiang Kai-shek, for example. I remember she delivered a message

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, of course, yes. We thought at one time that night of the election

                    wasn't going to make it. We knew it. I remember calling Hubert at, I think,
                    Dwayne Andreas' home. They called me for something, and they were together,
                    Dwayne Andreas and Humphrey, and at that time it looked like we could make it.
                    But Hubert came on the line and told me that he was worried because he'd lost -
                    I forget what state it was - and it didn't look good at all. The public at that
                    time still thought... He missed it by a couple votes in each precinct. The
                    country would have changed had he won, in my opinion and the opinion of many

                <p>STRAUSS: No, I was no reformer. I don't want to try to hold myself out as a
                    reformer. I got elected Chairman, but as a Treasurer I had supported the reform
                    movement in the Party to a reasonable extent. But I couldn't support some of the
                    nutty things that were being suggested. I had raised the money, as I said
                    earlier, to pay for the reform program. But I wouldn't hold myself out as
                    belonging to the reform wing of the Party. I belonged to what was the Connally
                    wing of the Party, and that was not looked upon in any way whatsoever as a
                    reform wing. We were old politics. I think that's a fair statement.</p>

                <p>STRAUSS: You had to assure - and this was only right - you had to assure a better
                    participation on the part of the black community and the Hispanic community and
                    the women, and these reforms were calculated to do that. Some of them were very
                    constructive and helpful, and some of them were foolishness and not helpful in
                    any way. I don't remember precisely what they were but some of them were
                    ludicrous and some of them were very sound. That's about the time I was
                    Treasurer as these reforms were being dealt with by various committees. By the
                    time I became Chairman, which was in December '72, the reform movement was well
                    underway. Barbara Mikulski, now a first rate Senator, was prominent in it, and
                    former Governor and Senator Terry Sanford of North Carolina also were prominent
                    and each chaired commissions. I was the Chairman of the Party and funded them
                    and worked with them.</p>

                <p>STRAUSS: Oh, yes, very much so, and Nixon wanted to make it as pronounced as he
                    could, but he also wanted to broaden his appeal in any way he could. And Nixon,
                    if you go back and look at his record - whether I liked him or disliked him is
                    not the issue - he had a number of very progressive programs that he passed and
                    put in place, and he certainly did a number of good things on the foreign policy
                    side. He had a very able Secretary of State in Henry Kissinger, and he supported
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did foreign policy matter other than the Vietnam War?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I don't think at that time it did. These were domestic issues after
                    that. Keep in mind Nixon had been President for a couple years before Vietnam
                    moved off the stage, and those scars lingered for a long time.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: They were gone earlier than that. I think I said to you earlier in this;
                    if so, it's worth repeating it. Lyndon Johnson said to several of his staff when
                    he passed the civil rights legislation, “This will be the end of the Democratic
                    Party as we know it in the South. I don't know how we'll ever elect a Democrat
                    again once we get through doing this, because we'll lose the South.” He turned
                    out to be so far ahead of all the rest of us, it's amazing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So by the time the '72 election came up, you were the
                        Chairman?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: The '72 election was McGovern's year. People were pretty fed up with
                    McGovern, who was simply a first-rate fellow but, as I said earlier, I didn't
                    think so at the time and neither did many others. After his defeat - I think I
                    may have mentioned to you, or I may not have, earlier in this - at that '72
                    Convention, during which I was Treasurer, a number of people like Senator Henry
                    “Scoop” Jackson, Senator Fritz Hollings, and later Speaker Tip O'Neill and a
                    number of that group talked with me about running for Chairman. George McGovern
                    had named a woman from, I think, Iowa or something like that. I forget where
                    she's from. Jean Westwood was her name, very nice lady, but shouldn't have been
                    Chairman of the Democratic Party at that time. So with their help, Vera Murray,
                    my colleague then and now, mounted a campaign for my chairmanship. By then the
                    committees were much larger. Instead of two from each state, they had eight, 10,
                    12, 14 from some states. There were 400 people on the National Committee
                    probably. So it was not an easy task. When I sought the chairmanship, it was 45
                    days after the election or less; it was in December after the November election
                    which McGovern had lost so badly. During that election John Connally had come
                    out and ran Democrats for Nixon. Here he is, my closest friend, running
                    Democrats for Nixon, which was a terrible thing to do. I was trying to be
                    elected Chairman of the Democratic Party and everybody thought it was a fool's
                    errand. They didn't know that I had a great many relationships that were not
                    necessarily pro John Connally. I had more liberal support than anyone knew. The
                    Democratic governors all supported me with one or two exceptions, and I had
                    support from Averell Harriman to the Labor chiefs, and I managed to get elected
                    Chairman in December of 1972, and my national political career took off
                    dramatically at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened with John Connally?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: John Connally became disenchanted. I never saw John Connally make a
                    serious political misstep in his life until he switched parties, and I never saw
                    him make a good step after that. It's the damnedest thing in the world. Whether
                    it was in the field of economics, his personal economic security, or whether it
                    was his political career - he ran himself for the presidency and spent a ton of
                    money and got one delegate. He never understood that when he made that switch
                    the Republicans would never trust him, because he looked like the fellow who'd
                    come to steal the chickens out of the hen house, and the Democrats despised him
                    for running out on them. Strangely he and I remained very close friends. He had
                    been very helpful to me in getting involved deeply in state and national
                    politics, and I never forgot that. He and his wonderful wife, Nellie,
                    appreciated my loyalty, I'm certain, and it was easy for me to do it because I
                    was one of his greatest admirers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this one of these things where he just felt it was a
                        better thing...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: I think that he thought that was his one chance to be President. While
                    Nixon was President he named Connally Secretary of Treasury. Later, Nixon tried
                    to deliver the Vice Presidency to Connally, did his best but couldn't get it
                    done. When the office became vacant after Agnew resigned, Nixon suggested John
                    to the Republican and Democratic leadership on the Hill, but they both told
                    Nixon that neither side would support the nomination and that he was too weak
                    politically to fight for Connally, so when he asked who they would suggest, I've
                    always understood that Carl Albert, then Speaker, suggested Jerry Ford as a
                    person who could be easily confirmed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the themes that runs through American politics is
                        this Presidential bug which seems to destroy an awful lot of people. Once
                        they get on to it, they begin to look... Howard Stassen's a particular
                        egregious case but there are others. Somehow or another, once they got onto
                        it they lose perspective.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: They never get over it. It's a terrible drug; affects them like a
                    drug.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any talks with John Connally?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh, I had a lot of talks with him. The only falling-out we had came at
                    that time, because we were very close personal friends prior to that and up
                    until his death, and his wife and I are still very close. She disapproved of the
                    change. I do remember when John decided to run for the Presidency, the night
                    before he announced, Nellie Connally, John Connally's wife, called Helen, my
                    wife, and said, “Helen, John and I are so unhappy that you and Bob won't be a
                    part of our life during this exciting new adventure we're getting into,” and
                    Helen said she too was sorry but it wasn't to be. I remember her telling me
                    that, and I said, “Honey, it's going to break her heart when she sees where this
                    damn fool decision ends up, because both sides are going to dislike him,” and
                    they did. He was a very talented fellow, one of the most impressive people I've
                    ever known, but he got too far to the right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there forces within Texas that sort of pushed people
                        towards the right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I think Texas became more and more conservative obviously, and now
                    there's not a Democrat holding a statewide office. We went from a one-party
                    state, Democratic, in a period of 20 years to a one-party state, Republican, and
                    the state is very Republican-oriented now, of course, with a Texan and a
                    Republican in the White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a demographic change or an attitudinal
                        change?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh, no, it was a demographic change. The South was more and more
                    conservative all along and the Republican Party more conservative than the
                    Democratic Party. You know, I've always had a very strong feeling that the
                    two-party system served this country extremely well, and splinter parties only
                    hurt, and the best kind of two-party system is one where the Democrats tilt just
                    a bit from the center towards the left and the Republicans tilt just a bit from
                    center towards the right, and that the extreme left wing of the Democratic Party
                    and the extreme right wing of the Republican Party sort of serve as anchors out
                    there but you just don't want to let their voices be too strong or they'll push
                    the parties one way too far to the left or the other way too far to the right. I
                    think I have it about right in my mind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the '72 election was there a feeling that this isn't

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: No, in the '72 election we came within a handful of votes of making a

                <p>STRAUSS: Oh, I'm mistaken, you're talking about '72, the McGovern election, oh,
                    yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When McGovern was nominated, what...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, let me tell you what I thought at the time. At the time I thought
                    I didn't know how long it would take the Democratic Party to recover from
                    McGovern's defeat. The truth of the matter is it didn't take very long. I
                    wondered how the Republican Party would ever get over Goldwater's defeat. Both
                    parties recovered and elected presidents the next election.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about McGovern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: At that time the McGovern people, his staff people, disliked me,
                    detested me, and I returned the feelings with enthusiasm, because I took them on
                    at every turn. It was obvious that, as fine a man as George McGovern was, they
                    were weakening the party. They couldn't believe I was going to be elected
                    Chairman in that climate, that Bob Strauss, who was a John Connally or a Dick
                    Daley or a Lyndon Johnson Democrat, could be elected Chairman of the Democratic
                    Party. I always thought I could. What they never understood was that I had
                    support from all wings of the Democratic Party, because they all knew me, knew I
                    was honest and knew I gave a damn about the Party and knew I was pretty well in
                    the middle. I certainly wasn't a liberal and I certainly wasn't a conservative.
                    I used to say, “Tell me the issue and I'll tell you whether I'm liberal or
                    conservative on that issue.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about some of the staff that hangs around a
                        candidate, and this is true in Congress, the staff and all. These often have
                        a focus or an ideology of their own, which is not necessarily that of the

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, a lot of these candidates are staff-driven on issues, no question
                    about it. Vera Murray, whom you were just talking to, my assistant for over 30
                    years, watches over me like a mother hen and she sees that I get straight
                    information from my staff. I'm not staff driven. I may be Vera Murray driven but
                    not staff driven.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think somebody like George McGovern's staff would
                        be so almost ideologically driven that they would be very difficult to deal
                        with because they were true believers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, they were true believers is right. They had a very bright guy whose
                    name was Alan Baron, and he was George McGovern's number-one man, and he was a
                    true believer. In later years he was at the Democratic National Committee when I
                    got elected Chairman. I couldn't wait to fire him. I got elected on a Saturday
                    night, and I just hated it that the next day was Sunday because I wanted to fire
                    him the next day and I had to put it off till Monday. When I got to my office on
                    Monday I had his resignation he wrote out. He was smarter than me. He had
                    written it out on a Sunday and left it on my desk, so I didn't get to fire him.
                    Later he and I became more than casual friends, good friends. I took him and his
                    mother to lunch, as a matter of fact, just a few years before he died, a year or
                    so before. He was very much on the far left, but he was smart and a lot of fun
                    to be around.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I couldn't then because he was so ideologically driven. He didn't know
                    me personally. He'd heard about this right-wing ogre from Texas who had taken
                    over the Party and he was resisting that.</p>

                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, I guess there's always been a strong voice of liberalism in the
                    Democratic Party, as there should be, just as there should be a strong voice of
                    conservatism in the Republican Party. He was a very good politician, Alan Baron,
                    but he was so ideologically hung up he wasn't very effective, but he was an
                    attractive guy and bright as he could be. I kind of liked him and we became, as
                    I said, good friends. George McGovern turned out to be, I think, one of the
                    great citizens of this country. If you had told me that I'd ever say that back
                    in 1970, I would have said, “You're out of your mind, Charlie.” This man was a
                    great war hero, but he never used that, for example, in his campaign.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Nothing. He was positioned. He positioned himself terribly. He had a
                    great line he used. He spoke at the Gridiron dinner the following year and he
                    said, “You know, I wanted to run for President in the worst sort of way, and I
                    did!” It was a great line and brought the house down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the problem the ideology of the left really?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: It sounded good if you said it real fast, but when you looked at it, so
                    much of it was totally impractical, and George McGovern knows that better than
                    anyone. But on many of the issues, he was right, but he was positioned too
                    poorly to be effective, even on those issues. He's a very popular man in this
                    country today. There are still people who say to me, “Strauss, were you ever a
                    McGovernite?” as if it was a nasty word.</p>

                        '72 campaign. Did Watergate intrude? I'm just going to put this in, and
                        we'll talk about Watergate and some of the turmoil that went around it and
                        maybe any contacts while you were Democratic Chairman about dealing with the
                        Republican. Do the Republican and Democratic Chairmen get together and divvy
                        up the pie or do anything like that? I'll ask those questions next

                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is October 28, 2002. Mr. Ambassador, Watergate?</p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, I had an interesting experience with Watergate. I guess I had the
                    rarest view of anyone I know. While I was Treasurer of the Democratic Party,
                    Larry O'Brien was Chairman, and there was a fellow named Bob Schmidt, who was
                    with ITT Corporation - he represented them down here, and his assignment was to
                    cover the Democratic Party. He called me one day - we were friends, casual
                    friends; he was a younger man and a nice man - and he said, “Bob, I really need
                    to see you.” I said, “Fine.” He came over and said, “I've got a serious problem.
                    I'd like your advice on what to do about it. I trust you and you're honest.” I
                    said, “Well, I hope so.” He said, “There's a story being worked by a reporter of
                    the St. Louis Post Dispatch,” I think it was then, “and she has a story she is
                    working on that says that the Republicans took a $400,000 contribution from ITT
                    and for that they got an agreement from the White House that they would let a
                    big acquisition that ITT was trying to make go through instead of the Justice
                    Department blocking it on antitrust grounds.” I forget what the merger was. I
                    had known but now we're talking about 30 years ago or more, so I forget that.
                    And he said, “Now that this story's coming out, they're claiming that it was a
                    contribution for the Republican Convention to help pay for it and that was why
                    we gave them $400,000.” I said, “Well, is there any truth in the allegations
                    that there was some kind of quid pro quo?” He said, “I'd rather not answer that
                    question, Bob.” I said, “I'm not going to withdraw it, but I'm going to remember
                    what your answer was.” I said, “I guess the only thought I have is if you're
                    smart you would make an equal contribution to the Democrats,” me being Treasurer
                    of the Democratic Party, “and earmark it for the Democrats' convention expenses
                    to help them. Then you would have some evidence that bolstered that story of
                    yours a good deal.” He said, “Damn, I don't know why I didn't think of that.
                    That's an expensive way out,” he said, “but a good way out.” I said, “Now, let
                    me tell you, I don't think we'd take it. We don't have anything going for us
                    much, and I'm not sure at all that Chairman O'Brien, who has the final say on
                    this, would want to take it or not, because this story could grow into something
                    and we have so little going for us right now.” Keep in mind this was Nixon's
                    reelection campaign and we really were not in the race.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And McGovern was the candidate who was seen as a
                        loser.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: That's right, so we had nothing going for us, and I said, “I think Larry
                    may say that we'd pass up this contribution, because, with your permission, I'm
                    going to tell him precisely what our conversation was.” He said, “Well, I
                    understand that.” So we were over in the Watergate building, as a matter of
                    fact, where we had our offices, and O'Brien and I went downstairs to a club the
                    Democratic Party had and had lunch. I called him for lunch. He had an
                    engagement. I said, “Break your engagement because I really need to talk to you
                    about something,” and at lunch I told him this story of my conversation with the
                    ITT representative. I said, “I have an opinion on whether we ought to take it or
                    not, but I'll wait till I hear yours.” He said, “Can you pay for this
                    convention? Can you raise enough money to pay for the damn thing if we turn down
                    money like this?” I said, “Yes. We can use it, and we can spend some money we
                    couldn't otherwise, but we can pay for the convention and can have a good
                    convention. I'm raising enough money to see us through if we're careful.” He
                    said, “Then I think we probably ought to turn it down because” - he said the
                    same thing I did - “we have nothing else going. This could be a big story.” I
                    said, “That's my thought. I fully agree. I don't want to take it.” He said,
                    “Let's turn it down. Tell him to go to hell.” I said, “I will. I'm supposed to
                    meet Bob Schmidt and the vice president of ITT,” whose name I ought to remember
                    but I don't right now. I said, “I've got a date to meet him at six o'clock in
                    the Madison Bar, Madison Hotel Bar, and Schmidt's going to give me his answer,
                    and I'm going to give him mine, and he's got this vice president with him.” I
                    went in the Madison Bar, and as I was getting seated, Schmidt said, “You've got
                    no deal. So-and-So here” - I can't think of his name no“says he went to the old
                    man” - who is the guy who was chairman of IT“and he turned him down cold. I took
                    it straight to Geneen.” He added that Geneen said, “I'm not going to let anybody
                    shake me down for $400,000.” When Bob Schmidt, who was a very good guy and very
                    embarrassed, told me this, I replied to him, or his Vice President, “Well,
                    that's good, because I'm sorry I didn't get to tell you to go to hell before you
                    told me you were turning it down, because I had lunch with O'Brien and he said
                    we didn't want the money.” I said, “I just have one comment to make, then we can
                    finish our drinks.” This fellow with Schmidt said, “What's your comment?” I
                    said, “I don't know where this is going to end, but I have a hunch that's going
                    to be the most expensive $400,000 ITT ever saved if they could have spent it.”
                    That was the first break in that story. This reporter out there was working on
                    this story and they couldn't shut her up, and that was the beginning of the
                    Watergate story. I've thought about it many times. Later I was in Texas one
                    weekend and O'Brien called me and said, “Bob, we've had a break-in at our
                    offices, and they have found that one of these burglars had in his notebook the
                    White House switchboard number written down, with no name but he had an
                    extension number. And I think there may be something to this.” I said, “Well,
                    it's awful strange he had that number.” Both of us suspected there was
                    skullduggery going on anyway, and he said, “I'm going to go ahead and blast them
                    right now.” And again he said, “You know, we just don't get any chance to get
                    any real publicity.” So O'Brien jumped on the story. I did say to him, I'll
                    never forget, I said, “Larry, keep my name out of this damn story, because I
                    think it's probably a wild goose chase. I think we ought to blast it, but I'd
                    just as soon, since you're going to do it, leave me out of it.” He laughed and
                    we laughed. So he kicked the hell out of the Republicans with that story, and
                    everybody was enraged that he made a suggestion that the Republican National
                    Committee or, even worse, people representing the White House could be involved
                    in a burglary. Well, you know what happened. They were deeply involved and it
                    eventually brought down a President.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think this ITT episode may have helped trigger the
                        desire of the Republican campaign to get inside the Democratic Party to find
                        out what was going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: No, I don't think that. I think what they were looking fothey were so
                    stupid, I'm certain now and I've talked to too many people involved, the Nixon
                    White House was paranoid about Larry O'Brien, not about me. I wasn't prominent
                    enough then; I was significant but not prominent. O'Brien was prominent and far
                    more visible than me. After all, I was the Treasurer. Nixon was almost certain
                    that O'Brien was on the payroll of what was his name, very strange
                    millionaire...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Howard Hughes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: ...Howard Hughes. O'Brien did have a public relations office, and I
                    think one of his clients was Howard Hughes. They thought they could find a
                    contract over there between O'Brien and Hughes, and that's what they were after.
                    There's no question in my mind about that. It's also stupid when you stop and
                    think. McGovern was already terribly behind and the Democrats had nothing going
                    for them, and there was no reason for any of this. By the way, Larry O'Brien was
                    not only a good guy to work with, but also a very, very smart politician and I
                    learned a great deal as his Treasurer that served me well after I became
                    Chairman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, you look at these things and there is almost
                        something like the Greek tragedy. People are brought down by their own
                        weakness, which in this case was essentially paranoia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: That's right. Our trouble was, both Larry O'Brien and I, we couldn't
                    believe that these stupid acts were taking place, because there was no reason
                    for any of them. If we knew what bad shape we were in, they had to know even
                    better than we did what good shape they were in. But they kept compounding their
                    crime. Q: What do you do, a national committee, when you've got some weeks to go
                    before the election and you realize you really have a losing battle? Do you make
                    calculations: All right, our guy can't win but we'll try to do this or we'll try
                    to do that, or we'll position ourselves for the next one? What are you talking
                    about?</p>
                <p>STRAUSS: You try to cushion your losses as best you can. That's what I always try
                    to do, and try to save as much as you can. If you know in time, you can save a
                    lot of things, some Senatorial and Congressional seats, House seats, for
                    example, and your image and other things you can keep in a state of repair for
                    the next go-around. What's that old line? There are no final battles in
                    politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think there could be battles between the
                        Presidential supporters and you might say the Congressional supporters.
                        You're sitting there with money, and at a certain point I would think there
                        would be a calculation: Our guy at the top isn't going to win, but let's get
                        our guys who are in Congress and siphon more money there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, that's what you do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the McGovernites would say, “The hell with that. We
                        want all the money.” Did you have battle royal with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, yes, except that by then they had taken over the National
                    Committee. It was their show, and we were out. They ran the campaign and they
                    had taken over the National Committee in that case. The interesting thing is, as
                    I've said earlier, George McGovern is an extremely sensible man, but when you
                    get caught up in Presidential politics, it's a terrible drug and it affects your
                    judgment. I'll guarantee you that George McGovern thought that they could pull
                    this out until the votes started coming in, and his people did. They thought all
                    these young people were going to come out and vote. Well, they didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this point what was your feeling about Nixon and his
                        crew around him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I thought they were a bad lot, I really did. The interesting thing is in
                    my case I developed a more favorable impression of Richard Nixon after his
                    disgrace than I had before. I may have gone into this earlier, but he and I
                    agreed on China and several other issues that there wasn't much support for.
                    When I came out to support George H.W. Bush when he was President with China
                    policy early in the game, publicly, where few people were, Republicans or
                    Democrats, Richard Nixon called and congratulated me on that and said, “You
                    know, I think you and I are the only two people who have spoken up on this
                    issue. I want to thank you.” I think I may have mentioned earlier that he
                    invited me for dinner, and we had several nice dinners together at his request,
                    although I must say that I don't think any better of him nor do I think any
                    worse of him, but I had a better relationship with him than most people, and I
                    appreciated several things about him. See, I think Richard Nixon could have made
                    a first-rate President. He understood the Presidency. He was right on some very
                    big issues, he was right, and he was ahead of his time on those issues. They
                    were progressive issues. His was not an arch-conservative administration. And he
                    just blew it. It was that paranoia that got him.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting because I've talked to many people in the
                        Foreign Service who dealt with Richard Nixon when he was Vice President and
                        President,, and, you know, they came away from that with a great deal of
                        respect for the man. He listened carefully. He obviously thought hard. He
                        was really very good in foreign relations, yet he detested the Foreign
                        Service. I think he thought they looked down on him when actually the people
                        I know who dealt with him did not. They appreciated having somebody who knew
                        the terrain.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I would think so. But you have to remember one thing about Richard
                    Nixon: He was uncomfortable around people. He was an uncomfortable man, and he
                    was uncomfortable around people. One or two friends was about all he was

                    her. With his two daughters he was very comfortable.</p>

                <p>STRAUSS: Bebe Rebozo and one or two others, Robert Abplanalp or whatever his name
                    was, but that was about it. He just didn't like people, and he didn't like small

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I liked Henry. Henry and I were friends, and he used to kid me because I
                    spoke before the Democratic Convention in I guess it was '72 and I took on
                    Kissinger and one or two others and tied them all up with Nixon. But I liked
                    Henry then and he me, I think, and I like him now. You talk about people in
                    politics. Do you realize how long it's been since Henry Kissinger was in office,
                    and he has more power, I think, today because of his position and his posture
                    before the American people and the world maybe than he did when he was Secretary
                    of State. It's an amazing performance he's turned in.</p>

                        figuring out how this is going to come out.</hi>
                </p>

                <p>STRAUSS: ...yes, and eventually settled that lawsuit. They paid us around
                    $700,000, $650,000 or $700,000, money we badly needed. Some people criticized me
                    for taking their money; some people criticized me for not getting more. Some
                    people thought it was good. I was frankly glad to get it behind us and move on
                    to something constructive, and I needed the money. I wanted to use it in that
                    campaign coming up. I guess I've answered the question you asked.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, I was Chairman then. I was elected Chairman in December '72, and we
                    pursued it, and we had good help. Joe Califano helped and Larry O'Brien helped
                    and Edward Bennett Williams helped. Everybody was interested in that.</p>

                <p>STRAUSS: Not in the investigation, although the interesting thing about it, I
                    learned my house was broken into. I think it was during that convention or when
                    the convention planning was going on.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the '72 Convention.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: It was, I think, while I was in Florida for the convention itself, or
                    during its planning. Florida is where we held the convention. It was shortly
                    prior to that there were stories in the paper Strauss was in Florida planning
                    the Convention and my home was broken into. I later learned, a year or so later,
                    as I recall, that it was the Watergate crowd that broke into our home in Dallas.
                    It was a strange burglary because Helen's jewelry drawer was pulled out and the
                    jewelry box was left on the floor and no jewelry taken. I always keep anywhere
                    from 20 to 100 one-dollar bills just to have at my home in Dallas just to give
                    to people who knock on the door and need a couple of bucks here and a couple
                    bucks there, and they left the money, so they weren't after money. We had
                    morphine or some drug, something, I remember in the medicine cabinethey weren't
                    after drugs; the police were telling me all this stuff - and they didn't take
                    any of that, so they said, “This is a strange robbery.” We had a wonderful black
                    woman who worked for us. Jeweldine Nelson was her name, and Jeweldine said, “Mr.
                    Strauss, I'll tell you who it was. It was them Watergate burglars.” I said,
                    “Jeweldine, don't say anything like that. That's crazy. It makes us sound dumb.
                    You can't blame everything on them.” I'll be damned if that's not what it turned
                    out to be. So Jeweldine had more sense then me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As Chairman of the Democratic Committee after losing big
                        to Nixon, but the Democratic Party still controlled Congress, what did you
                        set yourself out to do at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I set myself out to try to bring the Democratic Party back together. We
                    were split so many different ways. It was hard to put two Democrats in the same
                    room together without starting an argument.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's the old story: “I don't belong to any organized
                        party. I'm a Democrat.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: That's exactly right. So the first thing I did when I was elected
                    Chairman was fly to New York to see the very distinguished black Congresswoman,
                    Shirley Chisholm. I left Shirley Chisholm in New York after I saw her very
                    publicly, and I flew to Alabama and I saw George Wallace, and both trips were
                    well covered. And then I came back to Washington and I made a speech about we
                    were going to take this Democratic Party and put the pieces back together. The
                    press asked, “What are your goals?” and I said, “My goal is instead of trying to
                    deliver a candidate to the Party, my goal is to stay totally neutral and deliver
                    a party to whoever turns out to be the candidate,” and that's what we
                    accomplished, and Jimmy Carter made it easier. I thought we were going to have a
                    brokered convention.</p>

                <p>STRAUSS: Yes. About '74 or '75 I started talking with a very able political
                    fellow from Minnesota, Mike Berman - he's a very good politician and a very
                    nice, smart fellow. I said, “Mike, we're going to have a brokered convention
                    just as sure as Hell. This party's split and we have so many candidates out
                    there. I want you to help me figure out what kind of room we're going to put
                    together, what kind of crowd we're going to put together in a room and try to
                    bring this split party...</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: By agreement we decide, in a “smoke filled room” who's going to be our
                    nominee. If one of them had 25 percent and another one had 30% and another one
                    had 35%, you'd put them together and try to deliver a consensus out of that.
                    Those people who have delegates, let them choose how they're going to...</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: This was to be a smoke-filled room where we would put these various
                    elements together. At one time, I forget who the players were, but I thought we
                    were going to have a brokered convention. I thought that Scoop Jackson was going
                    to be strong and I thought that Hubert Humphrey was going to be strong and I
                    thought that Lloyd Bentsen would have some votes, and there a bunch of people,
                    and I thought, instead of going to a convention that tears itself apart, the
                    Democrats need to show they can get together.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to the '72 Convention.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Exactly, and so I was terrified of that, as were others, and the answer
                    to it: I talked to a lot of people on the Hill about my notion of how we would
                    handle a sharp division between two or three candidates neither of whom had a
                    majority and all of whom were stubborn and how we'd get them in a room and force
                    consensus among them who should be the top and who would have the second spot.
                    It didn't happen because Jimmy Carter, to everybody's surprise including mine,
                    won our nomination outright. When he did it, there was nobody left standing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: You remember prior to '76 we had a midterm convention in Kansas City.
                    You've probably forgotten that. The first two years of that four-year period
                    were devoted to preparing for a midterm convention, which we held in Kansas
                    City. It had a deadlock, terrible deadlock. I don't know whether I said earlier
                    I was a product of many different elements, but I was primarily a product of the
                    governors. The Democratic governors wanted a winner. I got to know them all well
                    when I was Treasurer, and they had confidence in me and I in them. They were my
                    power base, together with the Hill leadership.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Tape 3 Side 1 with Robert Strauss.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: The Democratic governors were my base; they were my power base, fellows
                    like Senator Wendell Ford, Dolph Briscoe and Governor Ruben Askew. Those were
                    the sort of governors who were great supporters of mine. Mayor Daley was a
                    strong supporter of mine and others like that. At that midterm convention when
                    we had a stalemate, I got the governors, called them all together in the back
                    room, and said, “We've got to figure a way out of this,” because the delegates
                    were hung up then over rules, delegate selection rules. You had labor insisting
                    on one thing, and you had the more liberal wing of the Party insisting on
                    something else. I told the governors they had to step forward now and show their
                    muscle and get us out of this. I'll never forget that they sent a couple of
                    governors - I forget which ones - and I sat in a room with those different
                    people, and we finally agreed on a compromise. It was what the governors thought
                    would make sense. I'll never forget that Mayor Daley had had a little stroke a
                    month or so before and he wasn't fully recovered but he came out to that
                    convention because he knew I needed him and he gave a damn. He'd gone to bed
                    already about 7 o'clock or 8 o'clock when we were winding this up, and I wanted
                    to notify him of what was going on and, frankly, I needed his support to pass
                    that on the floor. I got him on the phone and I said, “Mr. Mayor, we've got the
                    following agreement. It's not everything I want and it's not everything you
                    want.” He said, “Well, how do you feel about accepting it?” I said, “Mr. Mayor,
                    I feel like a second-story burglar who's robbing the house and he's got about
                    two-third of the jewels in his pocket and he hears the police sirens coming and
                    he has to decide whether to stay around another few minutes to try to get the
                    rest of the jewels or get his ass out of there, scamper down the ladder and get
                    off.” I want to take what we've got and get out of town. Mayor Daley laughed and
                    said, “Well, Bob, I'll tell you. If you feel that way about it, if you can live
                    with it, I'll come over and hold the ladder for you. Give me a half an hour to
                    get dressed.” He came over and he spoke to the delegates. He had a man, he
                    delivered a fellow - I think he was treasurer of his party in Illinois - and he
                    spoke, and that brought the Mayor's constituency in and we had the governors
                    working and we rammed it through that convention. As I said, it was about 65 or
                    75 percent or what I'd hoped for, but it was a compromise we could live
                    with.</p>

                        their fire. Many of them were young and later moved into the political
                        process. These were essentially quite young, dedicated people. They were

                <p>STRAUSS: Oh, no, it was still a real problem, and we had to run over them to some
                    extent. By the time the 1976 Convention was held in New York, we had rules that
                    we'd passed with the Executive Committee, and to tell you the truth, I had it so
                    tight by then that you couldn't hardly get a microphone to speak at that
                    convention. The Chairman's people, my people, approved it, and they used to say
                    that they had to get permission to ask to speak, and that's really about the
                    truth. We kept the fiery element on both sides, both left and right, from giving
                    this a repeat of earlier conventions.</p>

                <p>STRAUSS: Well, you had Al Barkin, who was political director of the AFL-CIO, and
                    he fell out with me early. He supported me for Chairman then because he wanted
                    to dominate the Executive Committee, and I couldn't let him do that. I gave him
                    so many seats and that was it. So he had no use for me, and stayed that way, I
                    might add, until his death. But he was difficult and somebody had to deal with
                    him, and it was me and I did. I was considered a strong Chairman; you couldn't
                    be a chairman of that party then unless you were strong. We had a large group of
                    supporters from the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, whether they were the
                    Carter people or Ann Wexler and Joe Duffey, who were prominent liberals, and
                    Averell Harriman, a distinguished liberal, a former governor, and any number of
                    people. So we had a lot of support from the liberal side, and we had a lot of
                    support from the more conservative element in the South, but we didn't have any
                    help from Labor. I always regretted that. But when we finally had a nominee,
                    Labor, of course wasn't crazy about Jimmy Carter. They wanted Scoop Jackson.
                    Well, I was a Scoop Jackson person in my heart. I couldn't show it anywhere, but
                    I certainly was. I had a close friend in that Presidential primary for a while,
                    Senator Lloyd Bentsen, who's one of my closest friends in Texas, and I basically
                    went into that whole year hoping for a Scoop Jackson presidency. I though we
                    could elect him President, and I think we could have. Jimmy Carter turned out to
                    be a much stronger candidate than I ever dreamed he would be. Carter and I had
                    no relationship much. He didn't care very much for me, and his people didn't
                    care for me too much - I think I may have mentioned this earlier - until they
                    got to the Convention, and when they got to the Convention, they saw that they
                    didn't understand the convention process. If it hadn't been for the Strauss
                    people, a fellow named Bob Keefe and Mark Siegel and people like that, Vera
                    Murray, that Convention would have fallen apart. Carter and Hamilton Jordan and
                    Jody Powell, who worked for Carter, and Charles Kirbo, who was Carter's primary
                    advisor, saw when they got there that there was a lot more to running a
                    convention than they had any idea. When we left there, I'd say Jimmy Carter had
                    respect for my skills and I had respect for his skills. Interestingly, while he
                    intended and had papers that he was going to get me out as Chairman and put some
                    long-time Carter person in as Chairman of the Democratic Party, before we left
                    the Convention, he said to me, “Bob, I'm counting on you staying on as Chairman
                    until after the election,” and I said, “Fine, I'd like to see it through.” Then
                    a few weeks later he asked if I'd serve as chairman of the campaign. Hamilton
                    Jordan and Jody Powell had more influence with him than I did even though I was
                    the chairman of the campaign, but we all worked together well and they're very
                    close friends now. I guess I'm as close to Jimmy Carter as anybody in the
                    country today.</p>

                        happened with other governors like Ronald Reagan and others - they come out
                        of the governorship and they have a coterie around them, usually very
                        dedicated, highly suspicious of everybody else, and then all of a sudden
                        they're in the big time. This must have been quite a problem, always is a

                <p>STRAUSS: Jimmy Carter ran as an outside, you'll remember, and the great mistake
                    he made was he wanted to stay an outsider. Ronald Reagan ran against Washington
                    as an outsider, but he had gotten his rear end warm on the seat and he said, “We
                    want to get to the inside; we want to be a part of the inside,” and the first
                    thing he did when he got here before he took office was have a big reception for
                    the insiders. He and his people started putting together a relationship with the
                    political insiders, and they did it. They took Jim Baker, who was active, as you
                    know, in his campaign and played a leading role in it. He said to me, “Strauss,
                    all we had to do was look and see everything that the Carter people did and do
                    just the opposite, because they had messed up the whole damn thing before they
                    took office. They had already offended people, like Tip O'Neill and others. They
                    started to offend them with tickets to the inauguration, and it never quit.</p>

                        Convention?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh, I was chairman of the Carter campaign for reelection.</p>
                <p>Q: What sort of things did you do? STRAUSS: Well, we planned the campaign across
                    the country, and we raised money for it. We had regular meeting of the top
                    campaign council, so to speak, Powell, Jordan, Kirbo, Bob Shrum, Pat Caddell,
                    Jerry Rafshoon and Strauss and several others. We had weekly or biweekly
                    meetings. We met with Labor and I'd go to New York and speak. I knew more people
                    around the country than they did, and I was of considerable value in that area.
                    Carter was not a great speaker, but he could get a group interested. He was very
                    sincere and he was persuasive in his own way. Carter knew, or he had seen that
                    my strong point was a great sense of humor, and I used to introduce him with
                    humor. I'd warm up the crowd. I'll never forget when he started out, we'd go to
                    places and I would be sitting next to him with a dozen or so people on the
                    stage. Then after I'd introduced him once or twice, when we'd get to the later
                    events, he frequently would say to the master of ceremonies or the mayor or the
                    governor, “Instead of having so-and-so do it, let Strauss introduce me,” and
                    then I would get up and say something like, “You know, I'm somewhat embarrassed
                    to be here with the candidate. One thing a campaign chairman knows to do is
                    never to dress better than the candidate. It's embarrassing. But,” I said, “try
                    as I might, I can't dress as bum as this candidate we have.” The crowd would
                    roar and they would clap, and Carter would love it and I'd like it. The whole
                    thing went well. It was a nice dog-and-pony show we put on. Then he'd get up and
                    make some cutting remark to me. So we played off each other very well. People
                    say that Jimmy Carter had no sense of humor and they were wrong.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the role - let's go back to even '72 - of Jesse
                        Jackson and the black element within the electorate of the Democratic
                        Party?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, we had a strong, active black woman on our Executive Committee. C.
                    Dolores Tucker was her name. She's still very active in politics generally and,
                    I'm sure, in black politics also. I don't know if she's a force anymore but she
                    was an active person, and we had a number of people like that. Shirley Chisholm
                    was a strong personality. We had good black support, and they were active. Jesse
                    Jackson was just coming on the scene. Now, in the '76 campaign, during '76 and
                    then in the '80 campaign, which we lost, Jackson played a prominent role. I
                    remember I had rented a Lear jet plane, and I said to Jesse, “Now, you've got to
                    take this plane and this last week you've got to cover three or four cities a
                    day. Call me every night and tell me where you are and where you spoke and what
                    you did.” He would sometimes call and sometimes he wouldn't, but he liked that
                    plane and he was good at it and he worked hard. He knew it was a good
                    opportunity for him.</p>

                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, he was then. I don't know that he was such a team player, but as
                    long as he had a big, visible role, he was very good, very bright, very
                    talented. He and I understood each other and got along well. He did his best for
                    the Democratic Party.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: We thought he was vulnerable, and we knew he was decent. I don't know
                    whether we talked about it or not, but I knew that Nixon had wanted to make John
                    Connally his Vice President. As a matter of fact, he wanted to eventually make
                    him President, but when he tried to sell him to the leadership of Congress, the
                    Republicans didn't want him and the Democrats didn't, and Nixon was shocked. I
                    told you this story.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, so I'll get off of that. When he asked who he should name to the
                    vacancy, I think it was Democratic Speaker Carl Albert who said, “You ought to
                    put Gerry Ford as Vice President. You're too weak; you can't confirm anybody
                    controversial like Connally.” They all agreed, Both Republicans and Democrats,
                    and that's how Gerry Ford got on the ticket.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: They had a big role with me because I was a product of the Democratic
                    Governors and Hill leadership. I was looked on by then as a Pol. The Hill
                    related to me. Mike Mansfield and I were friends. Bob Byrd was glad to see me. I
                    used my chairmanship to befriend these people all I could, and they in turn used
                    their power on the Hill to befriend me as Chairman, so it was a very good
                    relationship. I used the Congress as they like to be used. I was speaking in
                    places for them, and I sought their advice. I sometimes took it, sometimes
                    didn't, but we tried to help them out. We didn't have any money, but I traveled
                    all over this country speaking for them, the governors and the Senators and the
                    House members, in various districts and states. So I was an energetic Chairman
                    and a rather popular one. I raised a ton of money for the House and Senate
                    candidates during the '72 campaign.</p>

                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: No, they had priorities that were different, everybody had their own
                    priorities, but they did a pretty good job. We had peace during that '76
                    campaign. You know, when you're out of power, you learn to get along. When you
                    get that power, you begin to fall out.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, sure there was. Senators were there whether they had the White
                    House or not. There was a certain amount of patronage, and the same thing with
                    House members. As Chairman I had patronage; I could put people on important
                    committees where they'd have opportunities to make themselves visible in their
                    own states as they would want to get more involved in the political process. I
                    used patronage not as something evil, but it was just something good for the
                    party and the individuals.</p>

                <p>STRAUSS: Keep in mind that we had a black caucus in the Democratic Party, we had
                    a Hispanic caucus in the Democratic Party, we had these various caucuses. As a
                    matter of fact, I worried we were balkanizing the Party it too much, but they
                    all wanted their own root.</p>

                <p>STRAUSS: Oh, yes. I had a woman as my executive director when I was Chairman and
                    I had a vice chairman who was a black. He was from New York. I'll think of his
                    name in a minute. Anyway, if anything, we were too Balkanized. It later became

                    the young fellow who ran that, as I recall, is now very successful. He's built a
                    radio and television chain. He was a talented young man, and he ran our young
                    people's group. We had state chairmen in that association, and they were a power
                    block in the Democratic Party. And I got along with all of them, except I didn't
                    get along with people who ran the state chairman's association. I had trouble
                    with them, and I guess we each had a certain amount of distrust of the

                    wasn't too crazy about doing business with them. They had their agenda and I was
                    trying to rebuild a divided party..Q: We'll have to stop here, but we're talking

                    Could you tell me something about how Carter first appeared on the horizon for

                    Jimmy Carter. I made a pretty good speech, it was well received, and he was

                    good friend and who was one of his political mentors, told me at that time that

                    what way, and he said, “I'd be willing to chair a committee of yours to reelect
                    Democrats to Congressional seats across the country, and all the expense you
                    would have would be the expense of an aide for me and my travel expense.” I
                    said, “Well, that makes sense.” Carter was an energetic fellow and a good
                    organizer. He was not a great favorite of the other governors, but he and I got
                    along adequately, so I accepted that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why wasn't he a favorite of the other governors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: They thought he was looking after his own business more than the
                    Governors Association businesthat he was too ambitious. When the Democratic
                    governors would meet, he would always manage to excuse himself about three
                    minutes before the meeting ended and step out where the press was waiting for
                    all of them, and he would then have a private press conference before the others
                    got there, and they resented it and complained about it. I said, “Well, you have
                    to take care of your own business. I can't tell a Governor when he's going to
                    leave a meeting.” These were men who all later became good friends of his. I
                    guess they were friendly then, but they weren't crazy about him. They kind of
                    resented the conduct I just described. So he came to Washington, and I guess
                    this was about 1974. I had been elected Chairman in '72. So he came in early
                    '72, and we kind of hammered out a little deal. Bob Keefe, who was my assistant,
                    the DNC political director, made the first trip with Carter. Then Governor
                    Carter's early stop, if not his first stop, was Iowa. After Keefe spent a couple
                    of days on the road with him, he said to me, “Bob, this fellow is running for
                    President,” and I said, “Well, that's interesting, Keefe, because I never would
                    have dreamed it and I doubt that anyone is going to take him too seriously as a
                    Presidential candidate. I guess we don't need to worry about it. If he can
                    capitalize on helping the Democratic Party, we ought to be glad we're getting
                    that kind of help.” But it concerned me, and that's the first time it came to my
                    attention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would it concern you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, that they would think that I was playing favorites.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were sort of sponsoring his traveling around?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: He was traveling on behalf of the Democratic Party, and I was Chairman
                    of the Party and I had permitted him to have that role. I don't think anyone
                    objected to it at the time. No one took him seriously, including me, I might
                    add. I remember when the young man whom he suggested I hire to assist him, whose
                    name is Hamilton Jordan, who is one of the nicest fellows and one of the best
                    political operators I've ever known, much later said to me, “Bob, I want to tell
                    you that Jimmy's running for President,” and I said, “Of what?” But he pulled it
                    off. He did it in a way you couldn't do today. He had no money. They had enough
                    money to start a little campaign for themselves when he announced for the
                    Presidency. And there was space in between the states on dates of primaries, and
                    he would win a primary or run well in one, then he'd have a week or two off and
                    he'd raise enough money to get to the next state, and he would repeat that
                    process. All of a sudden it became easy for him to raise money, because he was a
                    very live candidate, and after New Hampshire he was a terribly live
                    candidate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the '76 campaign you were above the fray, but how did
                        you observe the line-up or the developing line-up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: When we first started, Scoop Jackson had so much support that I thought
                    we were going to nominate him, and that appealed to me a great deal. I was sort
                    of a Scoop Jackson Democrat, if the truth be known. I never advertised myself as
                    that after I got to be Chairman, of course. I thought if anybody upset him it
                    might be Hubert Humphrey who would get back into it. I guess that was the year
                    Muskie also tried for that nomination, and I though he had a very good chance of
                    getting it. I'm getting mixed up here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Muskie was earlier.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Muskie was earlier, yes, that's right. So it was Jackson and Humphrey
                    and several others including a very close friend of mine from Texas, a very able
                    fellow, Senator Lloyd Bentsen. I tried to discourage Lloyd Bentsen from seeking
                    the Presidency. I thought he was trying for it too early. He wasn't well enough
                    known, but he thought there was a chance and you take a shot when you get it,
                    and he was probably right, but his campaign didn't amount to too much compared
                    to his enormous talent. I thought then that after a little while we had so many
                    good candidates, I think I mentioned to you earlier that I thought we were going
                    to have a brokered convention. We talked about that. But it turned out Carter
                    just swept right on through, and well before the Convention he had it nailed
                    down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any concerns as a Democrat for how a Carter
                        Administration would operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: No, I really didn't. I assumed what we always assume, that if you're
                    good enough to get yourself elected President, you're good enough to put
                    together an administration that can survive two terms. That is not the rule
                    anymore obviously, and Carter proved it wasn't a rule in his case. But Carter
                    was a very bright man, a very able man, and a fine man and a very close friend
                    of mine to this very day, but when we went to the Convention - I think I
                    mentioned this earlier - the Carter people didn't have too much use for me. They
                    knew that Carter was not my favorite, and I don't think any of them thought I
                    cheated on them, because I didn't cheat and it was pretty obvious I ran it on
                    the square. And it was pretty obvious, whether I wanted to cheat or not, I
                    couldn't help stop him or start him. He had his own momentum and they had a very
                    well thought-through and tactical plan for capturing the nomination, and it
                    certainly worked. Now, when we got to the Convention was when I first made, I
                    think, an exceedingly positive impression on Carter, because, as I mentioned
                    earlier, they had no notion of how to conduct a convention and I did. I had
                    planned that Convention carefully and had everything fixed about as well as I
                    could, organized as well as I could and structured as well as I could to keep
                    every nut we had on the far left or far right from getting their hands on the
                    microphones and creating a bad image. I wanted to kind of control the message
                    that we sent out, and we controlled it very well. Carter left that Convention
                    with about a 30-point lead, so I knew we had a chance to beat President
                    Ford.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you view President Ford as it came up to the
                        election?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I was extremely fond of President Ford. I knew him not well but more
                    than casually, and I liked him and his wife very much, and they liked me and we
                    had a nice relationship. But I thought he was vulnerable. I had no strong
                    confidence that we could defeat him but I knew we had a real shot at it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As Chairman of the Democratic Committee, does somebody
                        there sit up at your level or something and say, “Okay, here's where our
                        weaknesses are; here's where our strengths are. Here's how we can attack.
                        This is what we have to defend”? Do you get into that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh, yes, we would have senior staff meetings that I would call at
                    regular intervals, and various people had various strengths. Some of them had
                    press strengths, others had issue strengths, others had political strengths and
                    knowledge around the country. Put them all together and it contributed a great
                    deal to my own knowledge. My political instincts were very good. I was just
                    laughing: I had lunch with Bob Keefe the other day, whom I hadn't seen in about
                    a year, six months or so anyway. He always used to call me Oz. Once I asked him,
                    “Where'd you get that crazy name Oz for me?” “Well,” he said, “I used to tell
                    people Strauss is the Wizard of Oz.” He sent a note back to Vera Murray, my
                    assistant, just the other day after we had lunch and said, “I sure enjoyed lunch
                    with the Oz.”</p>

                        problems that later seemed to dog him - correct me if you think I'm wrong -
                        an over attention to detail, almost a certain self-righteousness, a
                        certainty on things which can get into your way if you...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes. He made mistakes he didn't have to make. He had very good help with
                    Jody Powell and Hamilton Jordan, and he was good himself. He had good instincts.
                    But he caught a wave just perfectly to defeat a rather popular incumbent
                    President. When you've been only a moderately successful governor of a
                    moderately large-small, somewhere in the middle, state like Georgia and defeat a
                    sitting President who was not unpopular, it was a massive undertaking, and they
                    did it very well. If I had to pick two people today with political skills, even
                    though I never see them much anymore, Hamilton Jordan and Jody Powell would be
                    two of the first I would pick.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Jordan and Powell? Later they became sort
                        of isolated from Congress. Did you feel that there was much of a tie-in, an
                        understanding that, you know, you have the campaign to win and then you have
                        the next campaign which is to work with Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I didn't have an inkling, I had a certain knowledge that they were
                    making mistakes. They ran against Washington, just as Ronald Reagan did four
                    years later, but Ronald Reagan had enough sense the minute he got elected to
                    forget that foolishness. They kept it up, and Hamilton Jordan, with all his
                    skills, used to say, “If we end up with people like So-and-So and So-and-So in
                    this Cabinet, then I'll feel that our whole effort to capture the Presidency was
                    wasted, because we won't be able to get rid of the Washington crowd. So they
                    managed to get rid of a lot of the Washington crowd including themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much did you find that the Ford pardon of Nixon
                        played? This seemed to energize a lot of people. To me I thought it was a
                        great thing to get that damn thing out of the way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I thought President Ford made the right decision, and maybe he did, but
                    I also think that that pardon offended the nation much more than I thought it
                    would at the time it was done, and I thought it was the right thing to do also.
                    I don't think the public ever made up their mind whether it was a precooked deal
                    or not, and still probably hasn't to this day. The interesting thing in that,
                    Charles, is that Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford today are two very, very close
                    friends and stay in regular communication with each other. I never would have
                    anticipated that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the nomination, what happens to a Party
                        Chairman?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, normally he turns his card in and goes his way. Carter had
                    intended to get rid of me as soon as he was nominated, but when he left that
                    Convention, so his people told me, they saw that I had some political skills
                    they needed and some knowledge of people around the country and commanded a
                    certain respect and had credibility that they could use. So, much to my
                    surprise, Carter asked me to continue on as Chairman of the Party during the
                    campaign and to serve as chairman of the campaign. I think I mentioned earlier
                    to you I had the title of chairman of the campaign, and while I was deeply
                    involved in decision making as the chairman along with Powell and Jordan and
                    Carter himself and his wife and our pollster, Pat Caddell, and a fellow named
                    Charles Kirbo, Carter would listen to Jordan and Powell more than he would
                    listen to me, and correctly so. They had been with him all his political life
                    and got him to the White House, and he certainly didn't need to rely on them any
                    less. What they did do is include me in the decision-making, and I had a chance
                    to speak up. But when I expressed concerns about our relationship with the Hill,
                    they didn't take that very seriously. They put a very nice man in charge of
                    their Hill relationships who had been in charge of their state legislative
                    relationships back in Georgia. He was a very nice and very bright fellow, but
                    the Congress didn't think particularly highly of him. It was hard to represent
                    Jimmy Carter and Hamilton Jordan and Jody Powell in the Congress, because they
                    ignored the Congress to a great extent. That didn't mean that the President
                    didn't talk to Congressional representatives, Senators and Congressmen, with
                    some frequency, but they knew he didn't care much for them. The truth is that
                    Carter loved the substantive side of being President, but hated the political
                    side.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I had a high regard for Fritz Mondale, did then and do now. We had a lot
                    in common in the Carter Administration, because he understood why Carter was
                    making life more difficult for himself with the inability of his administration
                    to relate to the Hill. He and I spent many hours talking about it. I think well
                    of him, and I was pleased when he went to Japan. As a matter of fact, my
                    recollection is that I had thought he might go to Russia after I was there.
                    Fritz Mondale would make a good Senator. I don't know about Coleman; he may or
                    may not. I have nothing against him. He was a Democrat until a few years ago.

                    devoted than his staff was to Jimmy Carter. Did we have differences from time to
                    time? Of course, we did. I wouldn't call myself trying to serve as a mentor to
                    any of them, although I was a senior member. Part of the problem that Hamilton
                    and Powell had, they were so young that age difference hurt them in some
                    respects, I think. Kirbo had tremendous influence.</p>
                <p>Charles Kirbo was a lawyer from Georgia who had served as Jimmy Carter's lawyer
                    when he was seeking the governorship. As a matter of fact, earlier than that, I
                    think, he was counted out unfairly in a Senate race, and Charles Kirbo
                    represented him in court and successfully so. I think that Jimmy Carter had more
                    confidence in Charles Kirbo than he did in all the rest of us put together. His
                    problem was he too had a rather narrow vision. We used to say that Kirbo never
                    left Georgia. I don't think Kirbo had ever been to Europe, and he'd sit in on
                    foreign policy discussions. Those were typical of the problems of his
                    administration. I remember after the President had been in office about a year
                    and a half, I guess, and obviously having a great many troubles, I suggested to
                    Charlie Kirbo, who I knew had more influence with President Carter than I did or
                    anyone else, for that matter, as I said, I suggested to Kirbo that he come up to
                    Washington and I'd get together three or four people I thought were wise and
                    sophisticated and dedicated to the principles that Jimmy Carter espoused and
                    that the Democratic Party stood for. So I called them together. I think Clark
                    Clifford was one of them and Jim Rowe was another. These were old-time,
                    dedicated Democrat voices. Harry McPherson was another who was in that room.
                    They'd all served in Democratic administrations in various capacities and were
                    out practicing law. So I got them to come in when Kirbo came up, and I said to
                    them, “Fellows, you know as well as I know that President Carter's having lots
                    of problems. Give him your view of this administration and what they can do to
                    improve their operation somewhat.” And we spent about three hours talking about
                    it, and they were very constructive, and Kirbo listened very quietly. He was a
                    gentleman and he was bright. I thought we'd made real progress. I'd invited
                    Charlie and his wife - she was in town with him - to come to our house and have
                    a bite to eat for dinner and then we were all going to the Kennedy Center
                    together and sit in the President's box. So after the meeting was over, Kirbo
                    and I got into my car and were driving to my home to meet his wife and mine and
                    go to the Kennedy Center after we'd have a bite to eat. I said, “Well, Charlie,
                    what did you think of the meeting?” I thought it had gone very well and they'd
                    given him tough love, if you will, good advice, very frank and candid advice.
                    Kirbo said to me, “Bob, I think those boys” - they were each in their 60s or 70s
                    - “I think those boys are just unhappy because Jimmy didn't offer them no job.”
                    I said, “Kirbo, are you out of your goddamn mind? You couldn't get one of these
                    guys back into government for anything in the world. They've been in government
                    15 or 20 years apiece. They're trying to make a little money now.” But Kirbo
                    didn't see it. He thought I was dead wrong. I don't think he took a bit of the
                    advice they gave, and it was good advice.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the role of Rosalynn during the election, the
                        primaries and up through, as your observation, the election?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Rosalynn Carter, I suspect, had little use for me when we first started
                    working together, because I had opposed and in her mind I was for somebody other
                    than her husband during the primaries. That was their view of it. But I came to
                    be one of her greatest admirers and am to this day and speak to her often. She
                    was bright, she was a learner, she had all the right instincts, she's just a
                    marvelous woman. And I saw her grow from a little Atlanta more-or-less housewife
                    - and I don't say that in a deprecating way - into this strong, mature, forceful
                    woman whose mind and instincts were splendid, and we worked together closely and
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes I've gotten the flavor of Presidential wives,
                        particularly with Ronald Reagan's wife but others, that they get so
                        possessive of their husband that all their political instincts are to
                        preserve and resent bitterly any criticism of their husband rather than
                        using the criticism to play on, developing, changing and all. How did you
                        find Rosalynn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I think all these political wives are the same in that regard, and I
                    think my wife would be the same too. They're very defensive of their husbands.
                    You never know what's being said on the pillow. I remember one time during the
                    second campaign when we were running against Senator Kennedy - he had challenged
                    the President for renomination...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the primary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: ...in the primary - I remember that I had been out into Pennsylvania
                    campaigning, and a couple days later Rosalynn was out there. She came back and
                    called me - I was chairman of that reelection campaign also - to give me a
                    report on her trip to Pennsylvania, and then she said to me, “Bob, what damn
                    fool came out for so-and-so which turned off the steel people?” I said,
                    “Rosalynn, reach over and pat that fellow you're in bed with on the rear end and
                    ask him that question.” She said, “Oh, thank you.” She had a real sense of
                    humor. I called her the other morning about 7 o'clock. That's the morning he
                    received a call at 4:30 a.m. about his Nobel Prize. I called their home in
                    Plains, Georgia, about 7:15 or 7:30, and she answered the phone. I said,
                    “Rosalynn, is the ex-President in? May I speak to him?” She said, “Bob, he left
                    here an hour ago.” I said, not meaning to be disrespectful, “You mean to tell me
                    the little bastard got up and left the house at 6:30 on a morning like this to
                    run some errand?” She said, “Well, you know Jimmy. He's out doing something,”
                    and that was 6:30 or seven in the morning, and she giggled when she said it, and
                    then I was ashamed of myself for using that term talking about an ex-President:
                    “You mean that fool got up and left the house that early on the day he heard
                    about the Nobel Peace Prize.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, this whole oral history program we're working on
                        deals with foreign affairs. During the election of '76, how would you see
                        the role of foreign policy and the Carter people's knowledge and sensitivity
                        to foreign affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, I think, as you probably recall, Jimmy Carter had very limited
                    experience in foreign policy. He had joined the Council of Foreign Relations,
                    the Trilateral Commission, because he needed those credentials, and I'm sure he
                    was interested in it, but he had no background in foreign policy, but he had
                    Brzezinski and he had Cy Vance, who were his two mainstays in that area. Between
                    the two of them they gave different advice but they gave good advice. They
                    represented two different points of view, not only in the campaign talking to
                    him, but also after he got in office there was a great of difficulty between the
                    two of them, and Carter tolerated it. As a matter of fact, I suspect he rather
                    liked sipping from two different cups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you personally up to this period, because we
                        really haven't talked about it, feel about foreign affairs and interest in
                        and all this, or did this play much of a role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, it did play a role but not much of a role in the race against
                    Ford. Gerry Ford was not a foreign policy man when he was thrust into the
                    Presidency, although he had experience, to a great deal larger extent than the
                    then challenger, Governor Carter, and he did in that campaign, but I don't think
                    foreign policy played a major role, except you remember that President Ford made
                    that one major mistake.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: What he said was that Poland was never under control of the Communists.
                    He just drew a blank on that, and that came home to haunt him, came home to
                    haunt him terribly.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, I don't think there was that great a difference between them. The
                    truth of the matter is more than any election I can remember this was a race won
                    and lost on domestic economic issues. We were having difficulties in this
                    country, and I think that was the major part, 80 percent, of the issue and, of
                    course, President Ford suffered greatly because of the Nixon pardon, but it was
                    probably the right thing to do..</p>

                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: The truth of the matter is Henry Kissinger may be the brightest foreign
                    policy man personally by two to one I've ever been exposed to. It's simply
                    amazing when you stop and think that it's been over 30 years, I guess, since
                    Henry Kissinger was in office, or close to 30 years, and he, I think, is a
                    bigger figure in foreign policy issues in this country today than he was when he
                    was Secretary of State at the peak of his power. He's lasted better than anyone
                    I know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just wondering, during the '76 campaign and all, was
                        there any sort of spill- over from a very active time. People who look at
                        foreign policy look at Nixon and Kissinger, not just the opening to China
                        but other things, as being probably a period when we were the most cohesive
                        as far as administration looking at foreign policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I think that Richard Nixon possibly had the best thought-out. It may not
                    have been the most perfect, but he had a strategic sense of where this country
                    ought to go and how it ought to get there in its foreign policy, and he
                    articulated it well. I don't know of any President who really surpassed him and
                    if any were equal to him in that regard. You can like or dislike Richard Nixon,
                    but that was also his great strength and he served this country well in that
                    area in my judgment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this spill over, though? Was this at all an issue,
                        relations with, say, the Soviet Union during this election?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I don't think so. I don't have a recollection. I guess as a Democrat we
                    had to be on the defensive to show we were strong enough on foreign policy. If
                    you will recall, when George Bush was put on the ticket with Ronald Reagan,
                    there was some talk then that Kissinger was trying to get Gerry Ford back on
                    that ticket in the vice president's spot, and his strength in foreign policy was
                    considered the reason that that might make sense. But I don't recall that either
                    of those elections were won or lost on foreign policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During, again, the '76 campaign, looking at it sort of
                        from the strategic overview, any particular states or areas that gave you
                        particular concern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: It's hard to think of any that didn't give us concern. We couldn't take
                    anything for granted. But, strangely, you know, we left that Convention with a
                    30-point lead in the polls and we finished up by about one or two points. So
                    Jimmy Carter, as I say, caught the wave just right to get elected to the
                    Presidency, but even though he was a pretty good candidate, a fairly good
                    candidate, we went down constantly, every week saw us dropping in the polls. If
                    the thing had gone on another week or so, who knows, we may have lost.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a natural thing, or was there something about the
                        campaign or Carter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Carter was not a great candidate. He didn't like politics, and he was
                    not a great candidate. He was an adequate candidate, and I think that the fact
                    that he didn't like politics came through. People could tell that. That wasn't
                    his bag. He would have rather been sitting down working on an issue than out
                    campaigning, and it showed. Take this present President: George Bush loves
                    campaigning. He may act like he doesn't, but he likes being out with people. He
                    knows that's his strength. Jimmy Carter didn't care for that. It was a chore for
                    him. He wanted to work on the serious issues he saw facing this country and the
                    worlthe rest was just a waste of time in his mind. That's, of course, admirable,
                    but it doesn't get you re-elected.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, I was fairly well involved. The Hill had sources of strength for
                    me when I sought the chairmanship of the Party, and I stayed in close touch with
                    them. I used to kid and say it's very hard for Tip O'Neill or Mike Mansfield to
                    get out of their office to have a picture snapped without the Chairman of the
                    Party rushing over to get in with them, because that's the only thing I had
                    going for me. We didn't have a lot going for us then, the Democratic Party. We
                    turned it around, of course, with the Carter election, we thought, but it was
                    only for four years.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, Kirbo asked - I forget the job - he asked if I was interested in
                    being Secretary of Commerce, and then he said, “Would you be interested in HEW?”
                    - that's what it was called then. I said, “Charlie, I've been three years
                    Treasurer and four years Chairman. I'm interested in getting back to my law
                    firm.” And he said, “Well, you'd better hurry if you want a job. Everybody wants
                    a job. Don't you?” I said, “I do not. I want to go back to my law firm, and I'm
                    going there the day this thing's over. I'm going back to the law office as quick
                    as I can get out, not the day it's over, as soon as we get the inauguration
                    over.” I returned to my law firm and I had been there about three months when
                    Hamilton Jordan called me and said that the fellow that I had suggested, an
                    ex-Congressman named Green from Philadelphia. For some reason, that suggestion
                    didn't fly. Others had been suggested for Special Trade Representative, which
                    had been elevated to a Cabinet-level job under the new legislation, that job was
                    open and the President would like for me to take it. I said, “Well, let me think
                    about it.” I thought about it for a day or so, and I talked to a number of
                    people who thought I ought to go into the Administration if I could get that
                    particular job. It was Joe Kraft, who was a great columnist, who convinced me
                    more than anyone that it was a good job and I'd like it, I'd be good at it, and
                    it didn't have a big bureaucracy to deal with. That I could really get something
                    done, and we needed to get trade legislation negotiated and then passed. I took
                    the job, and it was in that time that we negotiated and passed the Tokyo Round,
                    known as the Trade Act of 1979.</p>

                <p>STRAUSS: To begin with, when I came to Washington I had already had some economic
                    success in Texas, and that's something I tell people all the time. These young
                    people want to talk about going into politics, and I tell them that's great but
                    do it as a part-time thing and get yourself a little economic stability and
                    security. You'll be a better public servant when you get there. You'll have a
                    sense of independence and you can do the things you truly believe in and not
                    worry about making a living, and you'll have economic security for your family.
                    So when I came to Washington, I had economic security for my family or I
                    wouldn't have come here. I left my law firm and they gave me, as I recall - in
                    those days you could get paid out over a period of time - they gave me two
                    years' pay, which is what I'd asked for, what I'd been earning, my pay as a
                    partner. We arrived at the sum, and they paid it out over a couple or three
                    years, which is the way I requested it, so that took care of that. Today you
                    can't do it quite that way; you have to act differently. Today is better public
                    policy than it was before. People object to the revolving door and, well, the
                    idea of people going from the private sector to government and government back
                    to private sector. I think I'm a product of going in and out of government a
                    couple times - in a Democratic administration and then later in a Republican
                    administration. I think it made me a better executive when I was in the
                    government and it made me a better lawyer when I got out of there. I see nothing
                    wrong with it. If a fellow's dishonest, he's going to be dishonest wherever he
                    is, and if a fellow's honest, he's going to be honest wherever he is and
                    straightforward, and I've never had any criticism of my integrity. Experience is
                    invaluable whether one is in government or the private sector.</p>

                        that you were with the Democratic Committee and up to the time you became
                        Special Trade Representative, did your law firm have any particular focus, a

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: It was a growing law firm and it was a corporate practice. We
                    represented business. We didn't represent Labor and we didn't represent
                    plaintiffs. We were a business corporate law firm and a successful one, and I
                    was very proud of it and we've continued it along that line. I've been blessed
                    with good partners and I've been blessed with a good career. I guess that's
                    about all I'd say about it.</p>

                        Democratic side.” One thinks of the corporate world as being more
                        Republican. Did they ever say, “Hey, what are you doing? or something like
                        that</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I founded my law firm, and they've never said no to me on anything. I
                    don't know whether it's being polite and respectful or because they're scared,
                    but they've been very supportive. Here I am, 84 years old, and when I went
                    downstairs Friday they had a new car for me. I guess they thought me and the car
                    were both getting a little old and at least they'd help with the car if they
                    couldn't help me. They've always been thoughtful and I've tried to
                    reciprocate.</p>

                <p>STRAUSS: I had talked to Charles Kirbo - he had talked to me, rather - about
                    whether or not I was interested in a job in the Carter Administration. Carter
                    had just won the election but not yet taken office. I told him no, I had been
                    away from my law firm seven years and I was very anxious to get back and needed
                    to get back for a number of reasons, including financial but primarily for other
                    interests as well. After Carter had been in office a couple of months, prior to
                    that Joe Kraft, who was a distinguished columnist, you will recall, had talked
                    to me about the Trade Representative job, and the truth of the matter is I had
                    paid no attention to the Trade Representative office nor had I paid any
                    particular attention to trade issues except as we came across them in our law
                    firm, and I didn't really handle them in the firm, others did. But Kraft kept
                    telling me it was the best job in the administration because you could
                    accomplish something. Trade was going to become more and more important, and you
                    didn't have to have a bureaucracy in that job. You could run the damn thing, and
                    he said, “Bob, it's made to order for you. You couldn't tolerate a bureaucracy
                    but you can handle the STR bureaucracy because you can run it with one hand tied
                    behind you,” which was an overstatement. Anyway, he had talked to me two or
                    three times and I had paid very little attention to him. One day Hamilton Jordan
                    called me and said, “Bob, the boss wants to talk to you about the Trade
                    Representative job. The fellow you've been pushing is not going to get it, and
                    others have dropped by the wayside. Carter's not satisfied, but he would be
                    satisfied with you, and he's made this choice.” I said, “Well, I'd like to talk
                    to him about it. You know, I've just been back in my law firm two or three
                    months.” I just had gone on the board of the Xerox Corporation and had done
                    other things getting ready to go back to my normal life. So I went over and
                    talked to President Carter, and he told me why he thought I ought to take it,
                    and he did the one thing that I asked him to do. I said, “Mr. President, I know
                    enough about the bureaucracy and I've looked at this enough to know that if that
                    Trade Representative is not going to be speaking for you and have your full
                    support, it's a lousy job.” I said, “It has Cabinet-rank level now, and if it's
                    going to be treated that way and I'll be your spokesman on trade, then I'll take
                    it. If not, I'd rather not, and I'll help you find somebody else.” He said, “I
                    will write a note to the members of the Cabinet today saying that you're coming
                    in promptly and that you're the spokesman on trade.” So I took the job, and he
                    wrote the note - I have a copy of it still in my files - in which he said,
                    “...will be my spokesman on the following issues and responsible for them,” and
                    he outlined Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, Special Trade
                    Representative, and a couple others in that memo. That's how I became Special
                    Trade Representative. I started trying to build a staff promptly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had there been a Special Trade Representative before, and
                        was there a staff in place?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes. You know, the Special Trade Representative's job was a legacy of
                    Cordell Hull when he was Secretary of State, but it never really had the kind of
                    muscle and authority that it needed, and a couple of people had failed to
                    accomplish what they had hoped for because the job didn't have any muscle behind
                    it. As a matter of fact my predecessor had entered into casual negotiations of
                    the Tokyo Round, and those negotiations were dead in the water. The big Trade
                    Office in Geneva, where a Deputy Special Trade Representative ran trade affairs
                    for Europe, was kiddingly referred to as a place to go if you want to ski in the
                    winter and water ski in the summer, because there's no work to be done and no
                    negotiation going on. Carter had said to me, “I want to start those trade
                    negotiations. The reason I want you to take this is not because you know the
                    trade issues, but because you're energetic and you're aggressive and you'll
                    pursue it vigorously, just as you did as party chairman.” So I got started, and
                    we started trying to light a fire and pursue an agenda vigorously. I had an
                    interesting thing happen to me. I had been in that office 10 days, not much more
                    than that anyway, and in that office we got intelligence briefings from the
                    intelligence agencies on what was going on, and they, of course, intercepted a
                    lot of international traffic, cable traffic and other things, wire traffic -
                    wireless traffic, I should say - and when the man briefed me one morning, (an
                    intelligence agent briefed me each morning at around 7:30), he said, “You know,
                    one of your men who is in charge of so-and-so” - he described who it was - just
                    said to his Japanese friends that they don't need to worry about this Trade
                    Representative; he doesn't know anything about the job, and he'll just be
                    another one who sits.” So I thanked him for the briefing, and the next morning I
                    had a staff meeting, senior staff meeting, and, while I was looking straight at
                    this fellow who had uttered that the day before, I said, “Now, I want to tell
                    you fellows something, every goddamn one of you. If there's any son of a bitch
                    in here that thinks that Bob Strauss isn't going to pursue this vigorously,
                    aggressively, and accomplish something, he's mistaken in his thinking and he
                    ought to quit now before he gets his ass fired. We've got all be in this
                    together or we're never going to pull this thing off. We've got to reinvigorate
                    the Tokyo Round negotiations with confidence and toughness. I'm tired of hearing
                    that the Europeans understand trade because they've been doing it for years and
                    we just don't have the background to compete with them.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Tokyo Round?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: The Tokyo Round was a round of trade negotiations between 99 countries
                    to adopt and bring up to date modern rules regulating international trade,
                    trying to reduce tariffs, non-tariff barriers and reduce obstacles to trade. The
                    Europeans were hesitant. The Japanese were negative on it; they didn't want any
                    changes and reform of the rules. The Europeans were worried about their common
                    agricultural policy which enabled them to protect their agricultural markets.
                    And there were a lot of people in this country that were negative on the Trade
                    Round. Textile industries, for example. They didn't want to get involved in open
                    trade. And there were many other constituencies who were opposed to it, and many
                    European constituencies. As I said, Japan was very timid. They didn't want to
                    step forward and do anything. Anyway, we got started in the negotiations, and I
                    made dozens of trips to Japan and to Europe. I spent a lot of time there. I had
                    a first-rate deputy, Alan Wolff, who was my domestic deputy. He's a very
                    respected trade lawyer right now in private practice, very able and very
                    successful, and a foreign deputy named Alonzo McDonald who had a distinguished
                    business career. He, too, was very good, and we made a good team. After a year,
                    a very bright trade lawyer with a Hill background joined us. It was a good team.
                    But anyway, that's how I got into the business of trade. We put trade front and
                    center. The press always liked me, and they gave me good press. People like
                    Elizabeth Drew did significant stories about the new Trade Representative busy
                    all over town and all over the world. Before long, our office was known in
                    Washington as a center of some power and the press, worldwide, was excellent
                    Carter had trouble with his people, not serious trouble, but the staff was not
                    structured well, and I was helpful in those ways. I was helpful to Hamilton
                    Jordan and Jody Powell, who were the two most important friends Carter had with
                    him. They came with him from Georgia. I became more and more important in the
                    Carter Administration, and I came to really enjoy my new job. I knew we had put
                    together a strong staff, and began to get confidence that we could have a fairly
                    successful negotiation and also saw the House and Senate begin to support
                    responsible reform legislation..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly Jordan was noted for not returning calls to
                        Congress and things like that. Of course, this was where Carter had a real
                        weakness, in his relations with Congress.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, he did. The truth of the matter is, Jimmy Carter, whom I'm devoted
                    to and was then, didn't like politics. He really didn't. He was good at it when
                    he worked on it a little bit, but he disliked it. I would encourage him to have
                    Senator Russell Long up and have him out on the Truman Balcony and serve him a
                    drink and then have dinner, and I said, “Somewhere along the way, he'll tell you
                    how to get your tax bill passed.”</p>

                <p>STRAUSS: He was Chairman of the Finance Committee in the Senate, and he was known
                    as a brilliant power in the Senate, or one of the most. There was Senator Abe
                    Ribicoff, Connecticut, who was also on the Finance Committee and who represented
                    that committee primarily in the trade area. He, too, was most helpful. As a
                    matter of fact, I remember I took Ribicoff and Long to Geneva, talked them into
                    going over there, and got our European staff, led by Alonzo McDonald, to put on
                    a real dog and pony show about the importance of what we were doing and the
                    progress we were making. Once those two Senators got on board, the job was a lot

                <p>STRAUSS: Then we had them working; by then they were working pretty good after I
                    came in. Anyway, we began and we concluded a successful negotiation. By the time
                    we finished that negotiation, it resulted in the Trade Act of 1979, and it was a
                    big step forward. Tariff barriers were reduced, and Europeans bought in when I
                    showed them we weren't trying to destroy their common agricultural policy. I
                    knew they weren't going to give it up; they couldn't do it. I just said, “We
                    just want to get our nose under the tent a little further. You've got to loosen
                    your restrictive trade policy in the agricultural field.” We all got along well.
                    The European negotiators like me and I liked them. They understood, as did we,
                    that you had to give something to get something in a trade negotiation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to talk a little about some of the details, if
                        you don't mind, about how you found working with the Europeans, to begin
                        with. In the first place, when you entered this - I think it was called the
                        European Community at that point - were we concerned and were you concerned
                        that this eventually was going to end up as a closed market, the European
                        thing, you know, when what is now known as the European Union really
                        coalesces?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: It was already closed to an extent. The purpose of the Tokyo Round was
                    not to stop it from closing but it was to open it more. It was partially closed
                    and trade was impeded by too many restrictions, too many anti-free and protected
                    trade countries and anti-free trade regulations and other barriers. So that's
                    what we were trying to do, open it up, open trade up, and we didn't do anywhere
                    near everything that needed to be done. After all, there have been two or three
                    Trade Rounds since then and they still have a great deal to do. But what
                    happened to me along the way is I became a fellow that President Carter looked
                    to for a lot of things other than trade. Helmut Schmidt was then Chancellor of
                    Germany, and the Germans were always very interested in trade and supported the
                    Tokyo Round. He and I became very good friends. He'd come to this country, and
                    he'd go to Blair House to visit the President. The Secretary of State would
                    greet him when he arrived. They'd take him to the Blair House, where he'd stay
                    two or three days. After he'd get settled in, about nine or 10 o'clock at night,
                    after he'd arrived, he'd call and ask if I'd come down and eat a bite with him
                    because he was hungry. We would talk about it, and he would help me a great deal
                    in working with the Europeans. These names all escape me; I haven't thought of
                    them in so long. I had exceedingly cordial relationship, close relationships,
                    with the trade representative of Europe, and that was a great help to me. A
                    distinguished Japanese diplomat named Ushiba represented the Japanese, and he
                    and I became friendly. He would bring his wife here, and my wife and I would
                    entertain them and we would spend time together and we'd talk about these
                    issues. We would return the visit to Japan. In those days we were trying to get,
                    among other things, beef into Japan. It was almost impossible. I well remember
                    on an early trip over there I took 12 sirloin strips, packed them - they were
                    frozen - and Ushiba had a big press conference when I arrived. He was stunned as
                    I got up to speak at the press conference and I handed him this box and I said,
                    “Mr. Ambassador, Ambassador Ushiba” - he'd been the Japanese ambassador to this
                    country also - “here's a nice package. I want you to open it and let the press
                    see what it is.” He opened this package and was surprised to see a dozen
                    beautiful sirloin strips. I said, “I brought you that beef because I think
                    that's the only damn way I'm ever going to get any beef in Japan, the way you're
                    turning me down on these issues.” Everybody laughed, and he got a kick out of it
                    too.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to Helmut Schmidt, from what I've talked to other
                        people, Helmut Schmidt after a bit of time became very disenchanted and
                        could hardly stand President Carter. Carter had pulled the rug out from
                        under him particularly on the neutron bomb issue and things like that. Did
                        you find yourself playing a role between the two men?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, I'd like to say that I did, but I really didn't because it was
                    impossible to play a role between them. In the first place, you couldn't
                    influence Carter and you couldn't influence Schmidt. They each played their hand
                    out the way they saw it. But the fact that I had a good relationship with Helmut
                    Schmidt was very important to me in my job, and it was helpful. By the way,
                    Cyrus Vance, our Secretary of State, also had a good relationship with Helmut
                    Schmidt, so I wasn't the only one that did. I don't think Carter disliked
                    Helmut; I think it was the other way around.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Schmidt really had little use for Carter. He didn't think he understood
                    the world as he should and didn't think he was experienced and deep enough. They
                    just didn't communicate very well with each other, although they were both
                    highly intelligent and each decent and dedicated. That was just a fact of
                    life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with the French? The French are
                        always the burr under the saddle in so many instances of negotiation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: The French were impossible in this negotiation. Giscard d'Estaing was
                    the head of that government at that time, and he was of little or no help. I
                    forget where we were, whether the meeting was in Europe or in this country,
                    maybe it was in Canada, but I had this agreement which we had worked our heart
                    out on and I thought everyone would agree on it, but I couldn't get the French
                    to move. Carter was there with me, and, in fact, he was at a meeting of the
                    heads of government and I was the only non-head of government in there. Carter
                    took me to explain the trade act that we wanted to present to the Congress and
                    wanted everybody to sign off on. We had everybody but couldn't get the Europeans
                    because the French were holding out. I'll never forget that I said to the group,
                    “And I'll tell you, this is a damn first-rate balanced agreement. Every nation
                    in the world can be proud of it.” Giscard said, “Mr. Ambassador, do you think
                    it's appropriate for one to speak so well of one's own accomplishment?” And I
                    said to him, “Mr. President, we used to have a baseball player in this country,
                    a pitcher named Dizzy Dean, and he once pitched two no-hit games in a row and he
                    was bragging about his accomplishment, boasting of his accomplishment, and
                    someone said, 'Dizzy, is it good taste for you to be bragging about yourself?'
                    and Dizzy Dean said, 'It ain't bragging if you done it.'" And I said to the
                    president, “And I guess I'll say the same thing to you. It is not boastful if we
                    did it, and I did.” Everyone caught it and they all laughed heartily, but
                    Giscard d'Estaing didn't understand that joke, didn't get it, and he leaned over
                    and said in French to the Canadian Prime Minister, “What's that about?” and the
                    Canadian Prime Minister said, “Giscard, if you didn't hear it in English from
                    Strauss, you won't get it if I give it to you in French.” I'll never forget
                    that.</p>

                        the American position first and all this. I take it this wasn't your

                <p>STRAUSS: I don't believe that's true. The truth of the matter is our Trade
                    Representatives, especially including me, were not nearly as experienced in the
                    field of trade as the European representatives, who were usually lifetime public
                    servants who had spent their entire careers dealing with trade issues. We
                    invariably had political appointees in the job, and most of them were like me
                    and couldn't spell trade when they took the job. No, I don't think the Europeans
                    thought that. I guess they may have thought we were arrogant in our demands. I
                    just don't think that's been true of Trade Representatives that I've known.</p>

                        but, as a matter of fact, they're usually part of a bureaucracy and usually
                        unable to be flexible and move and all that.</hi>

                <p>[END TAPE 3 SIDE B]</p>
                <p>This is Tape 4 Side 1 with Robert Strauss.</p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I think that many of the people on my staff had spent much of their
                    lives in trade issues, while I had had no experience at it and had to learn
                    everything. I used to get up every morning at 5:30 and study for an hour and a
                    half before getting dressed to go in the office so I'd be up to date on the
                    things I needed to talk about or be informed on the things I needed to talk
                    about that day; I'd read briefing papers. Alan Wolff was as good a trade fellow
                    as there was in the country, and he put helped me put it together. He took the
                    lead in telling me who he thought ought to do this job, that job and the other
                    one, and they had a pretty good staff when I got there. Bringing in Alan Wolff
                    was a great step forward, and getting him as my deputy was a vital step for me
                    and this country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I took him to lunch and talked him into taking it. He wanted the
                    European job; he wanted to be the deputy in Geneva. I said, “Hell, no, I need
                    you right here. I can't make it without a fellow like you.” He and I hadn't
                    known each, but I checked his reputation carefully, and I liked him. We are
                    still very good friends to this day. He is still one of the best trade lawyers
                    in the world, and I never was and never intended to be. That's just a fact of
                    life. But you don't have to be an expert on the issues and you don't have to
                    know all the nuances of trade legislation if you have the right kind of staff.
                    You give leadership, and I was always a pretty good leader and I was always a
                    strong negotiator.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find, during the time you were doing this, the
                        State Department and the Treasury Department? They had each had part of this
                        action, and bureaucracy is a problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: That is an excellent question. To begin with, Carter always worried that
                    I was going to give up too much, that I was not going to be aggressive enough in
                    pursuing an open trade policy, that I would settle for less, that on a scale of
                    one to 100, if the trade barriers were 70, he thought they ought to come to zero
                    and I would sell out if we got them halfway down. That always worried him. The
                    State Department's representative, the Under Secretary of Economic Affairs, was
                    named Richard Cooper. Cooper was a very bright, scholarly man from Harvard. He's
                    still there teaching, as a matter of fact, or was the last time I heard from him
                    some years ago. He's probably retired now. But Carter thought Richard Cooper was
                    totally honest, and he thought I would sell him on something that he shouldn't
                    be sold. We were good enough friends that I could kid him about it and he could
                    kid me about it. I used to say, “Well, let's get Richard Cooper over here,” and
                    before we'd get him over there, I'd get Cooper, get my hands on him, and I'd
                    describe my problems and describe where Carter was, and I'd say, “Now, Cooper, I
                    need you to come in there and sit by me and, when we're discussing this, nod and
                    say, “Mr. President, Strauss is exactly right.” Whatever Cooper said Carter took
                    as gospel, and Cooper was gracious enough about working with me very
                    constructively and had a lot to do with our success. The same thing with a
                    fellow who now has a think tank here, a trade think tank, who represented
                    Treasury, was also very helpful, although they would normally be more liberal on
                    trade issues than I could afford to be. I had to give to get. We had too many
                    constituencies that we had to satisfy. We had shoe manufacturers and we had
                    steel manufacturers, agricultural interests and textile manufacturers - you know
                    all those various constituencies - so it was give some here and take some there.
                    We had to find something to give up. I gave up on some alcohol issues to the
                    French. That's what got the French engaged. We had to buy their support by
                    giving them something. You can't just take from them; you have to give
                    something.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How attuned was President Carter to not so much trade
                        issues but the politics of trade issues? He came from Georgia, which is one
                        of the Southern states and one always thinks of textiles.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Carter was far removed from his background. He was a purist almost on
                    the free trade issues and is to this day. He was always worried that I was not
                    tough enough. “Toughen up, Strauss, don't give in to protectionist forces.” As I
                    was completing the trade negotiation, several things happened. The first thing
                    that happened was that President Carter called me the night we signed the final
                    agreement in Geneva. He called me in Geneva and told me that he needed an
                    inflation czar. I said, “Hell, I don't know anything about inflation, Mr.
                    President.” He said, “Well, you have to get started. You just need to take this
                    job for three or four months till Alfred Kahn,” who was Chairman of the FTC -
                    till he could get him freed from that. So I had to come back and be named
                    Inflation Czar. It was embarrassing and it was almost a fiasco, but at least we
                    made a noise about trade and made it sound like we were doing more than we were
                    actually doing. I got a fellow named Lee Kling from Saint Louis to come in and
                    run that office for me as deputy. So I did that. Then the President asked me to
                    take over the Middle East Peace negotiations. While that was going on, a few
                    months later Hamilton Jordan called for the President, as I recall, and said,
                    “You've got to work your way out of these things. You've got to come in here and
                    take over our campaign.” That's when Teddy Kennedy took him on in the primary.
                    He said, “You've got to come back. How quick can you get over there?” He said,
                    “You've wound up the trade negotiations.” I said, “Well, we haven't got it
                    through Congress yet. We're just about through.” “How soon can you finish it?
                    How much time before you can you do this, that and the other?” So I ended up
                    juggling two or three of those jobs at the same time. I began to think I was
                    really important. My name was in the paper constantly, but it wasn't always for
                    successes. There were successes and failures.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to go to one other side that we haven't talked
                        about. I've just come back from Tokyo, where they're talking about doing an
                        oral history there. Can we talk about dealing with Japan during your time,
                        because that's always been a real bone of contention?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Dealing with the Japanese was very difficult, very difficult. The
                    Japanese never take the lead in anything. They're timid, they're quiet, they sit
                    back. If you've got six nations involved, they'd be the sixth to sign on if
                    everything is settled. They have the most protective society, as you know,
                    economic society around than any major country, and I found it very difficult. I
                    was very fortunate in that Fukuda was Prime Minister then and he had a deputy,
                    really his administrative assistant, that he relied on for everything, who was a
                    man who now is father of the princess who married the crown prince. She was in
                    school here at Harvard at that time, and I came to know her through her father
                    and mother. He was very helpful and Fukuda was very helpful to me. The Japanese
                    were difficult to deal with, but it was always constructive because our personal
                    relationships were so good. That's always been a strength of mine, personal
                    relationships. Some people say, “You can't personalize too much.” I'm really one
                    of the ones they criticize, but it has worked for me. It worked in Washington,
                    in Japan, in Europe and it certainly did in Russia, with both Gorbachev and
                    Yeltsin.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you prepare for a negotiation round with the
                        Japanese, for example?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, it depends on what issue we were going to take up that meeting. I
                    remember the first trip I made to Japan. I guess I'd been in office maybe six
                    weeks, and then I went over there with four or five members of staff, and we had
                    our first big negotiation. I guess I'd been in office four months. About the
                    second day or third day, I told my people, I said, “Tomorrow at noon we're going
                    to get out of here and go home. Everybody be packed up, because I want to march
                    out of here.” They said, “What do you mean?” I said, “We're not going to make
                    any progress today, and I want to begin tomorrow morning by saying, 'If we don't
                    make some progress by noon, I'm going to take my crowd and go catch a plane back
                    to the U.S. There's no point in wasting time here in this negotiation.'" Sure
                    enough, we started off down the same tortuous road the next morning and we spent
                    about three hours and made no progress. I said to my assistant who was with me,
                    “Tell them to pack up and bring their luggage downstairs. Have the cars ready.
                    We're going to the airport.” We had the reservations already made. About a
                    quarter till 12 I said, “Well, I told you gentlemen that if we didn't make
                    progress there's no point in my keeping the staff over here. We have too many
                    things to do other places in the world. We're going to get out of here. We
                    haven't made any progress. We appreciate your time and your effort, but we can't
                    negotiate this. This is no negotiation. There's no point in wasting any more
                    time with you,” and I got up - they were stunned - and walked out. People
                    brought their bags down. We got the couple cars we had, and the six of us left.
                    Well, we hadn't been back in this country 24 hours when the phone rang and they
                    wanted to know, “Could we meet now in the U.S. and take up again this
                    negotiation?” Those may have been just negotiating ploys, but we had to get
                    their attention and let them know that we were serious about this, and we did
                    with some modest success. The Tokyo Round has been written about consistently as
                    a very successful round of trade negotiations insofar as the world was concerned
                    and insofar as this country was concerned. We got a lot, and we gave up
                    some.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I interviewed - I don't know if you know her - Marge
                        Searing, who was working with the Department of Commerce and the Special
                        Trade Representative. This was much later. But she was saying that when she
                        went to Japan for negotiations, she found the Japanese who worked for our
                        embassy in Tokyo invaluable, because they were both on our team and they
                        could tell people who was doing what and could give very good directions.

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I wouldn't have had that experience. My people may have, my negotiators.
                    My people who had the same job as she had may have done that, but it wouldn't
                    have been anything I would have done or had the time to do.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Coming back to Jimmy Carter, I've talked to people who've
                        worked with him and said he was a man who obviously paid great attention to
                        detail. He'd listen to people, but once he made up his mind, that was it.
                        He'd listen, and even if everybody would say, “Don't do this,” he would go
                        ahead and do it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, Jimmy Carter marched to his own drummer, still does - there's no
                    question about that - but he never failed to give me a hearing on everything. He
                    and I became close friends during his administration and are to this day close
                    friends, better friends now than we were then. Everyone knew that I could get
                    away with humor with Jimmy Carter when no one else could. As a matter of fact,
                    when Jimmy Carter and I would travel around - I may have said this earlier - he
                    would frequently tell the host, “Have Strauss introduce me at this meeting,”
                    because I'd do it with humor and kid him, and he needed somebody to warm the
                    crowd up and get him warmer. I think I mentioned that earlier. I must confess
                    I'm not objective about Jimmy Carter. I know he can be a pain in the ass,
                    because I've seen him. He knows he can be a pain in the ass, and so does
                    Rosalynn and the people who work with him. But he also is smart and he's bright
                    and he gives a damn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But his administration made a difference.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh, I think it did. Probably more than he gets credit for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No doubt about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I saw a television show about Carter for four hours just last week. It
                    was an achievement program. It was pretty good, but it didn't give him as much
                    credit as he deserves with the positive things his administration accomplished,
                    and it exaggerated the negative things, and there were a lot of negative things
                    about the Carter Administration. Jimmy Carter was not an A-plus President.
                    There's no question about thaone can be an A+ person and not be an A+ President.
                    . Q: What about the Special Trade dealing with Congress? You've got the Tokyo
                    Round, but then the real negotiation was, in a way, with Congress, wasn't
                    it?</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, and I stayed in touch with Congress throughout the two and a half
                    year process. A week never went by that I didn't go by and see the chairmen of
                    the various committees that were involved in supervising our worthe oversight
                    committees. That was my strength, the Congress. I had been Treasurer and then
                    Chairman of the Democratic Party, and I worked with Republicans and Democrats
                    alike. Everyone knew, when Carter put me in there, one of the reasons was I
                    could deal with Congress. So my relationship with the Congress was very good,
                    and I had Ribicoff on the Senate side and Russell Long as well. As a matter of
                    fact, when Carter asked me to take this trade job, after we had discussed it for
                    10 to 15 minutes, I said, “Well, I'll let you know tomorrow, Mr. President. I'm
                    just not ready to accept today.” And he said, “I'd like to get it off my desk.”
                    I said, “Well, I can't do it today. I have to think about it and talk to my wife
                    about it. I have to talk to my partners. I just rejoined my law firm a couple of
                    months ago.” After all, this was in April, I think, and Carter's inauguration
                    was in January. So that night I was home, and Russell Long, Senator Long, and
                    Senator Abe Ribicoff were having dinner together at Senator Ribicoff's home. The
                    phone rang in my apartment, and it was Ribicoff and Long on the phone, and
                    Ribicoff said to me, “I hear you turned down Carter today for the trade job. We
                    told him you're the man to get, and you turned him down.” I said, “Well, that's
                    not right. I told him I had to think about it.” He said, “Have you thought about
                    it?” I said, “Well, I've been thinking about it, but I'll decide in the next 24
                    hours,” and Russell Long said, “Now, Bob, wouldn't you like to be a real hero?”
                    I said, “Russell, I sure would.” He said, “Well, I'll tell you what you do. Take
                    this trade job, and me and Abe will see that you get the Senate behind you and
                    we'll see you get everything you need, and you'll get out of here and be a real
                    hero. This administration's going to need a hero, and you'll be it.” He said,
                    “On the other hand, if you don't take it, we're going to run your ass out of
                    town.” I laughed and said, “Well now, Russell, you explained it much better than
                    Carter did today when he asked me to take it.” I've never forgotten that
                    wonderful conversation with those two wonderful Senators.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, they meant something but not a great deal. Carter had them with
                    some regularity. There were more important positions represented there than the
                    trade job: the Secretary of State obviously and the Secretary of Defense for
                    two. It's sort of immodest to say it but that trade office that I ran became a
                    very important part of the Carter Administration, a very visible part, and the
                    press was extremely kind to me. I really never had bad presmuch better than I
                    deserved probably.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I always dealt openly with the press, never misled them, never lied to
                    them, always returned their phone calls. One time a very important columnist in
                    this country said to me, “You know, Strauss, I called you last Wednesday and you
                    called me from your car Wednesday night on the way home at nine o'clock. I was
                    already home and you were in your car just going home and hadn't had supper yet,
                    and you returned my phone call.” I said, “Well, that's why I returned it. I
                    hadn't had time all day, and I didn't want to leave one of your calls
                    unreturned.” He said, “You know, two days later I left the same call for
                    So-and-So” - I don't recall his nam“and he hasn't returned it yet.” Then he said
                    to me, “And who do you think I'm going to screw in the next column, you or
                    him?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the press, over your career but particularly
                        at this point, was sort of a vital tool?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, the press has been overly generous to me. That's what you have to
                    know. You won't find a negative story on me. I don't recall but one negative
                    story the whole time, a real negative story, and that was written by a fellow I
                    never met to this day. He worked for the Washington Post, and then he went to
                    Slate Magazine. Michael Kinsley, that was his name, Michael Kinsley. I remember
                    he wrote a mean-spirited article about me. I must have gotten copies of 50 or 60
                    letters people wrote to the paper objecting to it, and they ran a whole page of
                    letters objecting to that column. But the press was gracious and kind to me,
                    overly generous, and I was always good to the press. I worked with them hard. I
                    gave a chili party every year just for the press. We didn't have any help there,
                    and Helen and I would serve it and I'd make the chili myself, and we'd have a
                    hell of a good time. We knew the press as good friends. We had a social
                    relationship as well as a professional one.</p>

                <p>STRAUSS: It was a vital part of the Washington scene. Carter never fully
                    understood that. He never was willing to work the press. I enjoyed it..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned you were brought in to work on the primary

                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, Carter was President then trying to get the nomination for
                    reelection. It was my thought we could win it when we went in. People were
                    saying Kennedy would knock off Carter because Carter was so unpopular then and
                    his administration had not been a popular administration, as you recall. I had
                    some differences with him when I came in as chairman of the campaign. Carter
                    didn't want to debate Kennedy, and I wanted him to debate him and get it out of
                    the way. I said, “Let's do it early and get it out of the way, so if we lose it,
                    it will be all right.” It was not a strength of Carter's, a debate, as was later
                    proved with Reagan. You know, he lost that Reagan debate, and that's when he
                    lost the election, as much as any other thing. I worked hard in that
                    primary.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I suspect that Ted Kennedy didn't totally trust me because I was a
                    Carter person and he was on the other side, so there was no reason for him to,
                    but I always had a good personal relationship with Ted Kennedy. I do now and I
                    did then. After all, I knew his brother. I was in Dallas when his brother was
                    killed. But I thought Kennedy's primary campaign against Carter weakened Carter
                    a great deal going into the general election. It split off support from the
                    liberal wing of the party. They had no enthusiasm for Carter. They might have
                    had if he hadn't had to defeat Ted Kennedy to get there.</p>

                        addressed the nation with sort of a sour note about the great malaise? Could
                        you explain what your impression of this whole thing was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I thought it was a disaster. I thought that whole thing of him asking
                    for the resignations of members of his Cabinet and then reengaging some of them
                    and not the others was a public relations disaster. I thought the malaise speech
                    sounded like he wanted to blame it on something wrong with the American people,
                    the reason we were having trouble and he was, when it was really his
                    administration that was having trouble, not the American people. But you
                    couldn't control that sort of thing. I don't think Jody Powell or Jerry
                    Rafshoon, who were his primary people in that area, could control it. It did not
                    go well. My recollection is that Pat Caddell, a bright, talented fellow had a
                    good deal to do with the speech.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel it was self-generated from Carter? What was
                        bringing this about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, to begin with, it didn't make sense politically. I had little or
                    nothing to do with the public side of the President and there wasn't anything
                    you could do. I think what brought it out is the press exaggerated the negative
                    side of Carter. They turned sour on his Presidency and it was easy to magnify
                    his failing and minimize what he stood for. It was easy to do. He was his own
                    worst enemy. Remember the killer rabbit story?</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, the rabbit swimming towards his canoe, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: And he killed him. It was a crazy story. Where that came from I'll never
                    know. Those sorts of things haunted him, and then, of course, you know, he had
                    the Iranian situation that he was just distraught over, and then he got advice,
                    after holding off a year, to plan an effort to break them out of there but they
                    didn't plan properly, didn't have sufficient helicopters, didn't go in with
                    enough support to get it done. And that made him look terriblterrible planning,
                    terrible execution and a terrible result. I've never seen a man look any worse
                    than Jimmy Carter looked the day that he got that news with respect to what had
                    happened in the desert. It left the White House looking as terrible as the
                    result, and the President never recovered from it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, there was the problem of gas and all this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: We had gas lines at that time. You were talking about doing other things
                    I was asked to undertake. He had also asked me to take over the Middle East
                    negotiations, you recall. After Camp David he had told Sadat and Begin that the
                    three of them would remain a committee of three to implement the Camp David
                    Accords to the extent they could. Well, Carter found out three weeks later that
                    he couldn't devote enough of his time to that responsibility. His phone was
                    ringing and he spent all his time talking to them. He couldn't be President and
                    do that. He asked if Sadat and Begin would accept me in his place, and they said
                    yes. So I went to the Middle East as the replacement for Carter. While I was
                    doing that, we had a gasoline shortage and long gas lines with the election
                    coming up, and Carter sent me over to Saudi Arabia to talk to them about trying
                    to get more oil from them. I'll never forget, we had an ambassador over there
                    who was from South Carolina, former Governor John West, who had done all the
                    work on getting...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: West, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, John West.</p>

                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, and he was a very good man. He had really set the crown prince up.
                    It was sort of like it is today. The crown prince is now the acting king because
                    the king is ill. The then king was too ill, and the then crown prince saw me and
                    we spent about four hours together, from 10 at night till two in the morning,
                    which is when the Saudis like to negotiate, and he finally gave me 500,000
                    barrels a day for six months. That was a big story back here: “Strauss Brings
                    Back Half a Million Barrels a Day.” Those things were all good for the
                    President, the country and me. John West deserved the credit, but I got it. The
                    more I'd say John West did this, the more they'd say Strauss did it.</p>

                        mentioned you wanted to talk a bit about your family, and I would encourage

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Helen and I were, as I may have mentioned earlier, in Acapulco with
                    Governor and Mrs. Connally when Hubert Humphrey called and asked if I would be
                    interested in being Chairman of the Democratic Party. The Chairman had just
                    given notice that he was not going to be able to continue; he was failing
                    badly.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: A Senator from OklahomFred Harris. Well, I said no, I would not be
                    interested in being Chairman, I didn't know enough about national politics. I
                    said I would be interested in maybe being Treasurer or something I could do two
                    or three days a week a couple of weeks each month, be away from my family and my
                    law practice. He said, “Anyway you want to do it, but I want you involved. I'm
                    sorry you won't consider the chairmanship.” I said, “I would consider being
                    Treasurer if I had not a veto but input into who was going to be Chairman,
                    almost a veto, because I don't want to be Treasurer unless I have the confidence
                    of the Chairman that I would have absolute control over spending. That I didn't
                    want to be a part of a national committee with no credibility..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in 1968.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Humphrey's pick for Chairman had failed miserably and Hubert had been
                    defeated a year earlier, and the Party was rudderless, and he was looking
                    around. Democrats were critical of him for not doing something about taking the
                    lead, and so he needed to find a Chairman. I had done well and we'd carried
                    Texas, as we've discussed earlier, so I was one of the logical people for him to
                    look to. I just didn't know enough nor did I have enough time. Anyway, after we
                    finished talking, Humphrey and I agreed that I would be Treasurer on the terms I
                    mentioned. I then discussed it with my wife. Now, Helen was a young woman who
                    had no interest in politics when I married her. She was interested in art and in
                    music and in being a housewife, a mother. I liked that, but I also had in mind a
                    broader career than just practicing law in Dallas. When I discussed it with her,
                    as we did throughout our marriage, she said, “What you want to do is what I want
                    to do. Our children are older now, and I can be gone when I need to be.” As I
                    recall, my daughter Susan, who was the youngest of the three, was in college or
                    just out of college, I think in college. So that really leads me to say that
                    I've been very blessed I have a family that's very supportive and very
                    functional. There is nothing dysfunctional about my family. If anything, we're
                    too functional. We love each other. We're in touch over and over and over.
                    Whenever the phone rings at night, I know it's one of the children calling to
                    see how we are, and they have the same trouble with me calling to see how they
                    are. We talk almost daily. The same thing is true of our larger family. I have a
                    very functional family, just as my law firm is not dysfunctional in any way.
                    I've kind of given them the feel we have to all be one and all part of a family
                    if we're going to make this work and become a great law firm. And it's done well
                    in this large law firm. And in my personal family it's done exceedingly well.
                    Helen gave up the things she liked as we got more and more into politics. She
                    didn't have time, and I didn't have time to go to concerts with her or do other
                    things I might have done. She pretty well changed her life. She moved with me to
                    Washington half the time when I was Treasurer, which meant that she gave up her
                    card games, bridge and other games, with her friends in the afternoon and things
                    like that. So her life became intertwined in my political life, and her support
                    had much to do with my success to the extent I was successful. I found that
                    people in the Democratic Party, whenever I showed up anywhere without her,
                    they'd say, “Where's Helen?” If I went to Columbus, Ohio, for a speech to the
                    Party there when I was Chairman, Paul Tipps, the State Chairman, would say,
                    “Where's Helen? Why didn't you bring her?” The same thing was true whether it
                    was in New York or whether it was in Kentucky with then Governor Wendell Ford.
                    So Helen played a major role, not just being supportive but she was a part of my
                    political team although she couldn't stand on her feet and utter two sentences
                    before an audience. But she forced herself to do those things and do them well.
                    So much of what I've done throughout my career... When George Bush was pushing
                    me to go to Russia - I think I've told this story earlier - when I said, “I want
                    to talk to Helen,” he said, “I'll call her.” I said, “Mr. President, don't you
                    dare call her. You'll talk her into it. She couldn't say no to you but she could
                    to me. I'll discuss it with her.” He laughed and said, “Anyway you want it.” But
                    when I told Helen - she was then 71 years of age - that the President wanted us
                    to go to Russia for two years, that was the last thing on her mind and she said,
                    “Well, when would we go?” I said, “Well, I don't know.” She said, “Well, there's
                    one thing I can't do. I'm not going to leave before Susan has her baby.” Our
                    daughter was then at the age of 40 having her first child, so Helen was not very
                    hot about being gone then. I said, “Well, I'll negotiate with the President also
                    if we do this, and we won't leave until after that baby's born in early
                    September.” She said, “Well, whatever you say, but I'll have to be here.” I
                    said, “I know you do.” But anyway, she hitched her pants up and went to Russia
                    for two years. It wasn't a pleasant life for her. We didn't have a social life.
                    We didn't have any other kind of life except work all day, and usually several
                    nights a week we had receptions in the evening and she would be the hostess for
                    them. I'd tell her there were going to be 150 people coming for cocktails three
                    or four nights a week or more often, visitors from out of town or Russians we
                    had to entertain and other such things. She never backed off a minute. She'd
                    say, “What time do I show up and where?” So my children really were supportive
                    of me in every way, and of their mother, and their mother was certainly
                    supportive of all of us. It had a lot to do with making all my experiences in
                    politics happy experiences. I just wanted to get that in here.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it's very important for people to understand what
                        a burden it is and what a support there is with the family. One of the
                        things is that when you get somebody in the diplomatic world, you get
                        somebody as 'twofer'; that means you get two for the price of one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: That's exactly right, and frequently the other one is a negative, is a
                    draw against the principal, but Helen was a great asset. There was nothing
                    negative about her. The negative things were about me. There was a joke told,
                    I'm sure not altogether in jest, but my deputy was a young woman who used to get
                    a big laugh out of the story of Helen and I being out with her when I made an
                    important speech, a significant speech, here in Washington. Driving home from
                    the speech I was thinking about all the standing applause I got. According to
                    this young woman - she loved to tell the story - I said, “Helen, you know, there
                    really aren't many real leaders in this country anymore,” and, she replied, “As
                    a matter of fact, there's even one less than you think, Bob.” That's pretty much
                    Helen's feeling about it. Happily, that story's apocryphal, not true, although
                    it's been told so many times that it's become true. As a matter of fact, a
                    number of Presidential candidates use it on themselves now, so it's become sort
                    of standard lore for a fellow running for office. But anyway, that takes care of
                    that side. Now, we were going to talk for a minute about...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We wanted to go back to Watergate and leading up to it.

                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: The first time Watergate came to my attention was when a fellow named
                    Bob Schmidt, who worked for International Telephone &amp; Telegraph - he was
                    their man in Washington to the Democratic Party, their liaison to the Democratic
                    Party; Bob Schmidt was a friend of mine - he called me one day and said, “I have
                    to see you. It's an emergency.” I said, “Well, come on over, Bob.” He said,
                    “Bob, there's a story breaking in Saint Louis that the ITT gave $400,000 to the
                    Republican Party in return for getting an antitrust case out of the way where
                    they could make the acquisition of a particular insurance company. The story was
                    that it was nothing but a bribe, a $400,000 bribe, hidden in a so-called gift to
                    assist them in putting on their Convention.” I said, “What does that have to do
                    with me?” He said, “I came for your advice. My headquarters wants to know what I
                    think we ought to do about it, and I don't know what they ought to do about it.”
                    I said, “Well, I know exactly what they ought to do about it. I don't know
                    whether we would do it.” I was then Treasurer of the Democratic Party. I said,
                    “If I was in your shoes, I'd give an equal sum to the Democratic Party to put on
                    their Convention, and then no one could say that $400,000 was anything but what
                    you said it was.” I said, “By the way, how much truth is there to this story? I
                    presume a good deal, or you wouldn't be here so nervous.” He said, “Well, let me
                    just say this. There's enough truth to it that we just can't have that story get
                    out as it is.” I said, “Well, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll have lunch today
                    with Larry O'Brien, our Chairman, and I will ask him what he wants to do. It's
                    his call. He's the Chairman of the Party. But I must tell you this: I doubt
                    seriously that we'd take that money.” So O'Brien and I had lunch, and O'Brien
                    was a very canny politician. He said to me, “Well, Bob, can you raise enough
                    money to put on our Convention without that $400,000?” I said, “Yes. It won't be
                    easy, but we can get along without it.” He said, “Well, I don't think we ought
                    to take it.” I said, “Well, that's exactly what I told Bob Schmidt, that I
                    didn't think we would take it but it was your call.” He said, “If you want to
                    take it, I'll approve it, because you're going to have to raise the money, but
                    if it doesn't make any difference to you - we don't have a damn thing going for
                    us - we might as well see if something comes out of this, this so-called
                    scandal.” So, sure enough, we turned it down and, sure enough, in no time it
                    became a big story. A lobbyists for ITT called Dita Beard, who was in the middle
                    of it, and the story got bigger and bigger. They were going to hold their
                    Convention in San Diego, and I called a fellow, Dick Herman, who was putting on
                    the Convention for the Republicans, who was an old friend of mine, a nice man
                    from Omaha then who has since moved to the West Coast, who was a good friend of
                    the Bush family, as I remember. Dick Herman was out there signing contracts for
                    the Republican Convention in San Diego, and I told him that story. He said, “I
                    can't believe it.” I said, “Well, it's true, so you'd better be careful.” He
                    said, “Well, I just don't believe it. I can't believe it's true.” I said, “Well,
                    that's up to you. I at least told you what I know. You're an old friend, and
                    you're entitled to know this.” Sure enough, the story got bigger and bigger.
                    John Connally was then Secretary of Treasury and just finishing up his
                    Treasuryship or maybe he was still Secretary. About this time, the Fort Worth
                    Bar Association gave a party for him in Fort Worth in connection, I think, with
                    a Bar Association meeting, a big reception for Governor Connally, and Helen and
                    I and fellow named George Christian who was in Dallas drove over with me and
                    also Johnny Apple who's with New York Times and who was in Dallas. We drove over
                    to Fort Worth. We were going through the receiving line and then Secretary
                    Connally said to me, “Bob, as soon as this damn line is over, this receiving
                    line, I need to talk to you.” I said, “Fine.” He said, “Slip over there in the
                    corner, and I'll get over there as quick as I can.” So the receiving line ended,
                    I went over in the corner to see my old friend Governor, now Secretary of the
                    Treasury, Connally, and I said, “What's on your mind, John?” He said, “Well, the
                    Republicans can't have their Convention in San Diego because this story's
                    getting too big about the $400,000 bribe. They're going to have to move their
                    whole damn Convention out of San Diego. The $400,000 had been spent.” I said,
                    “What does that have to do with me?” He said, “Well, they now, at this late
                    date, want to go to Florida, and Governor Askew said we couldn't go to Florida
                    unless Bob Strauss approved it because the Democrats were coming there and he
                    had made a deal with Strauss.” Askew was a man of great character. He said, “If
                    Strauss says okay, he'll be glad to have you here, would like to have you but
                    not until he okays it.” So I thought about it, discussed it with several of the
                    members of our committee, and we agreed we should say okay to Askew and tell him
                    we would not object. That it was going to be somewhere, and we could share some
                    of the convention expense. And what I did was I then called my friend Dick
                    Herman again, who was in San Diego making arrangements for the Republican
                    Convention, and said “You're not going to have it out there.” He said, “You're
                    crazy as hell.” I said, “Dick, take my word for it.” He said, “Well, they've got
                    me signing contracts every day. I've got $1,000,000 committed already, or some
                    such number.” I said, “Well, I can tell you this. John Mitchell called...”</p>

                    unless Strauss approved it, said okay, he wouldn't do it. He'd like to do it but
                    he wasn't going to do it, put the Republicans on top of the Democrats unless
                    Strauss okayed it for the Party.” I called Dick Herman again. He said, “I'll be
                    damned. That son-of-a-bitch John Mitchell has misled me. I've talked to him
                    twice a day for the last month and he's never mentioned this.” I said, “Well,
                    I'll tell you,” and I told him the whole story.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, we had gotten along well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, Reuben Askew, the Governor of Florida, was a
                        Democrat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, and a potential Presidential candidate; sought the Presidency
                    unsuccessfully. He was a very important Democrat and a very fine man and a very
                    good friend of mine. He and a number of other governors were responsible for my
                    being elected Chairman. Reuben Askew and governors like Wendell Ford were strong
                    supporters and I turned to them often for advice and support. I was a product of
                    the Democratic governors. If I don't have it in here earlier, might as well put
                    it in now. I'm trying to think of the order in which this all came. I negotiated
                    with Dick Herman that, where they would pay part of our expenses for the things
                    we were doing that they would also use. There was wiring and there's
                    construction and a lot of things going with the Convention that would work for
                    both of us, so he and I negotiated it. If I would okay them coming in there,
                    we'd share those expenses, so we picked up maybe $100,000 that we would have
                    spent, maybe a little more, maybe a little less, I don't remember. But it worked
                    out fine. The reason it worked out so well is that Dick Herman and I had this
                    relationship. Today the relationship between political parties and between the
                    leaders of the parties is acrimonious, or at least not friendly enough that you
                    can do that sort of things. In those days there was a good deal more civility to
                    the relationship between the various chairmen. Be that as it may, the ITT matter
                    went on to become, as you know, a major, major event. It led to the Watergate
                    break-in, it led to a lot of other things, and it was a turning point and, I
                    think, was basically responsible for Jimmy Carter much later being elected
                    President. He ran “I'll give you a government as good as the American people
                    themselves,” obviously talking about Watergate. I guess that's a pretty roughly
                    told story of how that all happened.</p>

                        Negotiator for the Middle East. This was when about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: In 1979 Jimmy Carter called me - I was his trade negotiator, Special
                    Trade Representative - and said, “Bob, I agreed, as you know, with Begin and
                    Sadat that I would stay with the three of them and we'd be a committee of three
                    to try to move the Middle East peace process along. But I can't do that and be
                    President. It takes more time.” This was after Sadat's visit in a framework
                    of...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also after Camp David too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, after Sadat's visit to Camp David. But I said, “I don't know
                    whether my being Jewish would have a negative impact in Egypt. You ought to
                    think about that.” He said, “It won't work unless Begin also will approve it.
                    But I think they'll approve. They know you and I are close, and when they see
                    you sitting there, they'll see me sitting there because they know you are going
                    to repeat to me every word. The President said to me, “They know you're going to
                    repeat every word to me, and they'll accept that. So,” he said, “how would you
                    go about getting their approval?” I said, “Well, I'll tell you what we could do.
                    I'm the Trade Representative, so I'll put together a little trade mission to the
                    Middle East, and while I'm there I'll spend some time with Sadat and Begin and
                    they'll get to know me.” He said, “That's a very good idea.” So in a few days'
                    time we organized a little trade mission and worked out with the Egyptians and
                    the Israelis that we'd be coming over. I took 10 or 15 businesspeople with me,
                    and I took a good friend of mine, Lee Kling, along to help me. He is a good
                    Democrat and a business leader back in the state of Missouri, so he could follow
                    through on this stuff because I was still tied up in the Tokyo Round, which we
                    were negotiating in the Special Trade Representative's office. The trip went
                    well, and I liked Begin much more than I expected to; and he liked me better
                    than he expected to, I think. The same thing was true with Sadat. I just sort of
                    fell in love with Sadat. He captured my imagination.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is what I gather. Sadat, at least to the Westerner,

                <p>STRAUSS: He had it all. He is one of the two or three most impressive men I've
                    known in my political career. So when I returned, Carter contacted them and
                    asked them how they'd feel about me coming into those negotiations and sitting
                    in in his place. And they both sort of liked the idea. They knew I'd have plenty
                    of time compared to him. They approved it, and growing out of that, I developed
                    a rather fast friendship with each of them. And we made a little modest
                    progress, not much but a little. No one has made very much. We did establish a
                    basic framework for the future negotiations with the Egyptians and the
                    Israelis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll come to the Palestinian side, but what were the
                        issues between Israel and Egypt that you found yourself working on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Everything. Nothing had been solved out there except the very important
                    basic agreement between the two leaders. As a matter of fact, it's probably
                    worse. When I think of all the things that were troublesome, two things stand
                    out in my mind. On the Israeli side, the settlement problem, particularly
                    Sharon's role in the settlements and the way he was driving further every day,
                    was a tremendous negative. And from the Israeli side, the fact that you had
                    Palestinians who just had no interest in making peace and whose leadership would
                    do everything possible to keep peace from being made. So you had hard-liners on
                    both side, and you had negative things going from both sides. The truth of the
                    matter is they're not much nearer solving those today than they were when I was
                    out there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it's worse, much worse.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Much worse, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On that particular issue, how did you view the situation
                        that Congress had put us into where we promised we wouldn't talk to the
                        Palestine Liberation Organization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: It was a problem, it was a problem. I think I could have established
                    some sort of speaking relationship with the Palestinians, because relationships
                    have been my strength. There were a lot of things I couldn't do well out there
                    because I didn't know the issues well enough, but I had very good people with me
                    who did. I've never had trouble with interpersonal relationships, and it's been
                    my strength. Any person with any brains knows you play your strength, and that
                    was the strength I had I didn't get a chance to use. I tried to send subtle
                    messages, back-channel messages, but that didn't work; you needed to be
                    personally involved. We couldn't talk, as you know. Andy Young, who was our man
                    out there, lost his job because he was accused of a secret dialogue with the
                    Palestinians.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I forget who got us into it. I would doubt that it was Kissinger. But it
                    was there when I got there and it's there today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with Begin? People I've talked to
                        say one of the problems with Begin was that he would give you a half-hour or
                        an hour lecture on historical Israel before you could even begin work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, I think that's probably a fair statement, but I'll also tell you
                    that I was a Jewish fellow who had never had any formal or other education in
                    Jewish affairs, rarely had ever been in a temple or synagogue. I was overly
                    reformed: I have never been; I have never been Bar Mitzvahs; I never have been
                    confirmed. I used a joke one time in a speech I made here, a humorous speech
                    before the Alfalfa Club, and brought the house down with a line that I used,
                    talking about being Jewish, that said, “Where I come from in west Texas, they
                    though Hanukkah was a duck call,” and it brought down the house. That's about
                    where I was, and Begin was amazed that he liked a fellow like me. He'd never
                    seen a Jew with my background. That intrigued him, and growing out of that came
                    a very nice friendship. I was just discussing it the other day with a fellow
                    from Israel that knew the story of my relationship with Begin, and he said, “I'm
                    told that you were the only person Menachem Begin ever said, 'Call me Menachem,'
                    because he was a very proper and formal man.” I may have mentioned this earlier
                    in this tape; I don't know. He was a very formal man, and everyone addressed him
                    with formality; no one called him Menachem. What happened was I mentioned to his
                    ambassador to this country how fond I had grown of Begin and didn't expect to,
                    and I said, “I wish I was a little more Jewish. Maybe he would feel the same way
                    about me.” He said, “Bob, he couldn't feel any better about you. Everybody
                    around him was shocked when he told you, 'Call me Menachem, and I'll call you
                    Bob.'" Unfortunately, both Begin and Sadat used to pronounce Bob as if it was
                    Boob. I used to say to people, “I'm not sure that's an accident.” It was good
                    for a laugh, anyway. Sadat also was a fellow who captured your imagination, much
                    more than Begin. I don't know whether I mentioned this or not before, but I can
                    remember negotiating with Anwar Sadat when he had me out to his summer home near
                    the pyramids. I think I've told this story earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not sure if you did.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Let me tell it again. It doesn't take but a minute. He had me out to his
                    summer place which overlooks the pyramids. I didn't get out there till about
                    nine o'clock at night, and there was a beautiful full moon. We talked for three
                    or four hours, and in the course of conversation he had placed me facing him and
                    behind him were the pyramids. Between Sadat and me was a low candle flickering.
                    When that low candle flickered on his face, that marvelous face of his, on a
                    moonlit night with the pyramids in the background, it was a setting made to
                    order for him and it just captured him in the most appealing way, and he
                    captured me anyway. After this long discussion, the ambassador who was with me,
                    the American ambassador to Egypt was with me in the car and we were riding back
                    to the hotel, and he said, “What do you want to say in the overnight cable?” (On
                    occasions such as this, it was customary to send an overnight cable addressed to
                    the President, but it goes to the State Department, giving a report on what had
                    occurred at the particular meeting.). My head was just full of everything that
                    Sadat had been telling me, and I said, “Ambassador, I'll tell you what you do.
                    You just send this cable. You describe the scene I've just described to you and
                    say in that scene “I don't know what I bought except I bought everything Sadat
                    was selling. More will follow tomorrow when I clear my mind on it better and can
                    do it in an orderly way.” I heard it caused quite a laugh back in the State
                    Department when it was received, but it was darn near the truth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Sadat particularly interested in the Palestinian
                        side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I don't know that to be true. I think he was interested in absolutely
                    ensuring that he got that land back...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about the Sinai.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: ...the Sinai, when he got the Sinai back and that the Camp David Accords
                    were implemented. I don't think he gave a damn whether or not the Jordanians
                    were involved or not, or the Palestinians were involved or not. I think he
                    wanted to get his business taken care of. He would have loved to have gotten it
                    all done, but mainly he nailed down his issue, and I will point out to you he
                    got every inch of ground back from the Sinai that he was promised and to this
                    day there's never been a drop of blood shed in that border between Egypt and
                    Israel. It's getting tough over there now, and the President of Egypt is getting
                    tougher to do business with. He's not the reformer that he was before.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, Mubarak. So it's far more difficult now than it was before. But
                    Sadat got what he wanted and gave what he had to give, which, of course, later,
                    not long after, caused his assassination by people who were afraid that he was
                    going to bring peace in the region, and they didn't want it. Those bastards
                    killed that wonderful man.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you run across Sharon, Ariel Sharon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was he viewed? What were you getting from the State
                        Department and from your own personal...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Sharon was viewed by everyone as a warrior, a military man and a
                    warrior, and he took me on the same ride he's taken many others. He put me in a
                    helicopter and took me over the settlement area and showed me how wonderful it
                    was and how it was working out and how it would bring peace and enable Israel to
                    defend itself and, because of that, it would enable peace to be made. Well, I
                    didn't buy into that then and I don't buy into it now. I think the settlements
                    have been a big, big negative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it's the real issue today.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: It's the issue today. It's one of the real issues today, but I don't see
                    it changing as soon as it should. I think in the next two or three years that
                    will be dealt with, I think that will be dealt with. It's so bad now that I
                    think it's going to get better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it couldn't be worse.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time did you have any sort of Israeli or Egyptian
                        experts on a team?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh, hell, yes. Oh, yes.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: I don't recall names right now, but I can get them. I had the best the
                    State Department had and I needed them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I felt the State Department, most of them in the Middle East section,
                    were very anti-Israel, and I didn't trust them as far as I could throw them. On
                    the brighter side, some of them were very goovery professional.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did you think this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Because of the things they said and the things they stood for. I was
                    very careful how I got briefed, and I didn't swallow everything I was fed. I
                    talked to people who knew the Middle East, Europeans as well as Americans who
                    knew the Middle East well, and Middle Easterners, and I got other input. So I
                    had somewhat of a balanced view of it. I just thought of the fellows name who
                    really was my right-hand man in the State Department, but he was way above that.
                    He had too much character. His name is Hal Saunders, a most impressive public
                    servant. But with most of those people over there the pro-Arab point of view was
                    a good deal stronger than I thought was balanced. I didn't pay as much attention
                    to people who warned me early of this bias that has existed for years and years.
                    And I don't think I'm prejudiced because of my Jewish faith, because I'm
                    certainly very critical of the Israelis also...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this point was there any sense of - the word is
                        probably wrong - desperation on the Carter side because of oil?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: No, not at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because this was really beginning to bite towards that
                        point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Carter sent me - I told this story to you earlier, I think, in this
                    tape; yes, that was the last thing we talked about earlier...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, about getting oil, but I was just wondering whether,
                        as you were doing these special negotiations between the two...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oil never came into it, just didn't. That wasn't Carter. It might have
                    with some Presidents, but that just didn't cross Carter's mind. It may have
                    crossed his mind, but he was looking for peace. Carter didn't get along with
                    Menachem Begin very well. He did with Sadat exceedingly well. The Israeli
                    ambassador told me in the middle of these negotiations when I was in this job -
                    not in the middle of it, towards the end of my role - he said, “Bob, you and I
                    are friends. Senator Ribicoff...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Abraham Ribicoff, Senator from Connecticut.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: He said Ribicoff was very balanced on this subject. As a matter of fact,
                    you know, Ribicoff had fallen out with the Israelis to some extent, really with
                    AIPAC, because he approved the plane deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the plane deal with the Saudi Arabians.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Ambassador Evron, Israeli Ambassador Evron to this country, said to me,
                    “Bob, get out of that job. You're killing yourself with all you're doing and you
                    can't make any progress.” He said, “I can tell you that the Palestinians and the
                    Egyptians are not going to move anymore, and Begin couldn't move another inch if
                    his life depended on it. He gave away more than he should, in the view of
                    everyone in Israel, so he has no more maneuverability. He did that because
                    Carter convinced him he ought to do it, and I'm sure he regretted it right after
                    he did it, and he's not going to move another inch. He can't.” So I was
                    delighted when a couple months later Kennedy, who was making progress in his
                    primary campaign against Carter, and Carter asked me to get out of the Middle
                    East and take over his campaign for renomination.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Senator Edward Kennedy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move to that, how did you work during this time
                        as special negotiator with Carter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it operate? Did you come back and brief him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Carter kept up to date weekly. Carter had his Cabinet members write him
                    each week at the end of the week what they had done that week, what progress
                    they had made, what failures they'd had, what issues they had dealt with. I had
                    a good relationship with Carter, I'd go by and talk with him about things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that you would find yourself playing sort of
                        a mediating role, because from what I've heard of the two gentlemen,
                        Menachem Begin was a very strong sort of fundamentalist on his side and
                        Jimmy Carter was a strong fundamentalist on his side. I can see why they
                        wouldn't get along very well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: They didn't get along very well at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself sort of playing the role of...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, I told each what nice things the other said about him and how they
                    were each trying, which was true. But Carter was easy for me to work with. He
                    was tough and he was stubborn and hard headed, but he was honest and smart and I
                    liked him. He knew I was honest, and we had a good relationship. National
                    Security Advisor, Brzezinski was very smart and was a big influence on Carter's
                    thinking and while he and I differed on many issues, he too, was a brilliant man
                    and honest to a fault.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, National Security Advisor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Exactly. One time I was on a trip to the Middle East and got an envelope
                    from the President that said, “Do not open until you get airborne.” I was on a
                    trip to go over for negotiations. I opened the envelope and it was Carter's
                    little message in there that said, “Strauss, be strong and be tough and be this
                    and do this and do that and don't get soft.” I was so goddamn mad when I read
                    that I could have had a stroke. I called the White House and asked to speak to
                    him. I said, “Mr. President, Brzezinski dictated this damn thing, didn't he?”
                    and he said yes. I said, “Well, maybe you ought to send Brzezinski over here
                    instead of me, because I don't need this kind of instructions. If I'm going to
                    get it, I ought to get my instructions before I get in the air.” I was really
                    annoyed. The press was on there with me, and they knew I was annoyed about it
                    because they could hear some of the discussion, but nobody wrote it because I
                    asked them not to. Carter was nice and said, “I didn't intend to offend you, but
                    Zbig thought maybe you ought to have those very firm instructions.” I said, “Let
                    him come over and do it if you want to Mr. President, but I just can't work that
                    way.” By then I was doing a great deal for the White House. I had the Middle
                    East and I had inflation, I had the regular trade business, I had Congress to
                    worry about. That was a marvelous opportunity for me, because so many different
                    things came to me when my job was really Special Trade Representative.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: He's just one of the smartest guys around, but he's hard line in his own
                    way and his interpersonal relationships were not great. His ability to create
                    interpersonal relationships was not great, but he's a very able, very talented
                    man. I was just saying this yesterday to somebody, that I wish one of these
                    people on this 9/11 investigative committee they were going to have, I wish
                    somebody would put Brzezinski on it because he'd be very good. He's a very able

                <p>STRAUSS: Oh, we'd made modest progress, very little, but we made a few little
                    bits of progress. I was just in that role for less than a year, and I had good
                    people with me. I'm glad I did it. I didn't hurt anything, that's for sure, and
                    Sadat got killed shortly after I got out of that, assassinated, and I was glad I
                    wasn't in there when that happened.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Israeli lobby, AIPAC, American-Israeli Political

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: No, they're just like every other interest group. They make their case.
                    They were effective on the Hill much more than most interest groups, but I was
                    effective on the Hill myself. The Hill didn't give me any trouble ever in any
                    negotiation I ever had.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Let me just think a minute. Senator Scoop Jackson, when he was in
                    office, was certainly a strong ally, as was Humphrey, Muskie, Speaker Carl
                    Albert, Lloyd Bentsen. I can't think of them all right now.</p>

                <p>STRAUSS: That's exactly what it was, and that's the way it was written up by the

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what about the Kennedy challenge? Could you talk

                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: After I left my job, I took over the campaign for Carter, after I left
                    my STR job and these other things. I took over the campaign and moved my papers
                    over to campaign headquarters and started running the campaign to renominate the
                    President. What happened there was I pushed Carter very hard to debate Kennedy
                    early and get it out of the way. President Carter was uncomfortable debating
                    Kennedy. He thought it would give him too much of a platform. But I was right in
                    hindsight and he was wrong. He put it off and put it off and put it off, and
                    finally had to debate him and, when he did, he did fine, but Kennedy had made a
                    lot of progress by then that he shouldn't have made. So it was a difficult
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you define the issues between Kennedy and
                        Carter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: The issue in a primary scrap like that was who could win and who could
                    keep the Democrats in control of the White House. Every time Kennedy would win a
                    state, and he would, then people wanted to be against Carter for a lot of
                    reasons, but they didn't want Kennedy for a lot of reasons. We'd do real well.
                    If we won two or three states, you'd know you were going to run into a state you
                    were going to lose because they wanted to send a message to Carter also. But we
                    finally finished it off in California. I don't think it's ever endeared me to
                    Ted Kennedy and his people, which I hate, because I'm a great admirer of Ted
                    Kennedy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel in a way that Carter was running against
                        Carter in the primaries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, yes, but Ted Kennedy made it awfully difficult. He was an
                    attractive man and a hard candidate, and you remember when he finally lost at
                    the Convention he didn't behave very well. He wouldn't endorse, wouldn't
                    enthusiastically bring the party together, which he could have done. I think the
                    Kennedy challenge had something substantial to do with Carter's defeat in the
                    general election, but I think there were other factors as well including the
                    fact that Jimmy Carter wasn't a particularly strong candidate. He had so many
                    problems, and he hadn't been a particularly effective President in the public's
                    mind. So he had his own vulnerabilities, and Senator Kennedy correctly played on
                    them, as I would have done if I were him. We knocked him out of there, but it
                    wasn't easy for a sitting President to have to do that, and it left the party
                    split that went into that campaign against Ronald Reagan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Ronald Reagan viewed at the beginning when he was
                        a rising candidate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, we viewed him incorrectly. I, among others, never thought that the
                    Republicans would nominate him. I thought when it came down to it they'd
                    nominate someone else, and I thought, when they did nominate him, that they
                    couldn't elect him. The night that they put George Bush, who was also a friend
                    of mine, on his ticket with him, it was late, you remember, about midnight,
                    because Henry Kissinger had tried to get Jerry Ford on the ticket to sort of be
                    a co-president, if you will recall. And that blew up terribly and the Reagan
                    people had to do something in a hurry because all this was playing out on
                    national television. That forced them to do something they didn't want to do and
                    that was take George Bush, because the Reagans and their people didn't have any
                    use for Bush but they needed a vice president in a hurry that night. Much to
                    Bush's surprise, they picked him, and to a lot of other people's surprise. My
                    phone rang about midnight that night - I may have told this story earlier but it
                    bears repeating to be sure you get it in - and it was the White House saying,
                    “The President wants to speak with you, Mr. Strauss, and Mr. Powell and Hamilton
                    Jordan.” So the three of us got connected and the President said, “What do you
                    think, boys?” Hamilton or Jody, one of them, said, “You go first, Mr. Chairman,”
                    and I said, “Mr. President, I think they've nominated the only two guys in
                    America I'm sure we can beat,” and laughed. And the two fellows laughed, but the
                    President didn't laugh one damn bit. He didn't think that was very funny. But
                    that shows you how wrong I was. I never thought that Reagan would win that race
                    until the last couple of weeks. At the last debate, I knew we were in trouble,
                    because Carter handled it so poorly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time the impression was that Carter was not an
                        effective President and wasn't getting anywhere. In retrospect one looks
                        back on it and is really quite impressed by the accomplishments.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Very impressed by the accomplishments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But at that time did you feel that Carter would be a hard
                        sell?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: He was a very hard sell at that time. People felt like he sold them a
                    bill of goods when he ran and couldn't deliver. He looked weak and ineffective.
                    The truth of the matter is, if you look at his record, he had a damn good
                    record. For example, several of us tried to convince him the Panama Canal Treaty
                    was important but as a second-term issue to deal with, not the first term. You'd
                    pay too high a price for it. As it turned out, we finally passed the Treaty in
                    the Senate. But we squeezed so many Senators to get their votes, after that
                    whenever you go to a Senator and say, “Senator, can you give the White House a
                    vote on this issue or that issue or the other issue?” they'd all say the same
                    thing: “Hell, I voted for you on that Panama Canal. I've got to take care of my
                    own business now and get over that, because it hurt me in my state.” So we paid
                    a hell of a price for that, but Carter thought it was the right thing to do, and
                    he never looked back on that kind of thing. Was it the right thing to do. It was
                    admirable, but not good politics. I've got to run now, but after the first of
                    the year I'll give you all the time you want.</p>

                        We really haven't talked about the 1980 defeat. We talked about leading up
                        to it, but we'll talk about what went on and all and then after that.</hi>

                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is January 9, 2003. Going back to 1980, during the election period, how did
                    you view the setup? The Republicans and the Middle East. Let's take the Middle
                    East first. Was there an attitude? How did you feel about the new team that was
                    going to be coming in?</p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, I'd seen enough of the Middle East to know that that was almost an
                    intractable problem at that time. As a matter of fact, while I was in that job,
                    during the Middle East, the Israeli ambassador to this country, Ambassador
                    Evron, Eppy Evron, took me to lunch one day at the Senate Office Building with
                    Senator Ribicoff, who was also interested in the Middle East, and he said to me
                    then, “You ought to get out of that job. You can't make any progress.” I think I
                    have this earlier in these tapes, but I'm not sure, so I'll just plug it in here
                    pretty quickly. We were trying to get a broader framework for the Middle East,
                    but we couldn't make more headway. But he said, “You can't make any more
                    progress. Institutions and interests in the Middle East are not going to move an
                    inch. And I can tell you,” he said, “Begin cannot move an inch. He went further
                    than he should have gone at Camp David. Nobody on either side wants to see this
                    thing move any further. They'd both just as soon see it sit where it is. It's
                    tragic, it's sad, but that's a fact, and you ought to get out of this job before
                    it kills you.” Well, I took his advice very seriously, but was about 30 days
                    after he gave me that advice, as I recall, lo and behold, President Carter
                    called one day and said, “Bob, I want you to give up the Middle East - Kennedy's
                    entered the campaign, the primary - and take over the political side now.” I
                    didn't let President Carter know how delighted I was to get that, because I was
                    searching for a way to get out of that impossible situation without letting him
                    down. This did it, and I recommended he take Sol Linowitz as my successor. He
                    said, “Well, Sol's too old.” I said, “He's not too old, and he's smart.” Anyway,
                    Linowitz took the job, and he certainly did as well as I would have donmaybe
                    better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see a change in attitude or approach towards the
                        Middle East as this transition started working up? Were you talking to any
                        people?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: No, nothing really of major consequence took place. They didn't spend
                    any time on it. It was one of those things you just kind of handle like a
                    low-grade infection, you know—maybe it isn't going to kill you, and what you've
                    got to do is just see it doesn't spread and you kind of keep your hands on it,
                    but you know you can't cure it either. That's about the way, unhappily, it was
                    treated. No one has come as close to a real accord as Bill Clinton did in the
                    last few days, week or two, of his government. He had a deal, and, unhappily, he
                    squeezed the Israelis into offering a lot more than anybody ever dreamed they
                    would offer. It was 97 percent of what the other side wanted, and they turned it
                    down. I'm sure everyone regrets it, with the exception of the Palestinian
                    leadership, and maybe only the man at the top.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about on trade? Was there a difference in attitude,
                        or was it more of the same?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I think the trade issues were pretty well the same on both sides. Each
                    side, of course, might try to politicize a specific issue, whether it be in
                    steel or in agriculture or in anything else, but I don't think there was a
                    dime's worth of difference overall between the approach of the Carter
                    Administration and then of the Reagan Administration and of later
                    administrations. This country has pretty well maintained a progressive free
                    market policy, although if you look at some of the things we've done, if you
                    look at this most recent farm bill that came out of the Congress last year, it's
                    disgraceful. Where we've really gotten in the last year, we've almost gotten to
                    the stage of demanding people to keep their doors open to trade with us but
                    we'll not open ours to them, whether it's steel or whatever. Our trade
                    ambassador that represents this country right now in this administration is a
                    first-rate fellow, very bright, very able.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, and one of the brightest guys around. He's done a good job on these
                    trade issues to the extent that he's been able to and to the extent the
                    administration would let him. He's aggressive and he's smart although he doesn't
                    do particularly well on the Hill, so I hear.</p>

                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: I went back to my law firm. As a matter of fact, I went back a little
                    earlier than that, and I stayed in my law firm for close to 10 years, a little
                    over. A Republican President, George Bush, called me - and I've been through
                    that - and sent me to Russia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about those 10 years. Did you find yourself
                        called upon as sort of a Democratic consultant to get involved, or were you
                        ducking that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh, I did a number of things that I enjoyed. I was named Democratic
                    chairman of a National Economic Commission to try to write an economic plan for
                    this country. That was done prior to the election of George Bush, Sr., the year
                    before he was elected. With help from the leading people in this country,
                    whether it be Paul Volker or George Shultz - we had all kinds of distinguished
                    participants and witnesses on the economic side - we came up with a pretty good
                    program, but then President Bush's people didn't want to do anything. We kept
                    telling them they ought to take that program of ours, even if they didn't send
                    it up to the Congress then. It could come out in the spring of the following
                    year. I and others on our commission, bipartisan commission, urged the
                    administration to take a serious look at adopting it, if not now, put it on the
                    shelf for adopting later in the year or the next year when they were going to
                    need it, but their people didn't want anything to do with it. So nothing came of
                    it, and they made a major mistake, in my judgment. It might have saved Bush,
                    Senior's second term.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were some of the key figures you felt who had Bush
                        avoid this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I think Dick Darman, who was an economic advisor to Bush, took a dim
                    view of it. Nick Brady, who was Secretary of Treasury, didn't have any
                    confidence in it. So the people around him weren't interested in his getting
                    into this sort of thing. They now believe that not having an economic program
                    that made any sense was a significant reason for his defeat. So I spent a year
                    and a half devoting a third of my time or more to that particular program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, there are these studies and these commissions
                        that go on all the time and, well, they're not adopted. Do you have the
                        feeling that these sort of enter the political bloodstream somehow anyway
                        even when you do this and eventually something comes out of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I think it all helps. We had a rather distinguished group of people on
                    that commission. I don't recall all of them, but we had first-rate people in
                    this country, by and large, on that commission. The present Secretary of
                    Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, was a member of it. Lane Kirkland, who was head of the
                    AFL-CIO, a powerful man, was on it. Senator Domenici was on it and others of
                    equal stature. I was also deeply involved in the Bipartisan Commission on
                    Central America, which came to be known as the Kissinger Commission. The
                    Kissinger Commission had good people on it also, we wrote a good report and it
                    went nowhere.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes. Those issues were controversial, and they needed highly visible
                    Republicans and highly visible Democrats who had credibility to serve on it.
                    They didn't really want it, but they sort of inherited it whether they wanted it
                    or not, and they got Kissinger to serve as chairman of it and they got me and
                    others like Nick Brady.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this Central American task force, what were you
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, we made one, possibly two - I recall one vividly - trip to Central
                    America, went to talk to the various players down there, about a four-day trip,
                    as I recall. Interestingly, on that trip the White House staff person that was
                    sent to help this commission was Oliver North. I didn't even remember it, but
                    people told me later it was Oliver North. He was nothing then and he's nothing
                    now, but that was just one little interesting sidelight. That commission, thanks
                    primarily to Henry Kissinger, wrote a damn good report, just a first-rate
                    report. No one paid any attention to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the thrust?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Let me see if I can describe it in just a few words. The thrust was that
                    we had to do something down there that we weren't doing and that we had to bring
                    certain groups in and bring them together, and that there were certain
                    undesirable groups that this country had to deal with down there and we were
                    making a major mistake if we didn't go in and try to help establish real
                    democracy in those countries, help them bring responsible people to come to
                    power, in that part of the world. Kissinger did much of the work and frankly
                    wrote most of the report. A number of us participated in it, but he was so good
                    and he had a good staff - Henry always had good staff people - and I just think,
                    as usual, things he does he does exceedingly well. You can like or dislike him,
                    you can agree or disagree with him, but he's got an IQ and he uses it. When he
                    takes responsibility, he discharges it. That's the reason here he is, it's been
                    over 30 years since he's been in office and I think he's got more influence
                    today than he did when he was Secretary of State. But he also used to jokingly
                    say that, after we turned our report in to President Reagan, who had precious
                    little interest in it, Henry said, “Well, this report has some use. We've got
                    50,000 copies printed, and no one's interested in reading it. Let's take it and
                    drop them, use them as bombs and drop them; I think we can eliminate our
                    undesirable elements in Central America, which was a sad but true humorous
                    statement.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this 10-year period after you left the
                        Chairmanship, what was your relationship, and what had been your
                        relationship, with George Bush, Sr.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: George Bush, Sr. and I have had a unique relationship for many, many
                    years. We have the Texas background. We ended up Chairmen of our respective
                    parties at the same time. We got along well; the Chairmen today of those parties
                    don't have much of anything to do with each other. We talked with regularity and
                    communicated well. As a matter of fact, I think I mentioned earlier that I
                    talked him into going on one of the telethons I put on raising money for the
                    Democratic Party. I told him to come on and say a good word about his own party
                    and that people ought to all participate in some way, and see if he could raise
                    a little money too on our telethon on our nickel. He did, and he was an asset to
                    the program. It showed the parties were able to work together not just compete.
                    So our relationship was good. When Reagan got the nomination, I called the hotel
                    the night they picked George Bush, where George Bush was staying. I didn't think
                    I'd get him on the phone. I was just going to leave word to congratulate him,
                    but he answered the phone in his suite at the Republic Convention. I said, “What
                    the hell are you doing answering the phone?” He said, “We're just on our way
                    out. Bob, he's going to name me.” I said, “Well, I heard it on television.” I
                    said, “I was surprised.” He said, “I was shocked. Barbara and I were shocked.” I
                    think he said, “We heard it the same time you did.” Anyway, he was going to rush
                    over to be presented to the Convention. So later - I guess this was after he was
                    President - I was going to say that we had dinner with him that first night in
                    the White House, but that's after he became President. I just had a letter, a
                    note, from him this week responding to something I wrote to him about. So we
                    maintain a good...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, one of our interviews was interrupted when you had a
                        call from him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I take a great deal of pride in the fact that, even though I'm a
                    Democrat, I'm a strong partisan Democrat, I try to be reasonable and I try not
                    to be mean spirited - I don't think I am - and I try to be credible. I don't
                    make outrageous statements, as I did early in my career. Fortunately, it's given
                    me a great deal of personal pleasure and a good deal of professional success.
                    It's a good lesson we try to teach our young lawyers here. We've got 1,000
                    lawyers. Just before I came down to see you today I spoke to new partners we
                    have that have just been admitted to the partnership this month, to tell about
                    this firm and how we try to maintain civility in our efforts, in the way we
                    compete with other law firms and the way we represent our clients, and that it
                    pays off in the long run.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a little off the subject, but while we're here I'm
                        going to pump you for stuff. Have you noticed a change in attitude of the
                        graduates of law school? Are they more pugnacious? Do they get along as
                        well? Is there a different spirit?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: I think the first thing you notice is the percentage of graduates. It
                    used to be when I started practicing law, in my law class of 110 people, I
                    guess, we had one woman, and then we had two women for a while, and that was it.
                    Today over 50 percent of the law students are women, so this firm has a great
                    many women lawyers. I spoke today to this group of new partners - and half of
                    them were women. That's the biggest change. I don't think there's really much
                    difference. People say there is. But there was a time, even five years ago, when
                    an awful lot of these young lawyers thought they ought to try to get into
                    investment banking on Wall Street. They saw a pie in the sky. Today they realize
                    what I used to always tell them: “If you want to go be an investment banker,
                    that's fine, but practice law a few years if you like the law. Get that behind
                    you. You can always make a living practicing law if things go bad.” Well, it's
                    hard to convince people things could go bad. They've never seen a depression.
                    But these graduates have seen that, and now they realize they're fortunate to go
                    with one of the 25 or so leading law firms, any one of them in this country
                    today. There are a lot of good law firms in this country. I take great pride in
                    the fact that our law firm was just selected as the 12th most admired law firm
                    in the country, by about 3,500 corporate executives and corporate directors, by
                    their vote. I guess five of them are New York law firms, which we're not, but we
                    have an office there. My firm is an important thing in my life. Outside of my
                    family this law firm has been one thing I've cherished. When I leave every now
                    and then for an assignment in government or politics, some of the people always
                    think I may never come back, but the ones that know me best know that, as quick
                    as I can get loose from what I'm doing, I'm going to come back to the law firm.
                    I just had a discussion about that yesterday, as a matter of fact, with some
                    lawyers here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering whether there was a change in attitude at
                        any point that you've noticed, because so much in American business has been
                        focused on the bottom line recently. It's a win-lose situation. Good law
                        really shouldn't be that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: There's no question that the practice of law is far more commercial now
                    than it was in past years. To some extent that's good and to some extent it's
                    bad. We preach to our young lawyers that come here that there are several basic
                    values we have in this law firm and you've got to measure up, and intellectual
                    competence is not at the top of that list. There are other things that are;
                    character, ethics, service to clients. We preach that constantly. That's what I
                    spoke about this morning, before we started this interview, with the new, young
                    partners here. Before you get to be a partner in this law firm, you must have at
                    least seven years of non-partnership service during which period of time you're
                    graded, and it's hard to eventually get to be a partner. We may take one or at
                    most two out of one of our offices a year, so that means the odds are strongly
                    against becoming a partner in this law firm, and it's hard to keep people when
                    they see that the road is a long and difficult one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes competition or the desire to make a profit can
                        make for bad decisions.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: What we have to do and what we do all the time is even tougher than
                    that. What we really monitor all the time is most of our lawyers bill by the
                    hour and put down the hours they spend on clients' work. They write that down
                    themselves. It's on the honor system except that we monitor it because it's
                    awfully easy for a lone lawyer who is striving to become partner to add two
                    hours to this client and two hours to that client that he really didn't work on
                    their business but it makes them look like they're more productive, more
                    productive compared to the other young lawyers who are competing for
                    partnership. One of the things we concentrate on very hard and monitor very
                    carefully is the issue that that kind of practice doesn't take place. Section
                    groups monitor offices by sections, the time spent and time charged to clients
                    to be sure that it isn't abused. It's very easy for a young lawyer to think,
                    well, this doesn't hurt the firm. They're just going to get paid for two more
                    hours of work, and the client can afford it. They're a big, rich company, and I
                    need it for my career. It's very easy to think that way. It doesn't mean that
                    they're evil or that they're dishonest, but it is dishonest and that's what we
                    preach. My judgment is that most first-rate firms do something similar.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you were offered the ambassadorship to Russia and
                        between that and the Kissinger Commission on Central America, did you get
                        involved in anything else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I served on a number of boards of public institutions and private
                    companies. But there was a long span. When I went to the Soviet Union in '91, at
                    that time, keep in mind, I was in my 70s and I certainly thought my public
                    career was over, long over, and I didn't want to go, as I told you earlier, but
                    it turned out to be one of the richer experiences in my life and in my wife's
                    life that neither of us expected. It opened many new doors for me. Some years
                    ago, Charles, I said to people in the press, “Now, I'm tired of being the
                    Democrat you turn to for a quote.” I wanted to get out of the press, because I'm
                    quotable and they know it, and I always return the press' calls and they know
                    that, so I said to them after I came back, “I don't want to be quoted anymore.”
                    I also said to a number of reporters, “If you have an important issue that you
                    really need, then call me and I'll do my best, if I have anything to say, to say
                    it.” So I cut back my public exposure dramatically and even hurt some feelings
                    of some press friends of mine. I didn't not return their calls, but I'd return
                    them and say, “I just don't want to talk about that,” and I'd repeat what I just
                    said to you. But, interestingly, within the last month of so, a number of things
                    have come up, everything from the success the Republicans have had in the manner
                    they've taken power and changed the whole power structure in this town. That is
                    important, and so I found myself, I think the week before last, two days in a
                    row on the front page of the New York Times with quotes. It's something I hadn't
                    planned on happening, and I don't mind it as long as it doesn't look like I'm
                    straining for it, and, happily, they turned out to be sensible quotes.</p>

                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Exactly, and so I'm very careful, but they turned out to be very
                    sensible quotes, and I had any number of people call and say, “I saw your quote.
                    I'm so glad...,” this, that and the other. What it really did, I think, was let
                    a lot of people around the country know what happened to Bob Strauss, that he's
                    still alive and kicking, and I like that. I don't want people to think I'm dead
                    or that I'm not working anymore. So it turned out well, but now I'm going to
                    shut it right down.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape six, side one with Ambassador Strauss. We are
                        using a different tape recorder this time, so we will see how this works.
                        Mr. Ambassador, we left the last time when you were in, could you tell us
                        how this appointment to Moscow go, and when did this happen and come
                        about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: One day I got a call in my office from an old friend who was Secretary
                    of State, Jim Baker. He said, “Bob, come over and have lunch with me today.” I
                    said, “Jim, I can't today. I have a date already.” He said, “Well break it and
                    come over here and have lunch with me. I need to talk to you.” I said, “Jim, I
                    don't break dates. If I can be with you, I don't like to break dates.” He said,
                    “This is important, very important. I promised the President that I would talk
                    to you about a matter before he gets back in town from a trip he is on. He will
                    be back in mid afternoon, and he is going to want to talk to you.”</p>

                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: George Bush senior. That piqued my curiosity, so I said, “Well I will
                    cancel it and come over.” I went over and sat down. We had a nice lunch. Before
                    we got really started I said, “What the hell is this all about.” He said, “Well,
                    you know we have been looking for an ambassador to the Soviet Union for over a
                    year, and nothing satisfies the President. He called me this morning about seven
                    o'clock and said, 'I have got our man; now all we have got to do is land him.”'
                    I said, “Well what can I do to help?” He said, “Well, you can accept. You are
                    the man.” I said, “Are you out of your damn mind, and is the President out of
                    his damn mind.” He said, “No, he said he had been thinking about it and didn't
                    know why he didn't think about it earlier. You are a perfect person to go for
                    him. You know Gorbachev.” I said, “I couldn't consider that. I am in my
                    seventies, as is Helen. It is just not something we can think about.” He called
                    in the woman who worked for him, did his press stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Margaret Tutwiler.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Tutwiler.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have interviewed her.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, she is splendid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Boy is she professional.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, she is a real pro. I said to them after I, Bush knew, I mean Baker
                    knew that Margaret and I were good friends. I had been helpful to her, and she
                    has been helpful to me. So he had her come in as we were having lunch. The three
                    of us talked about it. I just really didn't seriously consider it. I remember
                    Baker saying to me, “At least you will go over and meet with the President about
                    it.” “Well of course I would. I didn't want to be arrogant about it. I just
                    think I am the wrong person. I don't know much about Russia. I don't know
                    anything about this. I am too old. Baker said, “Fine.” So at three o'clock that
                    afternoon I went over to speak with George Bush. He told me how much he wanted,
                    he said he wanted me to do this. I told him I couldn't consider it. He pushed
                    some more, a long meeting. I was uncomfortable saying no to a President. Finally
                    I said to him, “Hell Mr. President,” keep in mind George Bush senior who was
                    president then, and I are old friends. We chaired our respective parties at the
                    same time. We were very close, good close friends, very good friends. Anyway, I
                    finally said, “Hell, Mr. President, I didn't even vote for you. You don't want
                    me.” He looked back and said, “I cannot believe you voted for that other
                    fellow.” I said, “Damn sure believe it because I did. I didn't have a bit of
                    trouble. I never considered voting for you.” I laughed and he laughed. He said,
                    “Well you just blew it, Strauss.” I said, “Why?” He said, “You are the only
                    person since I have been president who sat in that chair at this desk and looked
                    me in the face and said he didn't vote for me. Now a lot of them sat there and
                    said they did. I know that, but you are the only one who had enough guts to say
                    he didn't and do it with a smile.” So he said, “Now I know you have to go over
                    there. I need somebody over there who can do business with Gorbachev.' That
                    would have been his theme. He needed it. He said, “The limit to what we can do
                    over there now; we don't have a budget; we don't have this; we don't have that,
                    but if you know, you have been in Europe a lot. You have worked in Europe, and
                    you know the heads of the government in most of those countries. The signal that
                    you are leaving at your age and stature in life, station in life, that you are
                    going to Russia for me will send the right signal. We are serious about really
                    helping the Russians. It will really send the right signal to President
                    Gorbachev.” So he said, “Tell you what. Why don't you and Helen come to Camp
                    David with me for the weekend. We will talk about it.” I said, “No, Mr.
                    President, I wouldn't consider doing that. That place is too seductive. You get
                    up there; you can't use your good judgment. There is no chance. I have got to
                    stay here.” We laughed some more. He said, “Think about it overnight. Let me
                    call Helen. I will talk to Helen about it.” “Don't call Helen; I will talk to
                    her about it.” He said, “Let me talk to Helen,” and told his secretary to get
                    her on the phone. I said, “Not now. Give me 24 hours on this.” I was worried
                    about Helen saying, agreeing to anything he asked her to do. But anyway we had a
                    couple of meetings over there, and I finally decided I ought to go. Larry
                    Eagleburger and Brent Scowcroft both had considerable influence on me. I ran
                    into them in the hallway when I went in for my second or third visit with the
                    president. Eagleburger said, “You know, Strauss, the main reason that you ought
                    to go is it does send a signal. Nobody else is sending it as well as your going.
                    People have more background more knowledge, but this sends a signal and it will
                    be well received. So I eventually before that week was out, I called him and
                    said that, told the President I would go. I said, “I just have two conditions.
                    One is that Helen goes with me, and the second is that I can take Vera Murray as
                    my assistant. She has done everything with me for so long.” He said, “Strauss,
                    if Vera won't go with you, I don't want you over there. You can't work without
                    her.” We laughed some more. That's how the appointment came about.</p>

                        now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, we had to be talking about this was very early '71.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '81.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: '81 yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, not '81, '91.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: '91.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Boy, this shows our joint ages here that these decades
                        sort of get, yes, '91. Prior to this in '91, what had been your contact with
                        sort of European leaders, particularly Gorbachev. We are still talking about
                        the Soviet Union.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I had, Nancy Reagan had called me to get an invitation to sit at the
                    table with Gorbachev when Gorbachev made his first visit over here. I have told
                    you this story about going upstairs at the White House. We discussed Don Regan
                    and the fact that she wanted to get rid of him and wanted me to convince the
                    president he needed to do it for his own political survival. That is on tape
                    here we have. She, you remember the last thing I said in there when I sat down
                    at the table with Gorbachev with that big state dinner and all those Republicans
                    in the room. I knew a thousand people in there who wanted to be sitting next to
                    Gorbachev, one of the leading Democrats in the country, how stunned they all
                    were. So I had met him then and I had spent a little time with Gorbachev on that
                    visit. Later I had, the office had come over. No, I hadn't seen the office; I
                    hadn't gotten to know the office then. So that was about the only thing I
                    had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you met Gorbachev at that time, was he at all
                        interested in the American political situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: He knew a good deal about it form our conversation, mostly our dinner
                    conversation that one night. I don't remember having any other...</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just wondering whether you had the feeling, as you
                        say he knew, he understood. The fact that you were a Democrat was
                        important.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh yes, he understood very vividly. I had been to Russia and had dinner
                    with him, a small dinner of about 12 people in connection with the Russian
                    Business council. I had gone over with about a dozen business people who were
                    doing business in Russia at the time or trying to. So I had that evening with
                    Gorbachev, a small dinner. So I had limited experience, but it was something,
                    and it got press. So President Bush knew about it. I liked Gorbachev a lot then.
                    Everyone did. Gorbachev was real I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I recall just being on the street by happenstance, and all
                        of a sudden this limousine came by and there he was waving at everyone. I
                        mean he seemed to be having a delightful time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: An amusing the story, he stopped right, the traffic, got out and greeted
                    people. It happened to be in the building where Duke Ziebert had his restaurant,
                    Duke's. I used to eat in Duke's regularly, and the mob around there. I said
                    later to Duke, “You know why he stopped here and got out and all the people got
                    around him?” He said, “No, why?” I said, “They had planned to go in and have
                    lunch there and all these people got around him and were saying, 'whatever you
                    do, don't eat that lousy food in that lousy place.”' Duke didn't think that was
                    as funny as I did, but we had a good laugh out of it. But anyway, I had another
                    condition on that for the President. I said, “You know, my daughter, our only
                    daughter is approaching the age of 40 or is 40, and she is pregnant. My wife is
                    not about to leave here until that baby is born the first of September.” I think
                    I said the first of September, something like that. He said, “We can work that
                    out. I know you are not going to go without her.” I said, “No, I am going to
                    stay here with Helen on that.” So he didn't have any trouble with that. Strange
                    that story didn't break. Bush called a press conference which he had out in the
                    garden there and had a couple of hundred press people show up for it. They
                    didn't know what it was about. I walked out. He announced that I was ambassador
                    to the Soviet Union that morning. It was a big story for a lot of reasons.
                    Number one, our relationship with the Soviet Union then, primarily here is a
                    leading former Democrat, who was one, being offered and accepting a job as
                    ambassador to the Soviet Union in this Republican administration. So it made for
                    a good story. It was very well received. The press has always been kind to me,
                    overly kind. I am about the only fellow I know in public life who never cusses
                    the press. They have always been generous with me, overly so. Helen and I
                    started to get ready, and one thing we needed to do was take some Russian
                    lessons and briefings over at the State Department. So I started getting
                    briefings with various people at the State Department on Russian, Soviet issues.
                    I also started language lessons; Helen and I both did that with a very good man
                    that they provided. The time came for our summer vacation. We always spent about
                    a month, half of July and half of August, most of August out on the west coast
                    in a little cottage we have out there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Del Mar, California. So Helen and I had been out. I had the man, the
                    language tutor, come out at my expense, not the government's, and stay there for
                    two weeks to give us both some intense Russian lessons. Two or three hours in
                    the morning. That is wearing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the military and other groups tried to oust
                        Gorbachev.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Tried their best, exactly. In fact they took him physically. I guess he
                    was in his home on the Black Sea there when they took over the home and stayed a
                    house prisoner of theirs. So the phone rang. We were out for dinner with our
                    tutor as a matter of fact. When we got back the phone was ringing. It was the
                    White House calling saying that this coup had taken place. The President wanted
                    me over there the next day, to leave the next morning. It was 9:00 at night I
                    guess, when the phone rang in California, so midnight here. It was Brent
                    Scowcroft who said the President wants you to come in tomorrow and stop and pick
                    up Jim Baker, Secretary of State Baker who is fishing in Wyoming or Montana. I
                    forget which. They can pick him up and bring you all back here, and you can get
                    the last briefing and get sworn in. I had been sworn in, I had already been
                    confirmed by the Senate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assumed there was no problem there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: I had no problem at all. So we did that, but Helen didn't go over. I
                    went over without her, and stayed about five or six or seven days. About that
                    time the baby was born. I rushed back home to be with my daughter when she had
                    her child, and stayed there a couple of days. Then Helen and I went back
                    together. A funny story happened when we went back. We got there, and of course
                    tanks were in the street. We flew overnight to get there, and then the drive in
                    the morning, worn out. It was a sight, bombs everywhere, tanks still in the
                    street, Gorbachev still in captivity. They call house arrest captivity, and he
                    did. I remember I went straight to the embassy and met with the staff. Jim
                    Collins was out there, my deputy. I hadn't known him before, but he was very
                    highly recommended by everyone. I had just met him; I had no experience with
                    him. They suggested that rather than stay at the residence for the ambassador I
                    ought to stay in the compound at Collins' house which I did. We started to work.
                    The first thing that happened when I got there, Collins said to me, “The staff
                    is here. They have been waiting. They are waiting for instructions and advice.
                    The White House has called, and they are waiting for your impressions.” I
                    thought to myself this is a nice start for a fellow who doesn't know anything
                    about Russia and even less about the Soviet Union. I said to somebody there,
                    Collins I think, I said, “Why don't you see, I am sure we won't reach him, but
                    why don't you see if you can get through on the phone system and we can get
                    Ambassador Dobrynin.” Who you are going to call, and he was the longest serving
                    ambassador to this country, represents the Soviet Union and was a key player I
                    think. As a matter of fact, I think Ambassador Dobrynin had much to do with
                    keeping Russia, the Soviet Union and the U.S. from coming to grips with each
                    other. It was the kind of communication they our presidents had with the Soviet
                    Union through Dobrynin who told each side what they need to hear to keep then
                    from each other's throats. I'll be damned if two minutes later, you rarely get
                    anybody on the phone in those days when you tried because the system wouldn't
                    work, and the phone books, but I'll be damned if in two minutes they didn't have
                    Anatoly Dobrynin on the phone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By that time Dobrynin had moved. He was part of the
                        Politburo at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes he moved back. He had given up his ambassadorship to this country.
                    He was very close to the government but not in it. I said, “Anatoly,” and he
                    started laughing, sort of chuckled the way he did. “I thought I would hear from
                    you, and I am glad to hear from you. What can I do for you?” I said, “Anatoly, I
                    have got to tell our government, give our government some advice on how to play
                    this thing. You know, I don't have to tell you, I am going to have to get that
                    good advice based on other people's judgment better than mine. I would like to
                    know what you think I ought to do.” He said, “Bob, the best thing to do is do
                    nothing. I think in 48 hours this coup will all be over. It has no leadership.
                    What little leadership it has, they are petrified and drugged.” He just was very
                    critical of the whole thing. He said, “I think the best thing you can do is
                    nothing.” That made more sense to me than anything. I went up and told Jim
                    Collins that. He said, “I think he is exactly right.” That is what we did. I
                    called and talked to Jim Baker as I recall. It could have been Brent Scowcroft.
                    I think Baker had gone back out on his vacation, maybe he hadn't. Anyway I
                    called either Baker or Scowcroft or both. I remember talking to Scowcroft. I had
                    a long relationship already, and gave him that advice, the best thing to do is
                    nothing. He approved course B. The best advice I could give him, don't say
                    anything; don't do anything. Let it play out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well this is like the three ton elephant. If you start
                        tramping around you often do more harm than good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh yes, no question about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to go back just a bit. When you got together,
                        I mean here is a coup. You go to the White house. What was the impression?
                        What was the mood and the analysis that you were getting from the people in
                        the White House about what the hell was happening and what did this
                        mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: They obviously were terribly concerned about it, and the best advice
                    they had was that these people simply despised Gorbachev and his reforms, and
                    would do their utmost to get rid of him. But they had serious doubts that they
                    would end up successful, be a successful coup. As a matter of fact, that very
                    day while we were talking, a group of people were going down and thought they
                    could get access to Gorbachev to talk with him, people representing various
                    institutions in the government including several ambassadors, a couple of
                    ambassadors from foreign countries. I was to go. I hadn't been there, but I was
                    on their list to fly down and see him. Jim Collins was to go, my deputy in my
                    place. But there was - consternation is not a strong enough term. There was no
                    panic. George Bush was very calm about it, very cool about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get the feeling that this was a, I mean obviously
                        you knew most of the players, but did you have the feeling that here was a,
                        in foreign affairs here was a White House with a president that really
                        understood situations, when to let go and when not to. I mean you know, in
                        other words, a White House that was comfortable with the crisis.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, I guess I would agree, that is right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't want to put words in your mouth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I think that is right. I think George Bush was, generally speaking,
                    comfortable. You see, this was the second year of his presidency and going into
                    his third year really. He was comfortable, and he had good people. Jim Baker he
                    had tremendous confidence in. They both had confidence in Larry Eagleburger, the
                    Secretary of State and the deputy secretary respectively. Brent Scowcroft had a
                    world of experience and sophistication. So he had a first rate team at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, during this time, I mean this is before you went
                        out. There had been people in the White House, kind of within the staff who
                        tended to put their money on Gorbachev and in doing so, this is a staff
                        problem often sort of denigrating Yeltsin and all that. Were you picking up
                        any of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: No question there was a great deal of that there. There were people in
                    the Bush administration at the highest levels who did not want him to have
                    anything to do with Boris Yeltsin. As a matter of fact after I was appointed,
                    and before I served, went over to start my service, Yeltsin came to town. They
                    didn't want him to see the president. They were concerned it would send
                    Gorbachev. As a matter of fact Yeltsin couldn't even get in to, he was going in
                    a space bowl in Houston. They couldn't get him permission to do that. You could
                    drive in off the highway. If he had just driven in off the highway and not
                    asked, he would have been fine, but he asked, and they turned him down. I had to
                    call Brent Scowcroft. He said, “I'll take care of that. That is dumb.” He
                    arranged for it. So that was the time...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean this often picks up in a lower level. Policy can
                        sometimes be affected by people who are just closing doors and all
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh, not sometimes; frequently I would say, more often than that
                    sometimes, no question about that. There was a negative reaction to Yeltsin from
                    top to bottom, just sort of a left wing radical. You remember there was the
                    press saying at the time, they began to say that Bush was staying with Gorbachev
                    too long because Gorbachev is already beginning to get in trouble. Just about
                    the time I arrived Gorbachev was getting into trouble, so it was just beginning
                    that. There was no big story yet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you picking up before you went out there, was anybody
                        at the State Department or National Security Council saying power may be
                        moving you know. Don't discount Yeltsin.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes of course that was there, but people thought Gorbachev was a lot
                    more secure than Gorbachev was is a better way of putting it. And Gorbachev was
                    not as secure as he thought he was. Yeltsin was a major player already. What had
                    gone on after that, I think he had not shortly after he became president of
                    Russia. He may have been already.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just put this, in the Soviet Union there were presidents
                        of the various republics. Russia of course was the major republic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: The major republic. Yeltsin and Gorbachev at that time still on the
                    surface still had some semblance of cordial relationship, but it deteriorated
                    quickly. Keep in mind I am talking about August. By the end of the year on
                    Christmas Day, Gorbachev gave up his job. Yeltsin pushed him out of his job is a
                    better way of putting it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well Yeltsin had, I mean when you got there at the embassy
                        you were finding a different mood than say in Washington about this
                        Yeltsin-Gorbachev power relationship, because Yeltsin by the time you
                        arrived had already stood up on top of a tank and said no. I mean...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yeltsin was the popular figure in the country, no question about that.
                    An interesting thing happened about that. I guess it was about my third day
                    there or fourth day there. They had a big memorial service for three young men
                    who had been killed in the coup. One of them was Russian Orthodox; one was, I
                    think, Baptist, and one was Jewish. They had people from three different faiths
                    there at this big memorial service. When I went over there, Collins didn't go
                    with me. But Jim Billington of the Library of Congress happened to be in town,
                    and he went along with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Quite a scholar in Russian culture.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Great scholar, yes, and was very helpful in what to say when we had a
                    chance. When we got there, there must have been, hell I don't know how many
                    hundred thousand people. Biggest crowd I have ever seen. I would have estimated
                    a quarter of a million people they had in this big place. They had all the
                    ambassadors from various countries who were going to meet and sit together
                    during this service to show their support for Gorbachev, who had been out of
                    captivity now two days. When Billington and Vera and I and the security guys
                    started walking toward where the ambassadors were supposed to meet, there was
                    something way over towards the edge of part of that crowd, and I turned behind
                    and I looked around. I saw a flat bed truck with some type of microphone on top
                    of it. Just a flat bed truck out there, that was the stage. I said to Vera,
                    “Vera I think that is the stage. I bet you that is where things are going to
                    take place. I don't want to go over there and sit in the bleachers. The action
                    is going to be up on that truck.” I told the security people, “Let's go over
                    there.” I turned to some of the ambassadors and said, “Do you want to go with
                    me?” The Italian ambassador said he would like to go. So he and I and I think
                    Billington went with us, I am not certain. But we all went over towards that
                    flat bed truck. We got within 50 yards of it, and there were ropes. The security
                    people said, “These are ropes here, Mr. Ambassador.” I said, “Well lift the damn
                    rope up and let's go under it, or push it down and let's get over it.” I turned
                    to Vera and said, “Vera, this is just like a Democratic convention. Everybody is
                    in charge, and nobody is in charge, so if you act like you are in charge, you
                    will be in charge.” She laughed. Of course I was exactly right, and we then got
                    right up to the edge of the truck. There were a lot of security people there and
                    heavier ropes. We had the same discussion. I said, “Lift them up and go on.” So
                    we did. When I got to the end of that flat bed truck, the whole Russian power
                    establishment, what little there was left of it was back there. The first person
                    I saw, one of the persons was Gorbachev. I went over to greet him, and he
                    greeted me. Very warm, and he said he was glad I was there, that he had been
                    expecting me and was glad I showed up. I said, “Well so am I. Who is going to
                    speak here today, Mr. President?” He said, “Well, I am going to speak. The mayor
                    is going to speak, and each member of the clergy is going to speak for two
                    minutes. It will just be a 40 minute program,” something like that. Less than an
                    hour program. I said, “Well I would like to speak. I have a message from
                    President Bush” He looked kind of stunned and kind of said no. I said, “Mr.
                    President, let me tell you what is going on in this world and in your country.
                    People are wondering about you, what is going to happen to you, senior people
                    having just attempted a coup. Nothing could be as important to you as having a
                    representative of the President of the United States stand up and give you his
                    support for you as President of the Soviet Union.” His eyes lit up just as if a
                    light went on. He said, “You will speak just before me.” I said, “Thank you.
                    President Bush would like that. He wanted to show you his support and the world
                    his support.” So before a couple of more minutes had passed down came a kind of
                    a rope ladder. I found myself helping the clergy one by one get up and down on
                    the ladder and helping this one up and that one down. I laughed and said, “Vera
                    it is just another, I told you about the Democratic convention. You never know
                    what is going to happen next.” After a half an hour or so, less than that, I
                    spoke. I had a guy Hopkins who was my interpreter. He said he was a nervous
                    wreck. He didn't have time to prepare for this, but we had it all written out.
                    Collins had it prepared for me before I left the embassy. I had marked it up
                    some as we drove over, so it was a fairly scratchy three minute remarks is all
                    it was. Three or four minutes. But I remember getting up and looking over that
                    crowed and thinking hell his crowd is three or four times bigger than I have
                    seen in Times Square during the Democratic convention. We got through it, and it
                    was played over and over on CNN and other networks around the world. It was very
                    meaningful to Gorbachev. The White House was tickled to death. I talked to Brent
                    Scowcroft. I don't think I talked to the President then. They were delighted
                    that we showed this U.S. support. So my ambassadorship was launched in a very
                    positive way.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if something here, I wonder if you could talk a
                        little about your working relationship with Vera. She is here today, and
                        here I think it should be for the record.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, I thought we covered this earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think maybe we have.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, let's do it anyway. It will be covered twice. When I took over,
                    became treasurer of the Democratic National Committee in Washington in 1970, it
                    was a mess. Fred Harris had been chairman and had no discipline, none, and the
                    staff had none. It was a shambles. They were poorly trained. They were nice
                    people. Some of them were and some of them weren't, but it was obvious we had to
                    get rid of a lot and better utilize and order what was there. About the second
                    or third day I was there, this lovely woman whose name is Louise Roberts, had
                    been Fred Harris' secretary I think, or she had been with Pat O'Connor who was
                    treasurer, his secretary. She was my secretary and I said, “Louise, who is that
                    woman on the switchboard out there? She is the only person out here I have
                    talked to that has any sense.” Louise came back in a few minutes and said, “Her
                    name is Vera Murray. She is a temporary employee here; she is filling in.” I
                    asked her to come back. I said, “Miss Murray, I need to talk to several hundred
                    people in the next weeks, important people, difficult to reach. I need someone
                    who knows how to talk on the telephone. You are the only one I have seen around
                    here that looks to me like you have a talent for that. How would you like to
                    come back here and work for me?” She sort of in a suspicious way said, “Well
                    what would be expected of me.” That was about the time we had the scandals with
                    secretaries who couldn't type. She said, “You know, I am not a secretary. I
                    don't take shorthand. I don't type.” I said, “You won't be expected to. It is
                    probably not what you suspect would be expected of you. I would expect you to
                    talk to people for me and get me in touch with them in a professional way.” I
                    said, “Why don't you try it for a few days and let's see if it works out.” She
                    said, “Well, that is fair enough. I can do that.” Well then it was a few days
                    job, and it is 30 odd years and we are still together, been everywhere
                    together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, when you got to the embassy, who did you find
                        were the major players from your point of view in support and all at the
                        embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, Jim Collins, my deputy, was in a different class than any of the
                    rest of them. There was nobody in his class. I don't remember the other's names.
                    There were staff people around there. If I took time I could dig them out. They
                    were, there was a fellow named Ken Yalowitz I remember who went over and ended
                    up being ambassador to one of the smaller republics after the breakup of the
                    Soviet Union. Several of the fellows were very able. I had a lot of talented and
                    able people around there. So we add names. We had a very substantial CIA
                    operation there that kept to itself that we were responsible for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking about this, I mean obviously this is an
                        unclassified entry, but various ambassadors have had various relations with
                        the station as the CIA establishment is called abroad. In general terms how
                        did you find your support there and its performance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well I was unable to really pass judgment on their competence because I
                    didn't have an opportunity to grade them carefully. I thought that they were
                    fairly good. I never had tremendous confidence in them. I used to go back in
                    their shop they had there, the offices they had in their place. I did it
                    frequently and used to tell them the telephone system was so poor around there,
                    they had a better telephone system... They were nice people. We didn't really
                    monitor them. I got along with them fine, but they didn't ask for anything they
                    shouldn't have, and I didn't volunteer anything I shouldn't have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am just wondering, you are looking at this when you
                        arrived there, was there a sense of God, I mean this whole structure that we
                        have dealt with for the past 50 years or so was coming apart, or was this
                        looked upon as well this is one of these glitches, and we are going to end
                        up coming back to sort of the old Soviet-American relationship?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: I don't think there was any question in anybody's mind that it was going
                    to be very tough to hold the Soviet Union together. There was a general feeling
                    that Gorbachev's time was limited. There was criticism in this country that Bush
                    was staying with Gorbachev too long, too close to him and trying to conduct
                    personal diplomacy instead of nation diplomacy. Those were the kinds of things
                    that were going around. I guess I saw Gorbachev every couple of days, which was
                    amazing. No other ambassador did. I did for two reasons. The primary reason was
                    I represented the United States of America. The second reason was he liked me.
                    We got along; we spoke the same language. I came nowhere near a peer of his, but
                    well a person of stature in his own country, and he treated me that way. As Bush
                    said to me at the time he sent me over there, “I am sending you over there for a
                    particular reason, to establish the kind of relationship, warm with Gorbachev,
                    that he needs - that he talks straight to you and you talk straight to him, and
                    that if he speaks to you, he is speaking to me. That is what I need
                    desperately.” He said, “We have had an ambassador over there who is a splendid
                    ambassador, but he will never have the kind of personal relationship with
                    Gorbachev that you will have.” Of course he was a fine ambassador who preceded
                    me, a career man who knew more about the Soviet Union in his little finger than
                    I knew in my whole body, but he wasn't a particularly personable fellow in terms
                    of relationship. Jack Matlock was his name. I don't know him very well. Whenever
                    I saw him he was always courteous, and I was too. A disappointment came up. I
                    called him. Of course, I had no background over there. I said, “You know my wife
                    really doesn't know anything about this job. The call is to see what we need to
                    take over there, sheets, food? What are the demands made on her?” He said, “Well
                    my wife is very busy now and doesn't like, she is busy with her photography. I
                    will have her call.” I said, “Fine.” She didn't call, and I called him again in
                    Russia a few weeks later. He said, “I have talked to her, but she just doesn't
                    have time. She is tied up with the fact that we are going to be moving in a
                    month or so, and she has a lot of her photography that is taking a big part of
                    her time.” I thought to myself this is the nuttiest thing I have ever heard. She
                    never talked to my wife or me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is unfortunate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: An interesting thing happened on that. Tom Watson who was head of IBM
                    and was ambassador there for awhile...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he had been put in there by Carter, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I guess he had, by Carter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think the idea was somebody who was a businessman and
                        maybe this is time to do business.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: That is exactly right. But anyway, I got a call one day from his wife
                    that I knew had been with him. He and I talked and then she called and said,
                    “Mr. Strauss, I just returned from Russia recently, and they insisted that we
                    stay at the embassy.” She said, “The sheets were torn, weren't clean. I hated to
                    put my head on the pillow case. It was ragged and dirty. You better tell your
                    wife not to count on much of anything over there. I think the ambassador's wife
                    has let this thing run down there terribly. I was sorry we spent the one night
                    there.” So we bought a bunch of sheets and pillow cases, everything you can
                    think of and brought them over. I will never forget that lovely lady.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A question, sort of a broad one, but one of the things I
                        have noticed in my interviews that often is lost, and that is a political,
                        and I emphasize political, not just a career person who maybe sold
                        automobiles but somebody who has been involved in politics can often
                        establish a rapport with leaders, maybe quite diverse systems, but no matter
                        how you do it, the leadership is political. Did you find when you were
                        talking with Gorbachev, and later on that your political experience sort of
                        kicked in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I think that is an understatement how important it was. It was important
                    to Gorbachev. With Yeltsin it was of vital importance in helping Yeltsin plan
                    his trips to this country and state visits, things like that. We will get into
                    all that. I probably ought to move into that. A couple of stories. When Helen
                    and I came back a couple of weeks later, after I went home and stayed about a
                    week. The baby was born, and we came back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the baby a boy or a girl?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: A girl, thank you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we should allow you to get on, does it have a
                        name?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, Natalie Strauss is now, I guess, 11 years old, Breen, and the apple
                    of my eye I might add. She is the youngest of our seven grandchildren. Anyway,
                    when we went over there, Helen concerned about the whole venture. Not frightened
                    but concerned. We got to the Spaso House, the ambassador's residence. Before we
                    could get across the threshold, one side, the big double doors swung open just
                    like a scene out of an opera. There were about six or eight servants on one side
                    and six or eight staff on the other side. The man greeted us in a tux. He said,
                    “Mr. Ambassador, Mrs. Strauss, may I present the staff.” He did, one by one. We
                    still had the luggage and the security guy and everything behind us. We hadn't
                    gotten in there yet. He said, “I am sorry I did this so poorly, but,” his name
                    was Angelo, he was Italian, but he said, “Mario,” I think his name, “always did
                    this. I have never done it before. That is why I did it so poorly.” I said, “You
                    did fine, but I expect to see Mario,” whatever his name, something like Mario.
                    “I expect to see him. Everybody told me he had run this house perfectly, and I
                    didn't have to worry about it, and he would know how to do everything.” He said,
                    “He is dead.” I said, “What happened to him? Dead?” I was stunned. I thought he
                    was going to say he was killed in the coup time. He said, “Well he was playing
                    cards and a man came in and accused him of having an affair with his wife and
                    shot and killed him and the fellow he was playing cards with sitting next to
                    him.” Helen's mouth popped open, mine too. I turned to Helen and said, “There
                    are two things. You have got all these worries. There are two things you don't
                    have to worry about here. You don't need to worry about me gambling or running
                    around with a wife.' That story cured me about gambling or running around with
                    somebody's wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did when you initially got there, were you looking for a
                        power center or was the idea that we were going to do everything we could to
                        show our support for Gorbachev and all, or were any hedging of the bets
                        looking at Yeltsin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: None. As a matter of fact, the press was already beginning to say, would
                    be critical of President Bush for being too supportive of President Gorbachev,
                    for staying too long with him. What we were worried about was we didn't have any
                    money to do a damn thing. President Bush was not prepared to go to Congress and
                    ask for a lot of money. They needed help. They needed food badly. They needed
                    other kind of support. We knew we couldn't give it to them, so we had to give
                    them more conversation than cash is the way I used to describe it. That was our
                    biggest problem doing something for them, making the Russian people feel like we
                    were doing more. When we had once sent some food over there, we took the food
                    that was left over from that Mideast Gulf War, all that canned food that had
                    been shipped, was shipped to Russia and Moscow and distributed. We didn't have
                    money to buy foodstuffs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was there this problem? Here we had been spending
                        trillions on defending against the threat of the Soviet Union. The Soviet
                        Union was beginning to look like maybe it was coming around to being, it had
                        supported us during the Iraq invasion of Kuwait and all. Why all of a sudden
                        was the spigot off, there was no money? What was the problem? How did you

                <p>STRAUSS: Well keep in mind this was a Republican administration. They were goosey
                    about the conservative wing of the party thinking they were doing too much for
                    those communists. They weren't prepared to take on a fight to fight for that,
                    and didn't, I might add. Our primary concern did not involve a lot of money. I
                    mean our primary thing we could do for them had to be things that didn't involve
                    a lot of money. We got legislation passed that didn't need much help from me, it
                    did some, but Senator Lugar had enough going for him. The first thing we were
                    interested in more than anything else was getting our hands on and getting
                    control of nuclear weapons that were scattered around in four different
                    republics over there, get them all in Russian hands, which we were able to do
                    and, interestingly, the Congress were a great help in that. They helped, now we
                    have trouble with them, but then they were our strongest supporters. But that
                    was the climate in which we worked. No one wanted to go to Congress and ask them
                    for anything of any consequence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well was the feeling that the conservative wing was so
                        anti communist that they couldn't envisage doing something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I don't think that is an overstatement. I think that is the responsive
                    statement. I know President Bush was intimidated to some extent by his right
                    wing as most Republican presidents are, just as the left wing intimidates
                    Democratic presidents. The right wing is structured. They have money and
                    organization and structure. They can crush you. In our party the left wing can
                    drive you crazy. They don't crush you; they buzz around you and sting and end up
                    as I said driving you crazy. They don't have the structure or the organization
                    or the money that the Republican right has.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would seem to be that ideological cohesiveness.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: No not at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During your early days there, were you getting any
                        indications or contacts with the Congress? I am not talking about something
                        beyond the presidency, but I mean this is part of your competence. Excuse
                        me. I want to stop this now, we are really talking about the first few days
                        you were in the Soviet Union at that time. So we will pick it up. I had
                        asked you a question about did you have ties to the political system in the
                        United States? We are talking about Republicans and Democrats, but Congress
                        of trying to get them to come along and understand, Gee things are really
                        happening here and let's not...</hi>

                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: That is a very good point. I came back to this country quite often to go
                    to Congress. I had more credentials, more credibility on both sides of the aisle
                    I think than others in this administration had. A lot of things we were working
                    on getting done, a lot of problems we had been solved for ourselves, I came back
                    and solved it. Whether it was a problem of Representative Snowe or senator this
                    or that, I had those kinds of relationships, and I came back here and lobbied
                    for various things. I forget what particular problem it was. I came back and
                    went before the republican caucus and the democratic caucus. I will never forget
                    when I faced the republican caucus Newt Gingrich came up to me and said, “I
                    think you are right, and I will help you. Anything you need over there, you call
                    me, and I will help you.” Now I had doubts about Newt Gingrich, but as far as
                    that went he certainly delivered for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have just one other question I want to put in, a sort of
                        philosophical one. Often a bureaucracy likes things, and diplomacy is
                        particularly bad in this form, likes the status quo. They know how to deal
                        with it. With the fast breaking thing, did you find that people were really
                        getting uncomfortable with things changing in something which we had been
                        used to since the days of Stalin. and I'll leave it at that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is February 26, 2003. Mr. Ambassador, let's talk. First, would you like to
                    talk about dealing with the political establishment in the United States because
                    you know, most of these senators and congressmen had sucked off the teat of
                    anti-communism for years? Russia was a great whipping boy and all this. Was this
                    a problem for you?</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: No question the statement you just made is 100% correct. But let me lead
                    into this whole thing by backing up just a bit from the statements I just made
                    about coming back to this country. To put it in proper context, while I
                    considered myself to be more agile and sophisticated than the foreign service
                    when it came to solving political problems in the foreign policy area with the
                    hill, I also had enough sense to know that while I had uniquely splendid skills
                    in that area, I did not have skills in foreign policy generally, and certainly
                    not in Soviet Union affairs. I was hesitant as I think I said earlier in this
                    tape some hours ago that President Bush sent me over there. His argument was, he
                    had two or three arguments when I was hesitant about going initially. One was
                    that he needed someone, when I was telling him I didn't know the issues, he
                    needed someone with a background in Russian affairs. He said, “No, you are
                    wrong. I need someone who for one can establish a real relationship with
                    Gorbachev, because he needs someone on the ground. Most of these things we can
                    help with from here, but the personal relationship I need with Gorbachev, you
                    can establish for me and for this country. That will be your strength. And the
                    fact that you understand the political process, that we won't get anything done
                    over there, we are going to have to have some legislative support. There is no
                    support for it right now to amount to anything.” So that was kind of the setting
                    in which I went over there. The truth of the matter is, simply stated is that
                    President Bush was right. I was a non-traditional ambassador to the Soviet
                    Union, and yet all the voids I had and all the negatives I had in that area, I
                    had some unique strengths in areas that he thought needed attention, better
                    attention than he could get with just another diplomat. So that is the setting
                    for all this. I knew that people steeped in U.S.-Russian, U.S.-Soviet affairs
                    wondered how in the hell he could turn it over to a rank amateur, or turn the
                    embassy over to a rank amateur. The answer to that is very simple. He had some
                    priorities where I had unique skills. Furthermore he knew that he could get good
                    help for me. One of the things he did, for example, was assure me when I said
                    that I would need the absolutely best number two man you have got, he said, “I
                    will give you the best we have.” That is Jim Collins who succeeded me later on
                    with one person in between as ambassador and probably knows more about those
                    affairs than anybody in the country. So with Jim Collins' help I did pretty
                    well. Collins has in his office now, he has a picture with his hair dark. Now it
                    is about the color of yours which is very grey. When I said, “Collins, is that
                    your high school picture you have there with that dark hair?” He said to me
                    recently his answer was, “No that was my dark hair before I met you, before you
                    arrived in Moscow.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I have talked to him and am going to get in contact
                        with him in April. Now, what about this Congress? I mean who were some of
                        the players and what did we want, what did George Bush want out of Congress,
                        and who did you see were the key people you had to deal with and the problem
                        people?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: George Bush knew, he felt like he didn't have any money to spend in that
                    part of the world. As a matter of fact he and Brent Scowcroft who was the
                    National Security Advisor both said to me, “One of the primary reasons for you
                    going over there, Bob, is as a signal that we really give a damn about this
                    country, because we are not going to be able to prove it with aid. We are not
                    going to have an aid program of any consequence, nor did they really try for one
                    I might add. But he said, “This had to signal people in Europe and around the
                    world. Most of the leaders of the world you have met and done some business with
                    over the years. They know I wouldn't send you over there, and you wouldn't go
                    unless you thought you could do something. This sends the right signal that we
                    care and we are going to be involved with you. I get more out of the signal this
                    sends.” I think it was Scowcroft once who said, “We will get more out of the
                    signal by sending you over there and you going if you don't do another damn
                    thing. It will be positive.” So this was the kind of climate we were operating.
                    Now keep in mind, my primary concern on the day I went over there was to first
                    help stabilize the Gorbachev government. But even more important was to get our
                    hands on the nukes, and get them gathered up. We had, I must say with
                    practically no help from me, because Nunn and Lugar didn't need it, we had the
                    Nunn and Lugar legislation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is Senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Exactly, and their legislation was aimed at getting the money and a
                    program together that would enable us to get our hands on nuclear material
                    scattered in four different countries including Russia and three other Soviet
                    countries. We did that successfully, they did. Sam Nunn and Senator Lugar
                    deserve a lot of credit for that. Jim Baker had a good hand in it, and I helped
                    him, so we all contributed, but the two senators played the leading role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now were there groups within the government, well
                        let's talk about first the legislature, congress, that saw everything saying
                        well these are just communists under a different name. They are trying to
                        snooker us. I mean were there some?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, there were a lot of them. Some of them were sincere, and some was
                    just politics and thought it played well back home. You have to kick somebody,
                    kick the dog, kick the communists. But generally speaking, Congress went along
                    pretty well. We didn't ask for very much, and I think that is one of the
                    failures, and I am a big fan of George Bush senior as you know, a good friend.
                    But I think one of the things they could have done is they could have asked for
                    more in terms of aid. They really needed aid; they were hungry over there. We
                    didn't do a very good job of putting an aid package together. We put stuff that
                    looked good but really didn't have much substance.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I sort of have the feeling that no matter what we
                        did, things were so chaotic at that point in the economic sense. I mean you
                        sort of had the communist leaders running around turning into capitalists,
                        absorbing all the money that came in anywhere and sort of looting
                        essentially the system.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I don't think there is any question that was done, but I also think that
                    there were a lot of people hungry over there then and we didn't really have an
                    aid program. When I am talking about aid, I am not talking about economic
                    programs needed. There was enough structure there to get to build the kind of
                    economic programs they needed, but in terms of just food, those people were
                    hungry there. It was a terrible time. We could have done more, but I think the
                    times didn't permit President Bush to do much more than he did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We talked about us, but what about western Europe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Germany of course. Germany did more than any of us I suspect. They had
                    their next door neighbor. It was an easier sale for them. They had economic
                    interests that were far bigger than ours at the time. They were doing a lot of
                    business over there. I was always amazed when you would go to a hotel, I might
                    have mentioned this earlier. If you go to a hotel in France, you can register in
                    English or in French, but there is also a line in English that tells you what
                    line to write on. The same thing is true in Italy. But in Russia, when I went to
                    a hotel it was in Russian or in German, no English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you mentioned the Germans had economic interests. Of
                        course one of the charges that is laid on us, I am not sure it is
                        necessarily a bad one, but whatever we do is economically motivated. You as
                        ambassador, did you find yourself driven at all by saying we want to get
                        this concession or open up business here? How much was this a factor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: It really wasn't a factor then. We were really, every day trying to get
                    through that day without something blowing up. By blowing up I don't mean
                    exploding. A program that we couldn't get started or a program that was started
                    and abandoned. Little things like getting our American school going over there
                    was almost impossible. We finally got it done, but that was just a little simple
                    thing and that was something that we...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find either chaos or obstinacy in the Russian
                        bureaucracy or were they at sort of a standstill. They didn't know what the
                        hell to do and so if you don't know what to do, you don't do anything.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well you have to realize there was no rule of law. There was no legal
                    system that amounted to anything. There was no judicial system that amounted to
                    anything. There was no way to enforce a contract to try and do business. It was
                    a terribly difficult time. Nothing we would have done would have helped that in
                    the short run in my judgment. I was talking about aid. I think I told a story
                    earlier about our sending in a lot of food that was left over from the Gulf war.
                    I opened it in front of all the television cameras, peach pie or peach cobbler
                    or something. They expected to see potatoes and beans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those meals ready to eat, MREs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A question I put at the end of our last session that you
                        know in the Department of State or anything, it is a bureaucratic thing and
                        you are used to the way things are. All of a sudden after 50 years or so of
                        dealing with the Soviets all of a sudden the thing is blown apart. How did
                        you find people responding? I mean were they still sort of working on the
                        old assumptions? Did you notice a change around in dealing with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Of course there were dramatic interludes where there were dramatic
                    changes. There was a basic change of communism slipping away. There was a basic
                    change of the whole Soviet Union disappeared on us. There was a basic change of
                    Gorbachev was destroyed by Yeltsin and we start all over again with new people
                    and new initiatives. So to say it was complicated and messy is an
                    understatement. But with all that going on, we established some good
                    relationships. I don't know whether I mentioned this or not, but I was thinking
                    the other day again about the communication system in this country, and telecom
                    problems we have, the bankruptcies and big companies. I remember getting a call
                    from the chairman of Motorola, I may have told this story.</p>

                <p>STRAUSS: He said to me, “Bob, there is,” I had known him before. He is a fine
                    man. He said, “I am calling on behalf of our whole industry. There is a
                    communications conference. They are allocating spectrums in a big international
                    conference in Spain that is taking place in Madrid as we speak. The spectrum
                    have been allocated in this conference is not nearly big enough to take care of
                    our needs. Can you help? It had to be done in the next 72 hours. This conference
                    winds up in three days, to turn this around.” I said, “Good Lord, I don't even
                    know what you are talking about. I don't understand the issue, but I have people
                    here who will, and I will talk with them and see.” I said, “But I can't do this
                    just for Motorola.” He said, “No, I don't want you to do that. I want the U.S.
                    to get a big spectrum, a larger spectrum than we have. We need that. Once we get
                    the spectrum assigned to our country, we will fight it out among ourselves as to
                    who gets what allocation out of that. You get us the United States to get the
                    right allocation, a big enough spectrum. That is all you have to be for, not for
                    any one company.” I remember going to Yeltsin and taking a fellow with a
                    technical background with me who could explain. I couldn't even explain what I
                    wanted. I told Yeltsin what we needed. He had a spectrum much larger assigned to
                    them, and they hated it. We had one much smaller, and we did need a bigger one,
                    and he could get by better with a smaller one. He didn't understand what I was
                    talking about any more than I did truth is. They sent us to his person, Yeltsin
                    did, and told the fellow to try to help right there. Within two days, they
                    agreed to switch spectrums with us, and Yeltsin personally caused that to take
                    place. So in that sort of thing they were cooperative. Again, that goes back,
                    Bush wanted a personal relationship to get some things done. That was my primary
                    responsibility over there to establish that kind of relationship at the highest
                    levels in his government.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes. When I arrived, he was still being held by the coup plotters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you arrived, was anybody that you were getting
                        from our embassy, were we doing anything to thwart the coup?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: No. We hadn't even said what side we were on. As a matter of fact, the
                    Russians settled that themselves. I think President Bush and his team wisely
                    kept their mouth shut for a few days until we could see what to do. As a matter
                    of fact, I know, I am sure I have told this story in here, but I will repeat it.
                    But I remember arriving, being met by Jim Collins. As a matter of fact he drove
                    me to his residence I think it was. No I know it wasn't his house, the
                    ambassador's residence. I don't think it was even the main embassy, but whatever
                    it was, when I arrived and walked in that room, Gorbachev was being held by the
                    plotters. Jim Collins said to me, “I have gotten the staff together. We need to
                    make up our mind. We need to give them some guidance. What do we do?” I said, I
                    wondered to myself now, of all the people in the world to be picked to decide
                    what our country is going to do, I am maybe one of the worst. I said to Jim
                    Collins, “See if somebody can get Dobrynin on the phone.” I knew Dobrynin back
                    in this country, had dinner at the Russian embassy many times. He and I had
                    become friends. The Russian telephone system never works. There are no phone
                    booths. There weren't then. If you got through it was a miracle and it was
                    usually a wrong number. I'll be damned if the Lord didn't help because in 30
                    seconds this young aide out there came back and said, “Ambassador Dobrynin is on
                    the phone, Mr. Ambassador.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He at that time was part of the politburo wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, he had come back. I said, “Anatoly, Bob Strauss.” He laughed. He
                    didn't laugh, he chuckled, and said, “I have been expecting to hear from you
                    where are you?” I said, “I am right here in Moscow, and I want to tell you that
                    I have just arrived within the hour. My people and my government want to know
                    what is going on and what to do, any recommendations we have at the embassy. It
                    is rather strange for me to be calling on a Russian to help make this decision
                    but I need you. What should we do?” He said, “I will tell you what you should
                    do, Bob. Do nothing. I am privy to some things taking place, and I think if you
                    can keep from saying anything and doing anything for 48 hours, this might blow
                    over. These are irresponsible people who don't really know what they are doing
                    that have our President.” I said, “Thank you, Anatoly, that makes sense to me.”
                    I turned around to Collins and told him what it was, Anatoly said do nothing.
                    Collins thought that was very good advice too. That is what we reported to
                    Washington. That again is personal diplomacy, personal relationships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is very important at a critical time. I have to say
                        that the Bush administration showed a great deal of restraint. At the fall
                        of the Berlin Wall, George Bush didn't end up dancing on the ruins of it and
                        all, which is hard because normally the White House wants to crow. We did
                        this and all that which is always counterproductive in foreign relations. It
                        is hard in a way to control and discipline your staff to keep them from
                        running around and saying I caused the fall of the Soviet Union etc.</hi>

                <p>STRAUSS: As we are speaking, you and I today, in late February the Iraqi
                    situation is coming to a total boil now. I wish we had, I would be more
                    comfortable if we had Bush senior instead of Bush junior. Now there are things
                    Bush junior can do I am sure better than his father can do, but when it comes to
                    the world possibly going up in flames, I would like to have the cool, calm,
                    cautious Bush senior playing the hand for our country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now back to, when Gorbachev came back shortly
                        thereafter, the coup went down. you were sort of sent over at the time to
                        establish good relations with Gorbachev. What was the feeling that you were
                        getting from the people in your own sense? That Gorbachev was a finished
                        figure or were you kind of waiting for him to come back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I think people thought generally that Gorbachev was in the twilight. By
                    that I mean maybe he had two years or maybe three years, maybe a year. I don't
                    think anyone dreamt that his fall would come as quick as it did. There is no
                    question that that is what was thought. I thought he would last longer than he
                    did, as did my administration that I was working for, the Republican
                    administration. I remember when I spoke before this large crowd of people at the
                    memorial service there two or three days after. I think we have discussed that
                    already. I remember, I think I have it in our notes here. If not just put it in.
                    When I said to President Gorbachev when he greeted me behind that sound truck or
                    that truck they were using for a platform there. I remember when I said, “I
                    would like to speak; I have a message from the President of the United States.”
                    He said, “You speak? Why would you speak?” I said, “Mr. President, I can't think
                    of anything more important to you and the people of the Soviet Union and the
                    world than a message to you delivered to you by your ambassador, by Bush's
                    ambassador, a message from President Bush saying that the United States is
                    behind you. That would be the thrust of my remarks.” You could see a light turn
                    on in Gorbachev's confused head then because he was terribly confused still from
                    the captivity. I guess it was the next day or two days after that. You could see
                    in his eyes a light going on. He said, “You will speak right before me.” So that
                    was the climate there. We really were worried about getting him. We wanted to be
                    sure that he got re-established as head of that government. That was the first
                    concern. But did he think he was going to last forever, no. Did we think we
                    would lose him in six months, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a political observer, one reason why often professional
                        politicians or people who are quasi professional - I don't know what you
                        would call yourself - are better observers and able to deal with politicians
                        better than say foreign service people who you know, this isn't their world.
                        They report on it, but were you watching, looking at signs of change in the
                        Russian system. Gorbachev is back; Yeltsin had performed splendidly at the
                        time of the coup. How were you observing this power business, and what did
                        it hold for us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: You could see that Yeltsin, it was a very hard hand to play. Keep in
                    mind that two months before this, two or three months before this at the
                    most...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape seven, side one with Robert Strauss.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: President Bush strolled in the office informally, preplanned, of course,
                    where he could shake hands with Yeltsin, then head of the Republic of Russia,
                    not head of the Soviet Union of course, and greet him but not be caught with
                    him. The press reported he went to the White House and saw Scowcroft, not that
                    he went to the White House and had a visit with the President. President Bush,
                    obviously properly, was concerned that if he met with him it sent a wrong signal
                    to Yeltsin, to Gorbachev, because they were already jockeying for position. This
                    is long before the coup. After the coup that jockeying became, instead of
                    nuance, became open. Yeltsin started pushing and pushing for power. President
                    Bush, of course, was concerned about that, his people were. They hadn't really
                    established a relationship with Yeltsin. Jim Baker did a good job when he first
                    went over and dealt with him the first time. He was Secretary of State when he
                    went over. Yeltsin liked him almost from the get go. Yeltsin heard good things
                    about Jim Baker, I believe, because I saw Yeltsin regularly, and it didn't take
                    Baker long to show that he was even better than I was suggesting to Yeltsin. He
                    handled it extremely well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How, I mean you arrived; you already talked to Gorbachev.
                        We are concerned about the Yeltsin-Gorbachev relationship. Gorbachev was
                        sort of our boy you might say. But when you arrived, how did you establish
                        relations with Yeltsin, and how did that develop?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Very loosely and very casually. I did not really have a relationship of
                    any consequence with Yeltsin until he came to authority. I couldn't do that. We
                    couldn't get involved in that game going on between the two of them, so the only
                    thing I could do is nod in Yeltsin's direction from time to time. I was openly,
                    and we were openly pro Gorbachev knowing that his days were limited. Keep in
                    mind this coup was in August, and by Christmas of that same year Gorbachev had
                    resigned. The new Soviet Union was in the process of breaking up.</p>

                        at Yeltsin, because you know, there had been this thing particularly from
                        that Yeltsin visit of somehow if Gorbachev was our guy, Yeltsin was a
                        drunkard.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: They of course, were looking at him before I got there. There was a big
                    question about Yeltsin, you are exactly right. I used the term erratic. I think
                    I told the story about Yeltsin visiting in the Seaview Hotel. Duane Andrews
                    arranged for him to occupy one of his suites in that hotel. It turned out to be
                    his daughter's suite who was not there using it. Yeltsin got drunk that night
                    and went out in the water swimming at midnight the first night he was there and
                    got a little publicity around, more than we wanted, so he was a difficult fellow
                    to handle. That was before he came to power, before Gorbachev went out of
                    power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I mean during this time August through December, what
                        were you doing. I mean was there essentially a power vacuum at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: No, Gorbachev, to all intents and purposes, he was the head of the
                    Soviet Union. Now he was shaky, but he had me take the head of Kazakhstan who
                    was a Gorbachev man. He wasn't a Yeltsin man. He later became a Yeltsin person,
                    but many of the other presidents of those various republics were Gorbachev
                    people. Some of them were beginning to be Yeltsin people. Some were beginning
                    more and more to give up on Gorbachev as being the guy who could pull it
                    off.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: They controlled their own nukes. They had their own nuclear programs in
                    these separate republics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean these missiles were distributed as we had
                        distributed ours through the states.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Exactly.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But these were under government, I mean these places as
                        the Soviet Union began to fall apart, these elements within the Soviet
                        system turning into independent states.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: That is correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now were you seeing Gorbachev about saying while there was
                        still the Soviet Union in existence, were you seeing him about the
                        disarmament?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, and keep in mind, more important than me seeing him was Jim Baker
                    was spending a lot of time over there. It was far more impressive to have the
                    Secretary of State making demands than the ambassador who was delivering
                    messages from the Secretary of State, the head of our government. Baker had his
                    hands all over that, and Yeltsin liked Baker as Gorbachev liked Baker. But the
                    minute Gorbachev went, the pressure in the Soviet Union disintegrated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was December.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: It was Christmas Day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On Christmas Day the Russian flag went up over the
                        Kremlin.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: That's right, and at that time, I won't describe it as a mad scramble,
                    but there was a great deal of additional intensity that went into the program
                    that Jim Baker was leading. I went as ambassador assisting in getting his hands
                    on those units and also getting Yeltsin to commit, which he did. He was very
                    strong in his commitment. Jim Baker was very impressed as was George Bush with
                    what he produced.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that from Yeltsin on this issue, was he as
                        concerned as we were about the proliferation, or was this trying to be nice
                        to the United States during this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh I think he was some of both. Yeltsin knew he needed the United
                    States. Yeltsin gave a firm commitment to Jim Baker that he had control and
                    would keep control. I guess Baker relied on that commitment. He couldn't do
                    anything but rely on it; it was the best thing he had was Yeltsin's commitment.
                    I must say that to be sure there was no misunderstanding, Yeltsin, as Gorbachev
                    before him, delivered on that commitment in terms of nukes, nuclear programs.
                    They were gathered up properly. It took many trips by people back in Washington
                    and efforts by me and others in our embassy, but we got it done.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you seeing as this Gorbachev-Yeltsin thing, rivalry
                        went and it was beginning to move over toward Yeltsin. Were you seeing a

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh, sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the foreign minister at the time? Was it still

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: No, Shevardnadze was gone. He stayed in all the way, I will think of his
                    name in just a minute. He still comes over to this country all the time. He was
                    the foreign minister is what he was. He was Baker's counterpart. He was most
                    cooperative, very pro American by the way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you seeing a change in attitude in our embassy or
                        staff there? This is too serious to play the Cold War business and let's
                        get...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I think what you saw there is what you see in any bureaucracy. There is
                    a certain odor that comes before the death, and the odor was in his final year,
                    final months. As a matter of fact, I was back in the States to celebrate
                    Christmas with my family on the day Gorbachev left office and Yeltsin came in. I
                    never would have left my post out there if we had had any notion that that was
                    going to happen. As a matter of fact, very few of the heads of the republics
                    knew it was going to happen. But it did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the sounding that you were getting about within
                        Russia, well the Soviet Union at that time, about Yeltsin? Were there lots
                        of reservations about nomenklatura about, because we mentioned this erratic
                        business.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: He was a wild card as far as many of them were concerned. Keep in mind,
                    he had a personality; he had an image of being a great reformer, so he had a lot
                    of positive things about him as well as the negative aspect of somewhat erratic
                    behavior. He was relentless in his drive for power. When he got power he used
                    it. I say used it, that is a big term, but he liked that power and he had no
                    hesitance about making decisions. He was a good decision maker. Gorbachev was
                    far more a talker in many ways. I was and am a great admirer of him. He was no
                    longer effective, let me say that, as far as the Russian people were concerned.
                    So, though people had a question mark about Yeltsin, they were ready for a
                    change. When things are terrible, you are always ready for a change. Anything
                    would be better than what is going on.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you sort of open up your initial contact with
                        Yeltsin? I am talking about after December, he is in power. What were you
                        getting from George Bush, Jim Baker about how to deal with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: They were cautious, but they knew they had to establish a relationship
                    in a hurry, so I left my holiday in the States and went back to Moscow. I don't
                    remember the details, but I remember the first thing I did was let Yeltsin's
                    office know I wanted to come in and see him. Within no time it was granted. I
                    had a lucky thing there I may have explained to you earlier in this - I think I
                    did - that he came to this country shortly after I was appointed but long before
                    I was confirmed, and so things he did, I was included in the things he was doing
                    and got to know him pretty well. By pretty well, sitting next to him at two or
                    three dinners and talking and relating to him as he related to me. I think I
                    told you earlier in this he was trying to get into the Space Center in Houston.
                    I had to call Brent Scowcroft. He was anxious to see it. Scowcroft was National
                    Security Advisor. I called General Scowcroft and told him that it was the
                    craziest thing in the world, a stranger could walk off the street and go in
                    there, no security clearance of any kind required. We had this Russian who
                    someday could be head of that government. That was before he became head of that
                    government, but he was president of Russia, and he couldn't get into that
                    program. Scowcroft said, “I'll take care of it right now,” and he did. So that
                    was a big thing in Yeltsin's mind that I had gotten that thing done. He was
                    waiting, and almost as he brought up the problem, it was solved. He also was
                    friendly with, he had come to know Dwayne Andreas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dwayne Andreas being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: At the time he was chairman of the company Archer Daniels Midland. They
                    did a lot of business with Russia. He was reasonably well known in Russia. He
                    was close to and friendly with them. When Yeltsin came to this country, I don't
                    know, how he got in touch with Andreas or who recommended him, but Andreas, my
                    recollection is, loaned him an Archer Daniels Midland plane to get him around.
                    This is before he came into power, and Andreas provided him an apartment where
                    he stayed for a few days at the Seaview Hotel in Florida. I went down and saw
                    him there. So by the time he came to power, he knew Bob Strauss was a friend of
                    friends of his and that sort of thing. When I called to see him of course the
                    American ambassador is going to get to see him anyway. I could have been
                    anybody, but I had the advantage of having a bit of a personal relationship with
                    him. It grew. He was extremely fond of me by the time I left and I was of
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find, you know, did he grasp the complexities
                        of the situation? In other words you raise issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, he was very bright. He was very good at that, he really was. He was
                    a good listener as well as a good talker. He had good people around him. He was
                    a dynamic figure then. He was far more dynamic, I guess, at that time than
                    Gorbachev who was worn out. People were tired of him. This is a new face, and
                    this was the man who had saved the country from this coup. Remember the pictures
                    of him standing on this tank and all this stuff. So he had an image of, a hero's
                    image when he came into office. He knew how to take advantage of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were there, how about the KGB? How did they, I
                        mean, the KGB was the b�te noire of the American embassy, provocations,
                        enticements, you know the whole thing? I mean were you seeing a change?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes and no. After came in, we saw the more dramatic change when he
                    replaced a bunch of the older KGB types. There was a young reformer that came in
                    with him whose name I forget, but he reminded me of a Midwestern governor in our
                    country. He looked like it. He could have been governor of Indiana or Michigan,
                    that sort of thing. He was a tremendous strength in reforming. I remember him
                    saying to me after he and I came to know each other, talk some. I had fellow
                    named Bill Reardon who was a CIA head for that whole part of the world. He was
                    in an office in Germany. Bill Reardon, he is still around. He is not active in
                    the CIA, but he was one of the colorful figures. When he came to visit, I
                    introduced him to the head of the KGB. Bill said to me, “They really are trying
                    to reform this agency to some extent, but you know, God only knows what is in
                    those files, and I don't know when we will ever get to see them.” Interestingly,
                    that fellow who was head of the KGB, one day, called me to come over. He said
                    that he decided he had permission of his government to turn over all the
                    information on the wiretaps that they had planted while the building was being
                    built - a six story building was being built on our land there for our embassy
                    to occupy. He brought out what looked like two ordinary suitcases, old time
                    suitcases. In them there must have been 30 different listening devices. In the
                    other package were maps going everywhere. Every single one of those listening
                    devices was placed in the concrete of the building we were building there by the
                    Russian workers. They were KGB and were planting those things all over. I was
                    stunned. I didn't know whether to take it or not. I came back and called Larry
                    Eagleburger the Deputy Secretary of State. I said, “Larry,” and I relayed this
                    story to him. I said, “It seems to me I ought to take them,” but I didn't want
                    to take them until I got permission. He said, “Hell I don't know what to do. It
                    seems to me we are better off taking them than not taking them.” I told him that
                    is the way it seems to me but I didn't want to get out of line here. So I called
                    this fellow back. I can't think of his name, and told him I would be over the
                    next day and pick it up. We picked up the two big boxes, big suitcases full of
                    material. He invited me out to his dacha with my wife, and he had Shevardnadze
                    and their wives. He said to me, “What did you think of the material we gave you
                    yesterday.” I said, “I was stunned by it, but I wasn't surprised that you had
                    it, but I was stunned at what you did.” He said, “We are going to turn this
                    around, and that is a real demonstration of our efforts.” I came back and went
                    public with that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember it was in the paper. To me it was a great
                        indicator things were changing. It is always hard to turn, as I mentioned
                        earlier on, a bureaucracy does not respond well to sudden change.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Exactly, and I was trying when I went public with that, it was because I
                    wanted the American people to see. That was something they could really see
                    instead of a theory that things are changing. This was something very
                    constructive they could see and hold in your hand. I gave a speech at the press
                    club when I was back on a trip. I told that story. That is when it got the
                    publicity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, speaking of the embassy, where were you, I
                        mean for years there had been this conflict over we knew we built a new
                        embassy and we were sure the thing was bugged. We were talking about
                        destroying it and all this. Did you have to wrestle with this problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Constantly. We had trouble, you know, we were convinced that all those
                    bugs were dead. They only last so long. We wanted to use the building. People in
                    the Congress didn't want us to; there was a lot of objection to our using it. It
                    was just sitting there wasting, going to rot and ruin, and all that money. As a
                    matter of fact the head of the KGB, the new reformer said to me, “This will save
                    your country many millions of dollars. You don't have to rebuild a building; you
                    can use it. Here is a map of where all the bugs are placed. It will save you 50
                    million dollars. You are generous with our country, we can at least do this.” So
                    that was sort of the theme of that from the head of the KGB. I might add, they
                    fired him about three months later. Somebody over there changed their mind I
                    guess about him being so open. He had done it with Gorbachev's absolute
                    approval.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, speaking of the embassy and running it, as an
                        old hand who served five years in Yugoslavia, a communist country, what was
                        the situation with what we would call foreign service nationals? In other
                        words citizens of the country that worked in the embassy. These are usually
                        a great strength even in a communist country. At one point we were replacing
                        them with Americans. You know, to a professional foreign service officer it
                        sounded like nonsense. It sounded like political correctness or
                        something.</hi>

                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: It was Congressional demands. We couldn't employ locals. It cost us a
                    tremendous amount of money to bring an American worker who worked for Bechtel
                    Corporation, for Bechtel to bring a hundred workers over to work on our
                    projects. The expense of that was 20-1 over the expense of using the Russians.
                    One of the things we accomplished while I was there was I testified before the
                    senate and house committees that we ought to reverse that policy. The government
                    was willing, the executive branch was willing to do it finally, but the
                    congressional committees were opposed to it. So we finally turned them around
                    and we got permission to use in various non sensitive posts so to speak, non
                    sensitive jobs, Russian nationals instead of imported Americans. It was a big
                    savings of money, but I must tell you that within a month of the time that those
                    Russians started taking the place of our Americans, the KGB people were pushing
                    them to provide information. They were concerned what should they do. They were
                    frightened. So it was an unpleasant situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean those who have served in communist countries
                        understand this, and you learn to live with this. I mean these are good
                        solid contacts within the country who can give you ideas. They are not all
                        that much tool. I mean these are ordinary citizens who understand the
                        situation and have a certain loyalty obviously to their country, but also to
                        their job. It is a strength rather than a weakness as long as you understand
                        that you have got to be careful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Extremely careful. I can understand why there was hesitancy to let us
                    use Russian nationals, but I must tell you the minute we started using them, and
                    we were using them to mow lawns and keep the outside of buildings painted and
                    things like that, but as I said earlier, within 30 or 60 days of them coming to
                    work, the parties were squeezing these people over there for information.
                    Happily they didn't have any. Several of them reported those efforts. They liked
                    their jobs as you just mentioned. They didn't want to be involved in that kind
                    of business. But we got it done; it was worthwhile, and keep in mind, we had
                    tremendous budgetary problems. I think we had better quit.</p>

                        like to ask you about during the time you were in the Soviet Union/Russia,
                        did the KGB start picking up these provocations, tracking, following, you

                        our ability to get around and all that. We will talk about that. Also, could
                        you talk about the decision that was made because of financial things that
                        really fell at Secretary Baker's level, not to increase our State Department
                        budget to take care of all these new embassies that we were establishing. To
                        somebody like myself, this seemed like a horrible situation. Could we talk
                        about that? And then we will talk about the post December when the...</hi>

                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is March 5, 2003. Let's start with the KGB. You have already mentioned the
                    bugging of the embassy and being given that portfolio full of stuff. What about,
                    you know, you had KGB operatives, they had been doing this for 50 years, in a
                    relatively weak government. I find it very difficult to think that they would
                    all of a sudden turn into nice guys as far as we are concerned. In your
                    experience, how were they treating American diplomats and others? Were you
                    running across provocations? I mean was it still sort of the old game going on
                    by reflex or by intent.</p>
                <p>STRAUSS: It was dying off, but very slowly. For example, I came back here and met
                    with some Congressmen and Senators to get them to get over this idea that we
                    could not employ foreign nationals in our embassy for security reasons. Our
                    people in our embassy worked out a plan where we would use Russians for certain
                    tasks, repairing windows, mowing lawns, painting houses, all within the
                    compound, various types of work that didn't put them in touch with anything
                    related to security. The last person I needed to get was Senator Snowe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Olympia Snowe of Maine.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes. And she was helpful once I came back and talked with her. Her
                    committee had been blocking anything on this, but she was exceedingly
                    constructive. She promptly got on it and helped us work it out. So we then
                    started, let me back up and say bringing these Americans over there to work on
                    these tasks cost a fortune. First you had to pay them six times as much or ten
                    times as much as you would pay a Russian. You had their transportation; you had
                    their housing, all that. So it was a major budgetary item if we could save it.
                    So we replaced maybe 50 people which is big money when you do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. You consider I can remember way back, you
                        consider $30,000 just to pay somebody to be overseas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Heck, I think it cost $100,000 for a person over there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, well I was going way back.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: So we had, I guess, maybe 30 or 40, maybe less, Russians working within
                    the embassy compound. We cleared them security wise the best we could. We had
                    good people. They did good work. It hadn't been going on for about three or four
                    months until we began to get information that the Russian security people were
                    contacting them and trying to get this information, that information, the other
                    information. Interestingly, two of those people, I don't know how many were
                    contacted, but two of them came and brought us identical stories. They didn't
                    want to lose those jobs. The committed to something and they wanted to fulfill
                    their commitment. We had a heck of a time with that, but stayed on top of it,
                    and I think we finally worked it out pretty well. Now there are a great many of
                    the Russians working within the compound, and very successfully so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what about, it used to be on field trips or something
                        we were concerned about officers, you had to have two going out so the blond

                        Was that still going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I don't think we had that going on. I don't know that the CIA, I don't
                    know what their rules were or that they were in line. They were housed with the
                    ambassador in the same building and I was responsible for them, but I didn't set
                    their rules. They set that within their organization.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: No he wasn't. His identity was theoretically undisclosed.</p>

                </p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh it changed a great deal. As a matter of fact, I have a picture in the
                    next room of Bob Gates when he was head of the CIA meeting with Boris and the
                    head of the KGB and others around a conference table. That was '92. Boris was in
                    that picture. We had it when I, I think I mentioned earlier when the KGB turned
                    over to me this, the new reformer that had turned over to me this all these two
                    bags copies of where all the things were planted in our building. was trying his
                    best to be helpful there. I remember he said to me, “I know it is going to cost
                    you $75 million. You do your best to give us financial support and other things
                    which we desperately need. Maybe we saved you a little money if we give you this
                    and you can use that building rather than tearing it down.” I think they did
                    tear down must of it eventually, but they still saved several floors of it they
                    were able to use. He thought he was making it easier for us to use that building
                    instead of having to build a new one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, of course, you are running across the difference...
                        There is the political side, and then there is the professional spy thing.
                        Professional spies spy. The political types come in and go in both our
                        countries, but the professional spies stay on and they keep doing their
                        thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Also in both of our countries. When Shevardnadze and I were in a plane
                    together coming. I don't know why we were traveling together, but he was a good
                    friend. I was complaining about the intrusion into my privacy by the residence I
                    lived in as well as our offices all being bugged. He said, “Bob, I will tell
                    you, if you want me to I will bring you a whole basketful of U.S. made bugs that
                    we have taken out of our own buildings, so it works both ways.” I said, “Well
                    yes, I am aware of that.” He kind of shamed me a little bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we seeing, when did we realize the Soviet Union was

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I think we knew that in the fall of '91. What we didn't expect was that
                    Gorbachev would step down as early as Christmas, '91. I know our CIA people
                    didn't expect it that soon. We certainly didn't at the embassy. But everyone
                    knew Gorbachev's days were numbered. People thought they were numbered in terms
                    of years, not in terms of days or hours which proved to be the case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When all this was going on, I mean at the time things were
                        going through this massive change, what were you getting from your Russian
                        experts at the embassy, Soviet experts, about what brought about this? Was
                        it economics; was it American star wars pressure; was it ineptness of the
                        government? I mean what was bringing about this change? I mean what was the
                        conventional wisdom?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well all those things you mentioned had something to do with it, but it
                    was a combination of all those things. If the truth be known, the internal
                    pressure on the communist party, brought by Boris Yeltsin was what caused that
                    more than anything else. Now obviously Reagan's, everything he spent on dealing
                    with the Russians in a military way had to make them discouraged and make them
                    ready to give up to get a way out of that thing. But the differences you recall
                    between Yeltsin and Gorbachev was that Gorbachev thought, incorrectly, that he
                    could reform this government within the framework of the communist party.
                    Yeltsin thought he had to get rid of the communist reform. That is the reason he
                    had to get rid of Gorbachev. He was driven by that, and he was driven also by
                    his own ambition which was to be head of that government. He accomplished both
                    of them. I think there was a place for each within their own time. My judgment
                    is that history will make him one of the prime movers of change in the world in
                    the century.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened when the embassy was faced with the
                        dissolution of the evil empire using Ronald Reagan's terms, in '91/'92. What
                        was this doing to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Gorbachev and I always had a very comfortable relationship. I saw him in
                    an average week several times. I don't know of another ambassador that saw him
                    once a month, but the U.S. ambassador has a different role, particularly one
                    that he was comfortable with and he knew the President of the United States was
                    comfortable with who sent him over there. So he and I would talk about his
                    problems with considerable frankness. His problems with the government, his
                    problems with accomplishing anything. We talked also about his political
                    problems to some lesser extent. He wasn't totally candid with me there, nor I
                    with him. We talked with some frankness about it. You have to remember that 60
                    days, 90 days after I got there, he was in deep political trouble. Yeltsin
                    pushed him. Every time he tried to have a meeting - Yeltsin standing up and
                    denouncing him before his own people and that sort of thing. That crowded him
                    pretty darn hard. Their relationship became terrible. Before I left Russia, when
                    I went around to say my good-byes to the various people I worked with and the
                    various agencies, I saved him for the last. I even saw President Yeltsin to say
                    good-bye before I saw Gorbachev. I saved him for last. I had tried to tell him
                    the importance the world would place on the two of them establishing some kind
                    of relationship. That he had a responsibility as being the senior statesman of
                    the two to reach out and repair that relationship even more than Yeltsin did
                    because of how well he was known throughout the world, respected throughout the
                    world. But I had no luck, and the last visit I had with him I went in and I told
                    his interpreter, who was a nice man I forget his name, has a mustache.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A bald head, a mustache, he appeared all the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, real nice man. He had interpreted for me for so many hours, both in
                    this country as well as in Russia and the Soviet Union generally, that he and I
                    had a good relationship. I went in to see Gorbachev for that last meeting. He
                    was working for Gorbachev then, not for the Russian government. I said, “Now, I
                    have got an hour that I can spend with the President, maybe a little more. But
                    what I want you to do is see that I get ten minutes without him interrupting me,
                    if you can do that in your role as interpreter. Let me make my speech to him,
                    because I have never been blunt with him as I am going to be today. There is a
                    great deal riding on it.” He said he understood. I said, “Just don't let him
                    interrupt me.” He said he wouldn't and he didn't. After I had been there for
                    about an hour I said to the President, former president, “Mr. President, I have
                    taken a lot of your time in this good-bye and I have listened with great
                    interest to everything you had to say.” He was going through a litany of
                    problems he had, problems he had dealing with Yeltsin, how bad Yeltsin has
                    treated him. With some justification I might add. I said, “Now let me, I want to
                    talk to you and I have arranged with your interpreter that he is going to let me
                    speak for five uninterrupted minutes with you,” because Gorbachev was great for
                    interrupting in the middle of everything. I wound up and started telling him
                    that he and Yeltsin having this kind of fight was a luxury neither one of them
                    could afford and the world couldn't afford, and the Russian people couldn't
                    afford. If he had any sense of responsibility and fully understood how the world
                    looked up to him and his place in the world which gave him that responsibility,
                    that he would go the last mile to cure his problems with Yeltsin. He was so
                    nervous that he had a big leather chair he sat in. I could hear his finger
                    nails. His hands were on each side of that big leather chair, the arms there. He
                    was scratching that leather with his fingernails so loud that I could hear it
                    clearly, and it was driving me crazy while I was talking. He was that intense
                    over it. But when I finished that long speech, about five or six or seven
                    uninterrupted minutes, I ended up by saying, “Now Mr. President, I have had my
                    say, and I couldn't be more sincere. I feel strongly that I am speaking as my
                    government would wish me to speak. I hope you forgive me having said all that, I
                    am ready to have you throw my ass out of your office if that would make you feel
                    better.” I laughed and he laughed and got up and smiled and put his arms around
                    me and kissed me on the cheek and said, “I would never throw your ass out of my
                    office, and I appreciate what you said. But just so you will understand this, I
                    can't tell you everything, but you just don't understand what the situation is.
                    You can't because you have to be in my position to understand that.” I said, “I
                    am sorry, but I hope you will think about it.” He said, “I will.” That ended it,
                    and then I left.</p>

                        from your colleagues and from your own observation at your embassy and from
                        others, watching the bureaucracy which was so important a nomenklatura,
                        beginning to move towards? Was this an apparent, I assume this was a
                        struggle within the apparatus?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes. Well, at the bureaucratic level you didn't see that, at the lower
                    bureaucratic level at all. At the top of course, you did see that. There were a
                    few people that were strong cronies of Gorbachev who you just didn't see
                    anymore. In their place you saw Yeltsin's people. On the other hand, the young
                    man who was sort of a chief of protocol for Gorbachev stayed right on with
                    Yeltsin. I was surprised when I went over there the first time after Yeltsin
                    took over to find him doing the same thing that he had done for Gorbachev.
                    Interestingly he became a friend of mine. I helped him get a job when the
                    previous head of the UN, the Egyptian, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Boutros-Ghali came
                    to Russia just before I left. I said, “There is a young man over here who works
                    at the Russian headquarters. I know you have got a few Russian spots at the UN.
                    If you can get him a job. He has got a young wife and a young daughter. He
                    deserves better than the kind of a job he has here. He will serve you well at
                    the UN.” Butros put his name down and said, “I'll take care of it.” I thought he
                    never would. I swear I got back here, 30 days after he left from being there I
                    heard from my young friend that he had been offered a job at the UN. He is still
                    there. I heard from him this past week that now he is going to get transferred
                    to Geneva. He is still with the UN, so things have a way of working out now and
                    then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know over the years, fifty or more years, we developed
                        this corps of Kremlinologists who would look at who was standing on top of
                        the Lenin Mausoleum etc., and figure out who was on top. Did this serve you?
                        In a way I was wondering with all this concern when a real change was
                        coming, did you find that this group, this expertise served you, or were you
                        pretty well relying on things on the ground?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I relied on things on the ground more than I guess most ambassadors
                    would. In the first place I had confidence in my own instincts on what was going
                    on and the people I was dealing with - the ones that told me the truth and the
                    ones that didn't. The French and the German and the U.S. and the British
                    ambassadors met every Wednesday for an hour to try to put together all the
                    intelligence we had to see if we could make sense of what was going on. We
                    frequently had that discussion of what you were just talking about, who is up
                    and who is down. I may have told this story earlier, but it is a great story
                    because the rumor was always out that Yeltsin was going to change his foreign
                    minister, whose name I don't remember at the moment, but I will get for you.
                    Each of those three were convinced that the foreign minister was going to be
                    gone by the next time we met. That went on for months and months. I would always
                    say you are as wrong as you can be. They would always say why? My answer would
                    always consistently be, “You fellows have to learn to read body language. When
                    you see Yeltsin with his foreign minister, the body language is perfect, even
                    when they disagree. I would rather bet on that than all this great information
                    we are getting.” Sure enough, at the time I left he was still there, and he
                    stayed on as long as Yeltsin was there I might add. The last meeting I had with
                    that group, they poured a little glass of wine to toast my departure. For the
                    toast they said, “To the man who taught us about body language, something we
                    never heard of before,” and they laughed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is a great story. How did you find as somebody who
                        has been nursed at the mother's milk of politics for your entire life
                        practically, did you find yourself comfortable in the rapidly changing
                        political situation in Soviet Russia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh I was intrigued with it, perfectly comfortable with it. As a matter
                    of fact it is strange, but as uncomfortable as I was with myself when I arrived
                    in no time I settled in because of the competence of the foreign service
                    officers we had over there, and the judgment and expertise of my deputy, Jim
                    Collins. I just felt like I was getting the best advice around a guy could get.
                    In no time I became comfortable. When making a decision of any consequence I
                    discussed it with the appropriate foreign service officer and also with Jim
                    Collins. Collins was the very best, so I really had the security blanket around
                    me. I liked my job, and I was comfortable with it. I was glad when it was over.
                    I promised the President I would stay through the election. I did that, and I
                    left without any discomfort. As a matter of fact, Helen wanted to stay a few
                    more months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one of the things sort of professionally that
                        disturbed me was that when the Soviet Union broke apart into its component
                        parts, you know, the “Stans” and all that came into being. Secretary of
                        State Baker did not go to Congress and ask for more money. It meant that we
                        were trying to do this on the cheap which really impacted rather heavily on
                        our people who served in some of these small posts. Did you get involved in
                        this at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I was involved in it quite often. Included in the situations I was
                    comfortable with, I was perfectly comfortable being a Democrat in a Republican
                    administration, and had very few differences with Baker and Bush, really no
                    difference of any consequence. I was working for them. But one thing I couldn't
                    get them to do was go to the Congress and try for more money when they should
                    have. But they were both timid about it. I am not sure Baker was, but I am sure
                    George Bush senior was. I know he was very cautious about going to the Congress
                    and getting money for food relief, for the embassy staffs and office staffing
                    and operations. We were really on an exceedingly thin budget over there. As I
                    recall, even the car I was driving broke down often. It was eight or ten years
                    old and with those Russian roads, that is old. We had trouble getting money to
                    repair the embassy residence when it needed it. We particularly, as I have said
                    earlier, had difficulty with our food relief programs. I mentioned earlier in
                    this, we used canned foodstuffs that came out of the Gulf War to feed people
                    with, that sort of thing. With respect to the embassies, we had to move very
                    fast. They made the decision in Washington that they wanted to staff every one
                    of those new republics with an embassy officer, an ambassador. That took a lot
                    of people. They didn't have any real estate. There were no places you could rent
                    over there if we had the money. So most of those men and women who went over
                    there would go into these communities they were transferred to and live in a
                    third rate hotel room with no kitchen or anything. So they were pretty miserable
                    basically. I thought we could do better, but we didn't have time and we didn't
                    have money.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh, no question about it. But when the administration decided they
                    weren't going to spend the money on that right now, they weren't going to
                    Congress for it, that pretty well made the decision. My job was to do what the
                    President wanted and the Secretary of State. Jim Baker, who by the way was a
                    simply splendid Secretary of State in my judgment, he probably knew, it didn't
                    do him any good in fact with the president. They probably had other places to
                    spend that money. They just handled their Congressional business that way.</p>

                <p>STRAUSS: No, really not a bit. My beat was really Moscow and environs. I would
                    get out to these other places, but not very often, not as much as I wanted to or
                    should have. There just was too much going on where I was.</p>

                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, I went to St. Petersburg any number of times. We had a very strong
                    embassy officer over there who was very able and very well regarded by the St.
                    Petersburg power structure. He had a nice residence he lived in. He entertained
                    a lot. He was a first rate fellow over there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: No, I don't recall. We can get that. He was not a political appointee
                    like I was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, but was there a political power structure in St.
                        Petersburg that was different than the one in Moscow? You know, we talk
                        about the New York group and Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes there was a great deal of difference between them. Keep in mind that
                    the mayor of St. Petersburg had been one of the few people to stand up during
                    that three or four days that Gorbachev was in captivity during the coup. He is
                    the one who stood up for Gorbachev and against the coup. He was a former
                    professor and a very able distinguished man. The mayor of Moscow when I arrived
                    there was a semi academic who was very popular, but with the changes, even
                    before the change came, he had been replaced by a fellow Bushov who is now the
                    Mayor of Moscow. He turned it into a very strong political power center in the
                    Republic of Russia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the disarmament process, getting rid of the
                        nuclear weapons?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I'd say the State Department with the assistance of the Defense
                    Department in my judgment did a simply splendid job. Secretary of State Baker
                    did a simply splendid job because he dealt with the various leaders of the
                    republics in getting their hands on nuclear weapons and getting them moved out
                    of Kazakhstan and other places they were put in under Russian control. I think
                    it was very effective. I give those people who, it seemed to be once a month we
                    had a State Department officer who had responsibility in that area come in and
                    spend a week traveling around the various places that were repositories of
                    nuclear arms, work going on. They were good, and they worked hard, and they
                    worked around the clock. They accomplished a great deal, and that is the reason
                    we have done as well as we have done in my judgment. They set the pattern.</p>

                        always had this potential of being a very productive, wealthy, progressive
                        area, and has had lousy leadership and all. Was this apparent during your

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: It was as apparent as a big wart on your nose could be. No one could
                    deal with it effectively. As a matter of fact I think it is all those things you
                    describe. Interestingly, about two or three years after I came back, a fellow I
                    knew in New York told me that he was investing with a couple of Ukrainians who
                    were raising a fund to acquire interest in Ukrainian businesses. They thought it
                    would be very successful. I said, “Well, I have my doubts, but you are a very
                    sophisticated investor. I will put some money, not as much as you want me to,
                    but I will make a modest investment.” I did, because I thought it would work out
                    well. I think that has been ten years, nine years, and I bet the investment is
                    not worth what it was nine years ago. I always thought, I did think they were
                    right. The reason I just put a small amount in was because the leadership at the
                    top of that government, I thought it was corrupt; it would stay that way. It
                    would hold back, and it has held them back.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find as ambassador to Russia now that the fact
                        that you had these other countries that had broken off, the other republics
                        and former republics around you, did that weaken or distract our
                        relationship with Russia, or was Russia still the 300 pound gorilla at that
                        table.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: That is an understatement. It was more than that, Russia was. The
                    Kazakhs came in. Kazakhstan became more important because they had a head of
                    government at that time by the fact he was going to be the prominent reformer of
                    his era. It turned out not so. We have problems with him right now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let me ask a question on the cultural side. Culture
                        plays quite a strong role in Russia as it does say in France, more than in
                        many other countries. How did you find sort of on the cultural side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I would say that on most of these sides, or some of these sides, because
                    of the people I had around me, I would give myself a grade in many areas of B+
                    to A. On the cultural side, I would give myself a failing grade. They were
                    accustomed to the U.S. ambassador who had more interest in cultural affairs than
                    I did. The cultural side has not been a driving interest of mine in this
                    country, and it was not over there. I think I neglected that now. We tried to
                    support the various things, theater, the Bolshoi, things like that, but I didn't
                    do a very good job. I would go sit in my box and be seen where I needed to be
                    seen.</p>

                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: That is exactly right. I must confess I think when my grandchildren were
                    there, I took them to the circus instead of to the opera. I probably should be
                    ashamed of myself, but I really give myself failing grades.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the intellectual class, the writers and all
                        that? Again as in France, they play a major role.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, and we worked hard on that. I worked hard on that, and I made some
                    marvelous friends over there in that area and enjoyed it. I didn't have the
                    luxury of leisurely developing relationships and getting into other interests.
                    Keep in mind when you get to work rather early at the office, around 8:00 and
                    you are there until 7:00, and you go home and have a drink and supper. You do
                    that six out of seven days a week, you don't have much time. So I tend to do the
                    things I have to do and am really interested in doing and let the others go. It
                    served me well at times of my life, and other times it served me poorly. I wish
                    I could remember the names of some of the people that I developed very nice
                    relationships over there in the intellectual community. I did a great deal of
                    work getting the American school over there. I spent a lot of time locating land
                    and forcing the Russians to let us buy it and get the school open and getting
                    people there. So I had that sort of thing and I did well in that. School is very
                    important to the American colony as you can imagine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it open to other embassies?</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about to Russians, could they go too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I don't recall. I think a few of them could get in each class. We had a
                    pretty good mixture, but it was primarily the American school for Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might point out that some of our other ambassadors who
                        have been there, such as Arthur Hartman, express a great interest in the
                        arts and all, but in a way they had time. You were dealing in a fast moving
                        political situation as opposed to the rest of the time where we have a
                        relatively static relationship.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: The reason a number of people, for example Ambassador Watson, left and
                    Hartman was frustrated was there wasn't enough for them to do constructively
                    because of the relationship. I was blessed in terms of having challenges that I
                    could do more about. They couldn't do disarmament. I had the heavy
                    responsibility in that area, just an obvious difference. I was there when the
                    new republics were born, and I could deal openly with leaders and people like
                    that. They couldn't. The didn't have that freedom. So I had the best of that
                    world, and I was sensible enough to know it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any problem, did you see the Soviet army, I mean
                        the Soviet/Russian army, as a problem being a different power center? I mean
                        they were dissolving the Warsaw Pact, getting troops out of Poland and East
                        Germany and all this. I mean was this a matter of concern to us that they
                        might not be responsive to the political masters as we would like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes. That was a concern. One of the real concerns I had, on several
                    occasions I went out to visit military installations, particularly where I
                    remember vividly going out to spend three or four hours at their air force
                    academy where they train their crack pilots. When you saw the living conditions
                    those pilots were living in, you wonder when it is they are going to break away
                    and say, you know, turn on the government. The same thing was true of all
                    branches of the military. Maybe in the early communist days, the military got
                    the best of everything, but while I was there, they were on starvation wages,
                    not getting paid, and living conditions you wouldn't live, you wouldn't let your
                    puppy live in those conditions. Horrible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess this is probably a good time to stop. We have in a
                        way covered at least for the time, your time in Russia. Now if there is
                        anything else, we will come back and revisit this at that point. Next time
                        maybe we can pick it up what you did when you came back, how you saw Russia
                        and our future with Russia, what you were telling President Bush and
                        Secretary Baker, and again Congress and your contacts, because this is a
                        continuing relationship. I am sure that when you came back you were active
                        in telling what you saw and observed and using your prestige to do this. We
                        will talk about this, and then we will talk about what you are doing
                        thereafter, because we will continue sort of the political side of
                        things.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is April Fools Day, April first, 2003. So we will
                        see what surprises are in this for us. I would like you to talk a bit when
                        you came back to the States. Normally one of the deplorable things about the
                        Department of State is an Ambassador will return sort of in the regular
                        service, and they will say thank you very much. here is your flag and the
                        door is there. They really don't do much in the way of debriefing. But I
                        would think that given both your stature and the situation you were dealing
                        with, you must have been drawn on a lot for your experiences there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well I'd say that statement is partially true, Charles. When I came
                    back, Larry Eagleburger, you recall, had become Secretary of State before I came
                    back. Larry and I were good friends. As a matter of fact, I just spoke with him
                    five minutes ago today. But I couldn't have been received more warmly, Helen and
                    I were. As a matter of fact, Larry had a little reception and gave Helen a
                    little plaque making her hero of the year for having lived with me all those
                    years and also going to Russia with me and putting up with me there. Also I had
                    spent a lot of time that the typical ambassador does not get to spend in one on
                    one conversations with the Secretary of State when it was Jim Baker, and with
                    the same intensity when Eagleburger became Secretary of State. Not because I
                    knew so much, but because I had a personal relationship with each one. I gave
                    them my view on a number of things, some of which I think were useful and some
                    may have been better on a day like today which is April Fools' Day maybe. The
                    people who ran that section, I spent a few hours with the people who ran that
                    section, the Soviet desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Soviet desk, part of the European bureau.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: That was about it. I also was blessed with getting a great many requests
                    to speak. I was out of the government then. Instead of speaking for money, I
                    would speak without fee, and do the speeches I wanted. So I talked to quite a
                    number, a mixed bag of groups of people and enjoyed it as I always do, and got
                    to give my point of view on where we were in Russia and how long it was going to
                    be, the basic strength I saw in Russia, the unique educational system they had,
                    and it was going to stand in good stead. I thought it would take more than a
                    generation. I don't know how they would ever wring out of the system the sins of
                    the system, the corruption. All and all that is sort of the way I would down and
                    got back into the law firm. I was blessed when I came back to the law firm. Of
                    course, I had been out before when I was chairman of the Democratic party, I was
                    out, so the firm was used to having me go out and come back. But I was wise
                    enough to change when I came back in 1980, I said to my partners no more
                    management role for me. I have had that. That is not the highest and best use of
                    my time. In the first place I am not a very efficient manager. I was somehow an
                    effective manager in many ways, but not an efficient one or organized one. My
                    strengths were in other directions, so it was easy for me to fit back into the
                    law firm because the administrative management structure was there, and all I
                    did was take a seat on the management committee. That was about it, and went
                    back doing the same things I had always done which was fiddle around a little in
                    politics, although I was trying to stay out of it. I really entered into when I
                    came back from Russia in the fall of '92 toward the end of the year, I really
                    entered into the private life fully and public life very little. For example, I
                    told my friends in the press when I left to go to Russia, that John White who is
                    a fellow here in town, a good Democrat and a wise and nice man of excellent
                    judgment who is since deceased. I told my friends in the press would call, I
                    said, “Don't call me anymore. You have been calling John White as I suggested
                    for the two years I have been gone. Just keep calling others, because I want to
                    stay out of this. I want to keep my name out of the paper,” which I did pretty
                    well. As a matter of fact it has only been in the last year that I have gone
                    back and taken quite a number of press calls, although I have tried to stay out
                    of commenting on this pre-war effort and the present war effort. If I couldn't
                    see anything good, I kept my mouth shut. Frankly it was harder to speak and say
                    good things when you disagreed with what was going on. It was easier just not to
                    talk. When I did I tried to be supportive of the president as I have always been
                    supportive of our presidents. So that is about my story.</p>

                        looking back with your experience, You know you had a growing democratic
                        electoral process and all. You thought the educational system had real
                        strengths. There was also this corruption and so much became known as the
                        Russian Mafia, buying up the communist controlled properties or taking over.

                    the front people who were acquiring assets for them in countries were another
                    thing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: One of them dealt, I used to think if you go back three generations in
                    the early days of this country, and you see how any of these big rich families
                    who have endowed things...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Vanderbilts, the Morgans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, they were called the robber barons. Well they weren't the robber
                    barons, they were I am guessing they bought Morgans because they were the only
                    ones who had enough sense to know that they were there. They didn't do anything
                    illegal to my knowledge, and I am not so sure these people who acquired these
                    Russian assets did. Russia was practically giving away or selling very cheaply
                    these tremendous assets, and they needed to get them, needed to get them in
                    private hands. felt the same way, so part of it could have been motivation by
                    that had been their motivation, to get it out of the hands of government and to
                    get private money involved, private people involved who had some entrepreneurial
                    skills. Was it a robber baron? Of course it was, but using a general term, not
                    in a literal sense, but of course it was a giveaway of great assets that
                    belonged to the country into these private hands. Some of them were terrible
                    people and some of them were very good people I am sure. It sort of made me sick
                    when it was taking place. I guess the answer is the same thing took place in
                    other countries, although the Russians are uniquely gifted at that kind of
                    conduct. They have seen it for so many years, particularly in the last 75 years.
                    Despite all that I had considerable confidence that the Russians were going to
                    make it. I had more I think than was justified having because I kind of admired
                    some of them. Many ambassadors to countries, you sort of fall in love with the
                    country you have gone to, with the people, and I certainly was guilty of that. I
                    lost some of my objectivity. Unquestionably I liked the Russian people, and I
                    related to them and they to me. Interestingly the fact that I was Jewish never
                    seemed to have any negative impact at all over there. I worried that it might
                    because of their record, but it didn't to my knowledge. I am sure it did in ways
                    I didn't know at the time and still don't know, but my great blessing over there
                    was that I was able to do what George Bush initially asked me to do, President
                    George Bush the first, and that was establish relationships where he could have
                    a personal relationship through me daily with the heads of government, and their
                    senior people. As I said to you before, that was my strength and I played it and
                    I did well at that. I didn't do nearly as well in other areas I am sure. The
                    ambassador that preceded me came back from his tour and wrote a splendid book.
                    He made, he went back on campus; he went back in teaching. I forget where but a
                    distinguished university, and he is a distinguished scholar. He had other
                    shortcomings. There was nothing distinguished about my scholarship or my
                    knowledge about Russia. I didn't really have any unique understanding of what
                    was taking place or going to take place. Most of what I knew came because I knew
                    how to talk to the people over there who did know and get a feel for it. I
                    forget his name, who was our ambassador?</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Matlock, Jack Matlock was a brilliant Russian scholar and had his
                    shortcomings as an ambassador, very obvious ones, and great strengths I might
                    add. I think the same thing is true of me. I had great strengths and many more
                    obvious shortcomings than Jack Matlock did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, basically sort of in your bones you are a
                        politician. This was a political process which must have been fascinating to
                        watch because in many ways the United States and Russia have been compared
                        to the opening of the frontiers and all, the same sense of humor and things
                        of this nature. How did you view the developing political process and
                        particularly say and earlier on. Was Yeltsin a politician?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: It was fascinating. He was a great politician. He was a better
                    politician than Gorbachev was in a narrow political sense. At least he was in
                    the days when I first met him. Of course he deteriorated after that. Alcohol
                    took a hell of a toll on him as you know. It wasn't just, that was not just
                    rumor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape eight, side one with Robert Strauss. Did you
                        see a political process that was parallel? Is there sort of a basic
                        political process that develops in any country in your experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: I saw it develop there. I remember the first day I met their first chief
                    justice of their court about his third day in office. I thought to myself what a
                    nice man this is, knows absolutely nothing about what he is going to do. I spent
                    an hour or two with him, but with this kind of a fellow they have a chance. The
                    truth of the matter is he turned out to be not so good. He was a rather weak
                    appointment for the first fellow. The most moving thing, one of the most moving
                    things I saw over there, I was present the first day the Duma met. I remember
                    going over and sitting in that gallery. I wanted to see that and get the kind of
                    feel you are talking about, and see the real beginning of grassroots democracy,
                    people coming from all over that vast country to participate in that opening
                    ceremony of the Duma. I think I may have told this story before, but we had a
                    real bright young woman, who by the way I think is still with the State
                    Department. She has been all over the world and has three or four children. I
                    said, to her, I am trying to think of her first name now. I said, “I want you to
                    go over there and hang around. Whatever you do every day, spend some time with
                    that chairman of the judiciary committee or foreign relations committee.” He may
                    have become ambassador to this country for awhile. “Find out what is going on
                    every day in this formative stage so we will know and we can report.” Of course
                    she did it brilliantly. I saw him after about three months of that process at
                    some reception. I went over to him, shook hands and greeted each other warmly. I
                    said, “Tell me what is going on.” He said, “You are asking me what is going on?”
                    He said, “With that beautiful girl you have talking to me, you know everything
                    you know, you know everything she knows, and she knows everything I know, so why
                    ask me? Tell me what is going on.” He laughed, and I laughed. That was the
                    beginning of the process at that level, and it was fascinating moving
                    through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see, did anybody call on you hey Ambassador
                        Strauss, we want to start a political party. Nobody knows more about parties
                        than you do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I never had that. I used to wonder about that. I never had that. Of
                    course they had parties then, you understand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, Yaboka.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: That was the liberal party. They had the party system. It wasn't
                    perfect, but I might add ours isn't either. So that was those thing, all that
                    was going on. It is incredible when you think about it, the transformation that
                    took place as I was leaving. The last couple of months and the first couple of
                    months after was simply fascinating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a problem with the State Department, I am
                        talking about the higher people dealing with Russia as Yeltsin was taking
                        over? I mean were there a lot of feeling that just wasn't up to it, because
                        of his drunkenness and other things and thought oh my god they are going to
                        end up with another coup or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, there were great reservations about, but he also had the ability
                    when he got his hands on them, he captured them. For example, I saw Jim Baker
                    who in my judgment was a simply splendid secretary of state. History has proven
                    already, the short history we have had since he left how right he was. Baker
                    came from an administration that had grave doubts about Yeltsin before he came
                    there. Keep in mind, before he came, before the breakup, he came to this
                    country, the White House, the President wouldn't receive him, President Bush. He
                    was afraid it would offend Gorbachev and also he had his detractors. So that
                    Yelstin had to earn his way, and he did. He did it with George Bush when we
                    brought him to Camp David, and he spent a day up there with Bush. It wasn't a
                    state visit, it was just a visit over here to see Bush to go to Camp David. I
                    think President Bush would surely have preferred not to have to fool with it,
                    but I was pushing to bring him over here. We got him over here. They related
                    extremely well with each other. Jim Baker came to like him very much, as did I
                    as I have indicated, and by the way, Vice Versa. He had considerable, great
                    confidence, more that considerable, in Jim Baker as an impressive and astute
                    man. Here is this guy who really has this political feel that is excellent and
                    has the right instincts in terms of the democratic institutions we were trying
                    to establish in that country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about looking back on the role of other countries? I
                        particularly think of France, Germany and Great Britain. The French always
                        seem to be in a different angle from us. Did you find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes. As a matter of fact it was interesting. I think it was just
                    personalities more than anything else, but, I am smiling as I am speaking here
                    because just a few days ago we talked about the French. I said that I remember
                    when I was in Russia, the French, they were always the most difficult of the
                    countries. The German and the French and the British, and the U.S. ambassador as
                    I mentioned earlier would meet once a month or once a week and exchange our
                    views on what was going on. The French were always a bit out of step then, and
                    the Brits and ourselves were always very close. I'll tell you something that
                    worries me. This notion that is spreading around here this crazy thing of the
                    French who disappoint us terribly in this Iraqi situation, but we had better
                    learn to get along with them because we are going to have to get along with the
                    French and a lot of other people, and we have got a lot of work to do on that.
                    The French more than most are going to need plenty of attention and concern to
                    try to get those relationships re-established in the interest of the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, did you find the, what about commercial
                        interests? You know, I mean when you look at Russia, China, when these
                        places are opening up, I mean quite rightly so, every manufacturer,
                        exporter, entrepreneur takes one look and says boy that is a big market,
                        let's go for it. How did you find this played with you and say with the
                        British and the French and the Germans?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: We in the American business community took a look at it and said we'll
                    wait. The Germans who were close were doing a lot more business than we were and
                    than were the French or the British. But they all three were doing more than we
                    were doing over there. In the first place, they understood it better and were
                    closer related to Russia, more familiar in an understandable way, an
                    understanding way than our American business community were. We had a hard time
                    capturing the imagination of people, Russian business interests in terms of
                    their making capital investments in the country. I think I may have mentioned
                    earlier that I had a story that I would tell. The Russians were very hesitant
                    about the Americans acquiring Russian assets anyway. When companies would
                    consider coming in there, they would need to buy land or participate at all in
                    making investments, the Russians were very reticent to have that at that time.
                    Later they were desperate to have capital. They didn't realize. They had a
                    feeling that the American investor would take what they had and leave them and
                    go back home with the money. I used to tell them that the American, I think I
                    have mentioned earlier in this tape, the American railroad system, the American
                    educational system our school buildings, all those things, our transportation,
                    all those things are paid for by French and German and British and Dutch and
                    other country's money. It came to America, was invested, and never returned back
                    to those countries. It stays invested and it grows and grows, and it is great
                    capital for the United States, and the same thing will happen in Russia. When
                    American companies come and invest, they won't bring the money home, because the
                    investment will be good, and they will keep their investment here. It will be
                    here for generations, and you will have the benefit of that capital and we will
                    all benefit by the fact that we are doing business together. That was sort of a
                    simple way of telling the story. People would nod, but they didn't respond
                    really.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was somebody in the embassy or somewhere keeping an eye on
                        as you mentioned the judicial system, which in a way is the key. you know, I
                        mean if you don't have a sound judicial system, you can't have
                        investment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: We had been pushing for that since the first day I was there, with
                    marginal success. Compared to even three years ago, progress had been made, but
                    the Judicial system still leaves a great deal to be desired in terms of people
                    having the confidence in it they should, and in terms frankly of the character
                    and integrity of they system still leaves a lot to be desired. But they made
                    tremendous progress starting with nothing which they had. That has kept
                    investment out as much as anything else. You can't have any confidence in a
                    lawsuit. You go to trial over there with someone who defaults on a transaction
                    or just a typical commercial one. A matter we would handle in this country
                    privately or sometimes through the courts. American business felt they would not
                    have the remedy of the courts.</p>

                        British have and some others, the French and the Germans I don't think have
                        gone completely there, but gone to basically a volunteer force because we
                        find that it works better than having mass conscription. Certainly the
                        Soviet system was pretty horrendous. I mean what it would do to the young
                        men who came in. I mean it is quite brutal and really didn't turn out very
                        good soldiers. Were we looking at this and trying to say, look if you are
                        going to get a better military.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well our military attach� spent a lot of time working on this, those
                    sorts of problems. We had a particular interest in establishing our relationship
                    with the military because of the nuclear threat and things we are dealing with.
                    We had good people, and some of their people are very good, and some of them
                    were very bad. And they had no money. That was our biggest problem, they didn't
                    have the money do anything anyway. We had to pay pretty well for what we got
                    done. So that is a continuing problem today. But the Russian military leaves a
                    good deal to be desired as you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you came back, did you find you were

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, of course we were. I might add that we urged caution. We urged
                    caution and still do I might add. But I know I think this war will be over in a
                    reasonable period of time right now. I am talking Iraq.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes. I think it is obviously going to take a lot longer there than we
                    were led to believe by the administration, military or what have you. When it is
                    over and when we start bringing some stability to that country. I think we are
                    going to see in the next few years increased U.S. investment in Russia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, turning away from, Russia may crop up, but let's
                        talk about the political scene. You have been an observer, and I don't
                        imagine you can turn your political observing view off. how did you view the
                        campaign of '92 with Bill Clinton versus George Bush?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, I was in Russia during that campaign, but I used to discuss it
                    every day on the phone with somebody because I was just curious. I, like most
                    people, thought that it was a fool's errand that Bill Clinton was on. It was not
                    until six or eight months before the election that I realized that Bush was in
                    trouble, getting in trouble. I told several of his friends he was. Bill Clinton
                    surprised me by his success. I didn't think he and Gore would make it. I didn't
                    have a feel for it until the last 60 days. It was obvious that Bush senior
                    didn't seem to have his mind on getting re-elected to the extent that he should

                        of model was it is the economy, stupid. Also that Bush kept talking about he
                        was uncomfortable with the concept of vision.STRAUSS: That vision

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, I do. I think that Bush was burned out. I don't know why.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, keep in mind he had been eight years as vice president and four
                    years as president, and he was burned out, and it showed I think. He never
                    really took Clinton seriously. He never dreamed they were going to have the
                    Perot problems they were going to have. Remember Perot was a major factor in
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Remember Perot was a third candidate.</p>

                <p>STRAUSS: If you ask George Bush senior today what defeated him, he would say Ross
                    Perot, and he won't be all wrong. There is a lot of basis for believing that. So
                    all those things came up and all of a sudden, boom, he is defeated. They were
                    stunned.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that the Democratic Party and sort of the
                        contrast with the Republican Party was very hard core constituency, and the
                        Democratic party where the hard core constituency doesn't seem to be there
                        as much?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: No you begin with the extremes. The extreme left, I may have mentioned
                    this earlier in this thing. In my view, the extreme left of the Democratic Party
                    buzzes around you, the leadership, and drives you crazy, stings you here and
                    stings you there. They are tremendous pests and nuisances and they get in the
                    way. Their rhetoric is foolish. That is not a very good word for it, but
                    whatever it is, it is not very impressive. The right wing of the Republican
                    Party is different. The right wing is just as nutty as the Democrat's left wing,
                    or the Democrat's left wing is just as nutty as the Republican right wing. Ten
                    Percent, or fifteen percent of the gauge is always a little off center. But the
                    difference in the Republican Party is, Jim Baker and I used to talk about this a
                    lot. Really this is his language. He would say, “Strauss, one thing you don't
                    understand, the right wing of the Republican Party is different from your left
                    wing. The right wing has money; they have structure, and they know how to crush
                    you. They don't sting you like you talk about the Democrats buzzing around you
                    like insects driving you crazy. In our party, they don't drive you crazy, they
                    crush you and kill you. That is the difference between the two. Our right wing
                    has structure and money. The left wing has neither structure nor money.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the Clinton administration in a way never really got
                        much of a chance to show itself because it had two years in and all of a
                        sudden they were hit with a Republican Congress. What was your reading on
                        sort of this revolution, because again it seems to be a much more, much less
                        cooperative type Congress president thing when they are in different
                        parties.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well I think the whole climate has changed, the political climate has
                    changed for the worse in this country. Politics, don't let people say it was
                    always this way, because politics today is meaner. By today I mean current,
                    modern, is much meaner than it was in the past. They whole system here is
                    changed, Charles. Congressmen come to town and stay here several weeks and
                    Senators, without going home. They are around here on weekends and got socially
                    together. When you went to a dinner party, you would see party people there, and
                    there would be 15-20 Democrats and 15-20 Republicans. So they developed a
                    personal relationship. These people now go off and raise money. They leave here
                    on Thursday afternoon or Friday and go home and raise money most weekends. They
                    are not in town. There is nobody in the Congress to amount to anything around
                    here over the weekend. They don't see each other, and they come back and they go
                    into a combative situation or a contested situation with the other. They never
                    develop personal relationships like they used to have. It has hurt the whole
                    damn system in my judgment. There is very little. People think I am a freak
                    because I have relationships with both sides of the aisle. I have always had
                    relationships with both sides of the aisle, even in Texas which was almost a one
                    party state. We Democrats were cordial to the Republicans, the handful that
                    there were, and they the same. But that has all changed now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, I mean looking at it over the years, what
                        about the money situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well that is what has caused most of this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you say how this developed? I mean what was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Well, what was it is the laws forbade. Financing of campaigns took place
                    in a far more permissive climate, and under far more permissive laws and rules
                    and regulations than is now the case. Now there are some restrictions that don't
                    mean anything because you can always get around them. They are going to mean
                    something now. Hard money and soft money is going to make a big difference. The
                    truth of the matter is, the recent legislations that the Democrats passed,
                    caused to be passed, in my judgment, hurt the Democrats who passed it far more
                    than it did the Republicans. This removal of soft money, the only way the
                    Democrats had been able to compete was through soft money. Now it is not a good
                    system, and I am not saying they shouldn't have gotten rid of it, but the
                    Democrats reformed themselves into even a worse position than they were prior to
                    that. I don't know how it is going to change. I know one thing, people will
                    continue to find a way around the law. It is just like water seeking cracks in
                    concrete. Money will find people, and people will find money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find particularly the House of
                        Representatives, the Newt Gingrich crowd, was this a different crowd than
                        you were used to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh Certainly. Newt was a very bright, very able fellow who his own crowd
                    didn't like, and the other side didn't like. He elected more than anyone, he
                    elected these Republican majorities that we now face on this country for the
                    better or the worse depending on where you stand. But as soon as he got it done,
                    they threw him out. He was the first to go down the tube.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you find as a practitioner of this, I realize you
                        now were some removed, but did you find this a different breed of cat that
                        came in to the House of Representatives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh certainly. Yes, no question about it. You look at the, I don't want
                    to be overly critical of the House and Senate, but the stature of the people who
                    represent the people of this country in both the House and the Senate in my
                    judgment are not of the quality in terms of just stature itself and background
                    and accomplishment and breadth of vision and understanding of those who were in
                    the same place 20 years ago and further back. I don't think there is any
                    question about that. Now you may say that is a prejudice of an old man, you are
                    not objective on it, Strauss, But that is more than prejudice looking at
                    this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: True, I am not impressed when you think about the old
                        titans of Congress.</hi>

                <pb facs="0173" n="Page0173"/>
                <p>STRAUSS: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Clinton's agenda and his performance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Bill Clinton is one of the most attractive political people and
                    certainly one of the brightest I have ever known. He suffered from a lack of
                    personal discipline, and that lack of discipline is a luxury that you can't
                    afford to have. The country is worse off because of it, and he is certainly
                    worse off because of it. He continues, I think, to make mistakes of judgment
                    that he shouldn't make. Now, he had a good eight years, and they accomplished
                    some things. He left a lot on the table because he was so tied up in his
                    personal involvements. I must say that he was tormented more than any president
                    I have ever seen. He was so visible, he was everywhere, and his lack of
                    discipline added to that made him a very good target for his detractors. He
                    literally drove them crazy, and they literally spent zillions of dollars trying
                    to destroy Bill Clinton. The hatred that is there is amazing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am ten years younger than you, but I remember it as a
                        kid growing up sort of as a rabid, my mother was a rabid Roosevelt mother in
                        places like San Marino and New England prep school and we were surrounded by
                        rabid Roosevelt haters. I never observed that same degree of hatred, I mean
                        real visceral hatred until Bill Clinton came along.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: The hatred, there were many individuals who exhibited that hatred of
                    Bill Clinton. But I never saw this actual bloc of anti anything compared with
                    anti Clinton people. He was so good, and you could just see that people, all he
                    had to do was open his mouth, you could see the hair rise up on their necks. It
                    was not a healthy situation at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well one of the things that bothered me going back to
                        compare the Clinton time and the Roosevelt time was with Hillary Clinton who
                        obviously was an extremely accomplished woman. Talking about Hillary
                        Clinton. I noticed this really visceral hate of President Clinton was almost
                        intensified about Hillary Clinton. I immediately go back to Eleanor
                        Roosevelt. What was your personal feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Hillary Clinton is, I don't need to tell you, is attractive physically
                    and intellectually. The worst thing that happened to Hillary Clinton in terms of
                    people hating her is that when she announced for the Senate, they couldn't wait
                    to get their hands on her and destroy here, and lo and behold, she got elected.
                    Then she gets over in the Senate and who does she take over but half of the
                    right wingers over there. Jessie Helms was her biggest fan. She didn't waste any
                    time, and she handled herself when she entered the Senate, I think, perfectly.
                    She kept her mouth shut. She did her work, and she made personal relationships
                    with the power senators of the Senate. It just drives, people who dislike her,
                    it drives them off the wall when they hear that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Oh I guess there is, I guess there has always been that, but I really
                    think, frankly, I think there is an awful lot of money spent by these hate
                    organizations, still being spent on hating the Clintons, not as much as when
                    they were in office, but these hate mongers are out there. You listen to talk
                    radio, these right wingers, you bring up the name Clinton, it is
                    frightening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This talk radio, we don't really have it around here so
                        much. We have quite good talk radio, very informed people. Sort of out in
                        the hinterlands it seems to be designed for angry middle aged or older
                        men.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: Yes, I think that is probably right. It is a shame, but that is not
                    their fault. They have got a right to do that. The fault lies in the people who
                    disagree with that who don't spend the money and the time and the effort dealing
                    with it. If you have got a better idea, we have always believed in this country,
                    you can sell it. Well if we have got a better idea, we have done a lousy job in
                    selling it in my judgment. I feel very strongly abut that, that these people are
                    all over the place. There is a lot of important money supporting them. I know
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that your identification with the Democrats

                </p>
                <p>STRAUSS: I think being a Democrat is a negative in terms of being able to sell
                    yourself to the business community. I guess 75% of the business community or 85%
                    belong to the Republican party. An awful lot of them are true believers and
                    believe there is a difference between Republicans and Democrats. When I speak, I
                    always love to say what I believe, and that is I know you people won't like to
                    hear this or believe it, but the simple truth of the matter is there is about
                    the same percentage of horses' asses in the Republican party as there is in the
                    Democratic Party and vice versa. You will never convince me to the contrary. Now
                    people don't like to hear that. They like to hear the other side is evil.</p>

                <p>STRAUSS: No, there was a big generational skip there. I knew him. His father
                    brought him to see me. I think I told the story. It was when he was thinking
                    about running for Congress. He was a nice man, but he had never done anything.
                    That is not his fault that he got elected president. That is the Democrats fault
                    in Texas and it is the Democrats fault in the United States that they didn't
                    elect their candidate. I don't know whether Gore was a better candidate or a
                    worse candidate or a better president or a worse president than George Bush. I
                    know one thing. He was a worse candidate at the time he ran against him.</p>

                <p>STRAUSS: Well, I think damn near everything he did. That is an overstatement; I
                    didn't mean that to that extreme. In the first place he is not very appealing.
                    He is not comfortable with people. I was one of a group of about 20 democrats
                    who were asked to meet with him throughout this campaign. It got more intense
                    when Bill Daley took it over. His father was a friend of mine, and Bill Daley is
                    a younger man than I am and to some extent a bit of a prot�g�, although he is
                    not a prot�g� of Bob Strauss but only of that generation. But you couldn't even
                    get Gore to stay and meet with these people. We would go out to Gore's vice
                    presidential residence for political meetings in the middle of the campaign, and
                    if Gore was there he would be upstairs. He wouldn't even come down and say
                    hello. I think they made it, they called one meeting I remember. It was set for
                    10:00 and they changed it to 10:30. I asked them why they made it later because
                    it changed a bunch of people's appointments around. They said, “Well, the Vice
                    President wasn't going to be able to get out here until just about 10:30, and he
                    didn't want to have to spend time with the people who were meeting there on his
                    business. Now that is, you had 20 people who were so angry about that in that
                    room who were supposed to be supporting him. He was not a very good candidate.
                    He didn't go where he should have gone, and he knows those things. They are why
                    he is not running now.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to finish up this portion, could you talk just a
                        little about your impression, we are right in the middle of this situation
                        but what led up to it sounds like we are mired in or at a pause in the war
                        with Iraq, 12 days into it. But particularly as a former ambassador,
                        diplomacy and all of this administration. In the first place when it came on
                        board and what led them to this. What is your impression?</hi>

                <p>STRAUSS: Well I don't like to be critical of an administration in time of war.
                    That is for damn sure, and I am not going to be. Even though this is private, it
                    still will be public. But I think their diplomacy leaves a great deal to be
                    desired. I don't think it is necessarily the fault of the Secretary of State. I
                    think he has lost an awful lot of battles in the administration. I think that
                    the hard liners have won time after time. They are all people I have known
                    forever, and it saddens me. But that is not my opinion, that is the opinion of
                    an awful lot of people, strong Republicans who find themselves unable to
                    contribute anything. This White House has really shut out the leadership of the
                    Republican party and to a great extent, the leadership that has experience.
                    Whether you are talking about George Schultz or Jim Baker or Larry Eagleburger
                    or Brent Scowcroft. These are very wise, experienced people who should be
                    involved there and could help this President a great deal, but his people don't
                    seem to call on them. The President has to have people around him to see that he
                    is exposed to that sort of thought when he is making major decisions. I think
                    that is one of the failings of this administration. I think Schroeder the
                    Chancellor in Germany was never a very loved man anywhere, and I don't blame
                    President Bush and his people for being very unhappy with him, that he ran for
                    re-election against this country, but when the election was over, Bush and his
                    people should have called on him and said Chancellor, congratulations. The past
                    is over now and we have got to get together. You got elected and we were a good
                    tool for you, but now we have got to get together. We have got real problems and
                    we have got to solve them together. I think that would have had the Germans back
                    with us which makes a whole different thing in putting a coalition together, and
                    altogether different climate. Those kind of mistakes, that is just childish
                    pique about shaking hands with the Chancellor of Germany and the Secretary of
                    Defense not shaking hands with his counterpart or the Chancellor. That is
                    crazy.</p>
