                <p>AMBASSADOR CLINT A. LAUDERDALE</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: August 16, 1994</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me a bit about your background? We were
                        discussing beforehand that you are into genealogy, so about your parents,
                        where you were born, a bit about that first.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes. I was born September 14, 1932, in West Texas, on a farm. I grew
                    up there. Those were the Depression years. I guess we were a poor family,
                    although we weren't any poorer than our neighbors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that part of the Dustbowl or were you able to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: No. That was further north, in Oklahoma. Of course I was born in the
                    Depression, but by the time I got to be a teenager it was in the War years.
                    Still, I came from a modest, poor farm family in West Texas. We were a large
                    family. After I got out of high school, during the Korean War, which started in
                    1950 and I graduated from high school in 1950, I went off to college for one
                    year. I had a hard time...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What college did you go to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I went to one in east Texas called Tarleton State, a branch of Texas
                    A &amp; M. But I was poor, I had no source of income, I couldn't get a job so I
                    was a little unhappy. My grades were okay, Bs mostly. So after a year in college
                    I figured I was going to get drafted in the end, so why struggle. So I signed up
                    in the Army, went to Fort Ord, California for basic training. Didn't want to go
                    to Korea, by the way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there in 1951 then, in Fort Ord?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were neighbors. I was at the Army language school in
                        Monterey at that time, as an Air Force private.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Well all of the graduating basic training classes were off to Korea.
                    I think everybody west of the Mississippi went to Korea! So I was a little
                    unhappy about that, how am I going to get out of that? Fortunately I made a good
                    score on the Army tests, so they called me for an interview and offered me an
                    assignment in intelligence, which I snapped up immediately. So they sent me east
                    to Baltimore to go to intelligence school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Holabird?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes, it's interesting that you should know that. Then at Fort
                    Holabird I got the word that anybody who volunteers for overseas will get it, so
                    I said okay, I volunteer for Germany. So I did, I got it and served in Germany
                    for two and a half years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you in Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Wuerzburg. Beautiful, nice place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Baroque city. But then it was still pretty much in ruins I
                        guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: It was pretty much in ruins, poverty stricken. When I first arrived
                    in Germany I remember that we used to ride the streetcars free, because we were
                    occupation forces. And during the time I was there they signed the Consensual
                    Agreement which gave Germany its sovereignty, so then we had to start paying 10
                    pfennigs to ride the streetcar. I got married when I was there. In those days
                    you could only get married when you were going home, so I got married a couple
                    of months before going home. Came back, went to California, where I had been
                    before - I had a sister who lived in the Bay Area - and enrolled in Berkeley.
                    When I had gone to school before, I majored in mathematics. I had a good math
                    score on the tests. But after three years away from mathematics I was a little
                    concerned about trying to pick that up again. In the meantime, discovering the
                    overseas world, I heard about Embassy-Bonn, the foreign service, so I said,
                    “That's for me.” So I went to see a professor at Berkeley and asked what I
                    should study to be a foreign service officer, and he said, “Political Science.”
                    So I did, Got my degree, took my exam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about the Foreign Service exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a three-and-a-half day exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: No, it was all day. I took it three times actually. The first time
                    when I was still a junior. I failed it. The second time I took it I passed the
                    written, but when I went for the oral I told the Board - we had three examiners
                    - that my son was a diabetic. I wanted them to know that right up front. Anyway,
                    I didn't pass. So I took it again. The next year they didn't give the exam. So I
                    had to wait two years, took it again, passed it again, went to the oral. At the
                    end of the oral, the examiner told me something I didn't know before. He said
                    the last panel turned you down because your son is a diabetic, but you did such
                    a good job that we're going to recommend you for a waiver. So anyway, I got past
                    that hurdle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in 196....?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: The first one must have been in about '56, because I graduated in
                    '57. Then the second one was in '58, and the third one must have been in 1960.
                    In the meantime, after I got my degree I went to graduate school for a little
                    while and then I went to work. I found a job in the federal government, GS-7,
                    came to Washington, was later transferred up to Boston, and I took the oral that
                    year, I guess it was '61 by then, in Boston, that's the one I passed. In the
                    meantime I had prospered in my civil service career and I got an offer of
                    employment as an FSO-8. I had just gotten promoted to GS-12 and I was just
                    making $10,000 a year, or close to it. FSO-8 would have been about $6,000. I was
                    also by then about 28 or 29. So I said, that's a little junior for me, but I
                    would take an FSO-7. They said No, we can't do that, and so I said, okay, adios.
                    A couple of months later I got a letter that said: “We've made some internal
                    policy changes and we're going to adjust a lot of FSO-8s to FSO-7s, and we can
                    offer appointments to new FSO-7s, and you're one. We'll offer you a 7. I got the
                    maximum step of a 7, which was $7,500. So I only had to take a cut of $2,500. It
                    took me five years to get back to $10,000! That was in 1962.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting how the system does change and does
                        work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Could I tell you an out-of-sequence story?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Later, when I was DAS for Personnel, and Phil Habib, who had been
                    Under Secretary of State and was retired but was working in and out on various
                    projects, and he worked on a recruitment committee for Secretary Vance. He came
                    to see me one day, upset, he was chairman of the Recruitment and Employment
                    Committee, to do a study. He had been a professor or something at Stanford after
                    retirement, and three of his graduate students, in his graduate seminar, took
                    the FSO exam and failed the oral. They passed the written but failed the oral.
                    And he told me: “Clint, there's something wrong with this exam if three of my
                    best students failed it.” And I said, “How many times did they take it?” And he
                    said, “Well, once.” And I said: “Well, I failed it twice! The answer to your
                    students is, take it again.” Since he had passed the first time he thought
                    everybody did, but I told him half the people in the foreign service didn't make
                    it the first time. Try, try again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came in in '62, right? Did you go to the A-100 course?
                        Can you give just a feel for what your group was like and maybe what their
                        outlook was like at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: My class, based on remarks by the course coordinators — we had two at
                    the time — my class was older than the average class had been. I think I was the
                    first class that they took in FSO-7s, that may have been the reason. Because the
                    previous class had been just FSO-8s, and I guess some of the older people turned
                    them down. The average age in my class...it's nothing by today's standards, but
                    one of the students was 33! And I was 29, and the average age in the class was
                    27. I think the fact that they hadn't given the exam one year also had an
                    impact. My class - we were 33 by the way - was an older class, it had a Black
                    woman in it, the first black woman FSO, Joyce Scott I think her name was, but
                    she resigned at the end of the class. And it had some, I suppose, iconoclastic,
                    a little more challenging students, maybe because we were older, but they
                    characterized my class as a different kind of class.</p>
                <p>My two course coordinators, one was okay, the other one...they were not good role
                    models for the Foreign Service, though.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think there was a tendency to, there wasn't much
                        effort to make sure they got the right person there...it was just a
                        job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I think it was just a job, I don't think they tried to pick role
                    models particularly. One of the course instructors I think had an illness. I've
                    heard of an illness of sleeping sickness, but we think he had it. Because he
                    used to regularly fall asleep after lunch, even when we went to Citibank in
                    Philadelphia and here the president and vice-president spends an hour telling us
                    about the international banking business, and our coordinator falls asleep. We
                    were embarassed, the young FSOs, so he was not a good role model. When he was
                    awake he was okay.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>I don't know if this is a good time to tell, but my class's future outlook...the
                    survival rate wasn't very high. Within ten years more than half the class was
                    out of the Foreign Service for one reason or another.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm particularly interested in your mentioning Joyce
                        Scott, who was the first Black woman FSO, and who left after the class. Do
                        you have any idea why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes I do. She had what was then a little unusual but now a very
                    common circumstance, a live-in boyfriend. She had a fiance, I guess. He lived in
                    Detroit, from where she came. When it came time to go overseas she reflected and
                    decided she'd go back to Detroit and live with him rather than go off to
                    Australia or someplace. I think that was it.</p>
                <p>Another class member who was a good friend of mine was a woman who is in the
                    Foreign Service today, Mary Tracy; however, resigned, she was assigned to
                    Australia or someplace far away. She also had a boyfriend, got a proposal to
                    marry, resigned to get married, and then didn't get married. Something happened.
                    So for 15 years or so she was out in the cold, and when I was later DAS for
                    Personnel we were recruiting minorities and women, I called her up. I said “How
                    would you like to come back in the Foreign Service. And she said: “I'd love it.”
                    So we reappointed her and she's in the Foreign Service today. Didn't prosper
                    very well because of the hiatus. The mid-career program didn't work very well.
                    Some of my other classmates....various things happened. I think we lost three
                    right away through resignations I told you about and through various things. One
                    member later committed suicide, others, one spoke Russian, went to Moscow on his
                    first tour and on his second tour he was assigned to Africa somewhere and he
                    resigned. Just didn't have the discipline I guess. Thought he should go to Bonn
                    instead.</p>
                <p>I guess my class produced two Ambassadors. I was the first one, and then a couple
                    of years later one other member. Most of the other members of my class never
                    reached the senior ranks except the two of us. But I guess that's difficult too,
                    everybody can't...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What you're saying does point out one of the real problems
                        in recruiting for the Foreign Service at the time. If women had to resign if
                        they married, it meant that recruiters and Board of Examiners and all
                        couldn't help but think...you know, the attrition rate is so heavy,
                        particularly in those days people did get married more than they do now. It
                        was one of the real factors. It was a bad policy but at least we knew what
                        it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Well, now where did you want to go when you...</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: In Berkeley I used to hang around International House quite a bit.
                    One of my students friends married an Arab, I think from Baghdad. Another of my
                    student friends was from Tehran. So I became interested in that part of the
                    world. In fact I studied a little Arabic in the evening. I learned how to write
                    the basic alphabet and such things. So when I was in the A-100 course we got to
                    spend a few days “on the desk.” So I picked what was called in those days
                    “Greece/Turkey/Iran.” And I was interested in going to Tehran or Baghdad.
                    Instead I was assigned to Santo Domingo. And I wasn't too happy about that, but
                    I got used to it. I went and enrolled in Spanish. Then before it came time to
                    go, but after I had bought my island clothes and so forth, the Department said:
                    “You're not going to Santo Domingo, we're going to send you to Mexico City
                    instead.” And I said, “I want to go to Santo Domingo!” And they said it was the
                    first case we ever heard of somebody...! But I had bought a white suit. They say
                    you need it down there. And I had bought a white dinner jacket for my otherwise
                    black tux, because the post report said that young officers need it. I
                    eventually wore that white dinner jacket 30 years later when I was Ambassador to
                    Guyana I wore it for the first time!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that a Schwartz special?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes it was! And I carried it in that plastic bag all those years. And
                    it still fit!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: S.S. Schwartz being the wholesale tailor in Baltimore whom
                        all Foreign Service officers went to because they carried tropical clothes
                        all year round, so you could always stock up there. And they were also used
                        to the trade.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes, I bought my tux there, which I still have. It still fits. And my
                    white dinner jacket and so forth. So my first post was Mexico City.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got to Mexico City, what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I was...they had started a rotational system and I was supposed to
                    rotate. We all started in the Consular Section. In the doing I spent one year in
                    the Consular Section and one year on the Administrative Section. I never rotated
                    to Political and Econ. I was a visa officer. It was a real visa mill. We had
                    four or five non-immigrant visa officers, all day every day in a little cubicle.
                    I processed an average of 300 a day. You couldn't go for a cup of coffee, you
                    couldn't go to the Men's room without knowing that there were 10-20 people
                    standing in front of your window while you were gone. I used to even feel guilty
                    about going to get a cup of coffee or to the Men's room or whatever. Just a real
                    treadmill.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did this do?? Did this get to you? I mean this wasn't
                        the fancy diplomatic life you expected. How did you feel about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: It wasn't so much that it wasn't the fancy diplomatic life. That puts
                    it in a negative, and I think the wrong, context. It was dealing with
                    foreigners, interviewing. So I didn't object to that. What I objected to was,
                    because I had worked before in other jobs, these were awful working conditions.
                    It wasn't that the nature of the work was so onerous; it was the volume and the
                    conditions under which you worked that was objectionable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you refusing a lot of visas at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yeah. The other aspect of it was, to some degree, the arbitrariness
                    of it. It was a lot more what I considered arbitrary, because in so many cases
                    it was a judgment — is this person likely to return? And often, under the
                    circumstances I told you, where you do 300 a day, you can give each person one
                    or two minutes, you don't have much data. If you could sit down and talk to each
                    one for five minutes you'd have a much better sense. But we couldn't do
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you work it? I'm curious about the process. You're
                        sitting there and somebody comes up to the counter, what do you look at?
                        What were you...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Kind of everything. Dress. You know, if a person comes in a coat and
                    tie and he's a banker, we give him a visa. And if he comes in work clothes...
                    So, dress, occupation, where does he live, why is he going, things like that. I
                    said it was arbitrary, but there were a lot of clues. A person has a good job
                    and is well dressed, he's a professional person — there's very little question.
                    But many were just workers. A person is a carpenter, doesn't have a checking
                    account, keeps his money in the cabinet at home, he's wearing work clothes. Is
                    this person coming back or is he really going up to see his brother? You don't
                    know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you moved over to the Administrative section. What
                        were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Let me tell you something in between. The Economic Counselor at this
                    post was an alcoholic and I didn't want to work for him. And the Political
                    Counselor, I didn't like his personality. He was strange. So I didn't want to
                    work for either of them. I didn't see a future in it. They weren't what I
                    considered to be role models or what I would consider to be diplomats. So I'm
                    under this rotational program, what am I going to do? I would like to serve in
                    political work, I'd like to serve in economic work, but I don't want to work for
                    either of these people. On the other hand, I had a great personal affinity for
                    the Administrative Counselor. He was a kind of an exuberant, well-liked, popular
                    fellow, competent. So he offered me to come and work for him and I said okay.
                    And so I stayed in the consular section for about a year, first at visas and
                    then I worked too at Protection and Welfare.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell a little about that? Do you have any
                        Protection and Welfare stories or problems that you dealt with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yeah. In Protection and Welfare, my first day we had a death. The
                    death of an American. I didn't have much experience about that, but I learned.
                    An American couple, husband and wife in their 60s I suppose, had come down to
                    Mexico City on a vacation, and he died of a heart attack. That was not that rare
                    because of the altitude in Mexico City. People who have circulatory or heart
                    problems are a little at risk. Also, drinking affects you. So I went over to the
                    hotel and dealt with the hotel people and dealt with the spouse, helped her
                    decide how to get home, what to do with the body, and all that stuff.</p>
                <p>I got called to the jail a lot. One night I got a call, by this time I had been
                    to the police station often. They use a different system in Mexico City. It's
                    not really the jail, it's the police station. The beat officer out on the street
                    doesn't really make arrest decisions. They escort you to the police station if
                    there are any problems, instead of dealing with it themselves. Maybe they're not
                    trained or whatever. A lot of people get taken to the police station and there's
                    a kind of a hearing, it's something that in America would occur on the street,
                    where the policeman gets the facts and decides if you ought to be arrested. So I
                    got calls a lot, and I had learned that the first thing to do was to assure that
                    the person is an American citizen. So I go down to the police station at about
                    6:00 or 7:00 at night and the police bring out the fellow and I ask if he is an
                    American citizen and he says, “No, I'm Canadian.” And I said, “Well, what did
                    you call me for?” And he said, “Oh, Canada's small, America's big. They don't
                    have a duty officer, you do.” So I said that I wasn't authorized to help, but I
                    did speak Spanish, and I am here. I'll make it clear that you're Canadian and
                    see what I can do for you. So I helped get him out of jail.</p>
                <p>Another common thing was automobile accidents. I got called to go to the scene of
                    a lot of accidents. Of course we had a lot of stolen or lost passports, robbed
                    hotel rooms, things like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find there was any problem with payoffs of local
                        officials? Was this a problem, how to deal with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Well, one heard stories all the time about the mordida, the common
                    bribe system. I never used it. I was never asked for any bribes. If I went down
                    to the police station to get somebody out of jail, no, I never offered anything
                    and was never asked for anything. Now it's possible that in some cases where I
                    was unsuccessful that a bribe might have made a difference. But there was no way
                    I was going to bribe them with my own money anyway!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever visit jails, people that were already in
                        jail?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes, we had a murder case. I don't remember the name of it, but it
                    was a very famous case at the time. A wild man, an American, big, 6'4”, 250
                    pounds, who went on a murder spree in Mexico. I think they called him King Kong.
                    The police caught him and put him in jail for murder. I was assigned his case,
                    so I went to see him and some other prisoners. He wasn't really in prison; he
                    was in jail pending trial. On other occasions I went to the prison to see
                    prisoners.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were they treated at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: We used to have a system that the Embassy people collected pocket
                    books and other kinds of materials that we would take to prisoners periodically.
                    So I used to have a little basket of goodies, books or cookies or whatever that
                    I took as a present. The people there, by and large, were familiar with Mexico.
                    They weren't just passing through. So they weren't bothered so much...I mean, if
                    an average American had to suddenly live on tacos, it would be hard. But these
                    folks were either used to it, or whatever. My memory doesn't tell me there were
                    any great hardships there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing when you moved to the Administrative
                        Section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I was kind of an aide to the Administrative Counselor. I spent the
                    bulk of my time on the construction of a new chancery and the move to a new
                    chancery. At that time we were in an office building up over Sanborn's on Paseo
                    de la Reforma, and we were building further down on Reforma a new chancery. It
                    was under construction. I had very little to do with the construction, except
                    for the office layouts. But toward the end of my year we actually moved to the
                    new building and gave up the old. So planning and executing the move absorbed a
                    good portion of my time.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had two Ambassadors when you were there, Thomas Mann
                        and Fulton Freeman. Did you get any feeling for how they operated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yeah. We really liked the Manns. As a junior officer it would be
                    possible that I'd never even meet the Ambassador in a big place like Mexico
                    City. But we were able to meet the Manns. I met him several times and my wife
                    and I got invited to the residence on various occasions. We liked them, and they
                    were popular with junior officers, maybe senior officers too. I also had the
                    impression of competence, ability, but certainly popular with the staff. They
                    left. He became Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs, and Fulton
                    Freeman came. A different type of Ambassador, but they were both career
                    officers. I don't remember if he came toward the end of my time, but we didn't
                    have much contact with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Since you were with the Administrative Section you
                        probably had more to do with Mexicans than any other section. What was your
                        impression of how things operated in Mexico?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: The Mexicans then, I don't know about today, had a minor paranoia
                    about Americans. So they're a little bit...we're the Big Brother to the North
                    kind of thing, they feel second-class, I think. A couple of traits we noticed:
                    they don't like to tell you “No.” I don't know if it was because we were
                    American or if they do that to each other. So they'll tell you “Yes” and then
                    not do it, all the way from craftsmen coming to your house, who is supposed to
                    come at 10:00 and never comes. If you ask him if he's coming he'll say yes.
                    Maybe he has no intention of coming but he says yes. So that causes a little
                    discombobulation. It happens socially too. We were invited to a party from
                    another vice-consul who invited two Mexican couples and we were all going to
                    have pizza and beer and socialize and so forth. She asked them if they were
                    going to come and they said yes, but they didn't come. That was one aspect of
                    it.</p>
                <p>Speaking the language is very important, even though a lot of people speak
                    English. We spoke Spanish, we traveled around everywhere. I dealt with an
                    American business couple who spent a year in Mexico and we got to know. They
                    didn't like the Mexicans and they didn't trust them. I asked them why not and
                    they said, well, they talk about you behind your back and so forth. And I asked
                    him if he spoke Spanish and he said no. So I said, “Well that's your problem. I
                    don't have any of that! You hear them talking but you don't know what they're
                    saying and you make the worst of it.” So we spoke Spanish, we practiced it, we
                    enjoyed it, we traveled, we had good relations, we didn't have any
                    incidents.</p>

                <p>LAUDERDALE: My overriding memory—now—of Mexico was the oppressiveness against
                    junior officers and of the calling card diplomatic calling system and the
                    treatment of wives. Some of my colleagues considered it oppressive even then,
                    but we were wide-eyed and bushy-tailed and we accepted it. My wife and I were
                    29, we had two little boys and a baby by then in Mexico, living in temporary
                    lodging. We had to make 18 calls on Embassy officials - Ambassador, DCM,
                    Counselors, military attach�s, immigration attach�s. 18!! And my wife had to go
                    too, with calling cards and the whole business. We had to find baby sitters,
                    transport. It was a real burden and it created a lot of resentment. Also, there
                    was a consular wives group run by Mrs. Coles, the wife of Leon Coles, who was
                    the Counselor for Consular Affairs. Attendence was mandatory, monthly meetings,
                    periodic, bring your own plate or pot or whatever, always mandatory. That
                    created some resentment. We lived with it, but looking back at it now, it was a
                    lot worse than we realized.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Rio de Janeiro.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a choice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Well, the assignments in those days, you wouldn't believe it. They
                    had a degree of arbitrariness too. No, I was assigned to Tokyo as the Embassy
                    Personnel officer. And the Deputy Executive Director of ARA called me on the
                    phone. I knew him, which was a little unusual for a junior officer, I suppose,
                    to know him, but I did. And he said we want you to go to Rio to be Embassy
                    Personnel Officer. And I said, “I'm quite happy with Tokyo.” But he said, “Yeah,
                    but we want you to say that you want to go to Rio. Anyway, I've talked to
                    Personnel about it and they don't want to let you go, but if you wrote and told
                    them that you want to go, it might just make the difference. And I said: “Well,
                    let me reflect on that, it creates a bit of an ethical problem for me.” So I
                    reflected on it for three or four days and I decided to accede to his wishes. So
                    I wrote a memo to him that said I don't want to go to Tokyo, I want to go to
                    Rio. So they cancelled the assignment and made Tokyo mad and sent me to Rio
                    instead.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation like there in Brazil when
                        you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Very unstable. There had been a revolution, a coup, around six months
                    before I came. The elected president had been ousted and some general had taken
                    over the government as president and the...it was bloodless, by the way. But it
                    looked ominous. GIs on the street, on the city streets of Rio with submachine
                    guns on every corner. They'd scare the hell out of you. But actually there was
                    no violence. It was a military dictatorship at the time, and a real challenge
                    for the United States, because obviously we wanted restoration of democracy, we
                    wanted stability, reliability and so forth. And here you've got a military
                    dictatorship with machine guns in the street.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you first arrived, it was Lincoln Gordon as
                        Ambassador, and it was a very large Embassy, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes, it was big. Big AID Mission, big military mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this comparable to Mexico?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yup.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, what were you as Personnel Officer, what were
                        you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Well there were two sort of broad categories. Nationwide, we had
                    something over 500 Brazilian employees, and the Embassy personnel officer
                    administers their entire system. There's no statute and very few regulations,
                    all the way from recruitment, setting salaries, classification system,
                    promotion, keeping the jobs filled, the people paid, and so forth. That's on the
                    foreign service national side. On the American side also, keeping the post
                    staffed, helping people on the way out to deal with their preferences for onward
                    assignments, welcoming the people that come in, orientation, processing,
                    efficiency reports and all of that stuff, for Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was living at that time in Brazil? Was Brasilia
                        already established at that time, or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: We had in Brasilia a branch office of the Embassy. The capital was
                    still in Rio. Brasilia was under construction, there were some government
                    offices up there, some parliamentary sessions were held there, but none of the
                    ministries had moved yet. We had a branch office up there with three or four
                    people. It was a big Embassy, we had the big question again of planning for the
                    move. Were our FSNs going to move to Brasilia? The Americans you can deal with
                    easily. What about housing for Americans and for FSNs? Also, nobody wanted to
                    move. Not only our employees but nobody in the Brazilian government wanted to
                    move. Yeah, the Embassy was big. It was too big. And Lincoln Gordon's successor
                    fixed that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was Operation Topsy. What was your impression of how
                        Lincoln Gordon operated? Did you get any feel for his work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: We had a military attach� there, Col. Vernon Walters. He was the
                    Defense Attach�, and there was a military government so the president was a
                    general. So he was the principal player in the Embassy. He was Political
                    Counselor, Defense Attach�, Intelligence Officer, Deputy Ambassador; he speaks
                    six languages, was fluent in Portuguese and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And if I recall he had been the liaison officer to the
                        Division which fought in Italy, which the now dictator had served on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes, they had a relationship where they could go for martinis
                    together. In style, Lincoln Gordon I would describe as professorial. Competent,
                    as far as I know, administered U.S government interest with competence. But a
                    lot of the operational, day-to-day stuff was taken care of by Vernon
                    Walters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, were people basically taking orders from the military
                        attach�, as they never would at any other post, I think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Maybe taking orders isn't...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Direction...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I would say that the tone and thrust of the Embassy's view and the
                    Embassy's recommendations to Washington and the Embassy's analysis were dictated
                    by Vernon Walters. And the others obviously had to conform. Whereas normally
                    that might be by the Political Counselor and the Ambassador together.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were still a relatively junior officer there, so
                        you were with the other sort of junior officers there, you know, this was a
                        military dictatorship and all, was this...What was sort of the atmosphere
                        there from your colleagues who were having to deal with the political
                        officers there? Were they, how did they feel about our relations with the
                        Brazilian government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: There were some strains. We didn't know where it was going. We were
                    unhappy with the military dictatorship. We wanted to get them to turn authority
                    back over to the civilians. There were no commitments to do so, in the short
                    term. So it was one of, one might say, frustration. It's not so dissimilar from
                    the situation in Haiti today. I think our relationship, because of the
                    circumstance of Brazil, it's great size, its important economy, it's a much more
                    important relationship and the ties between the two countries are much greater,
                    but some of the frustrations are similar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've never served in Latin America, but I've heard that in
                        Brazil not only the language is different, but the attitude is different,
                        where the United States is not looked upon as the bogeyman of the North,
                        that there is a different attitude toward the United States than there is
                        not only in Mexico, but down in Argentina, where they're always thinking,
                        it's sort of a little paranoia, but that it's not true in Brazil. Did you
                        find that....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes, that is true. It is a different relationship. The Brazilians are
                    completely friendly and open to the United States and to Americans, and to each
                    other! They're not a people or society with a lot of hangups or ulterior
                    motives; one might say simple, pleasant, happy people. We used to laugh about
                    the Brazilian revolution because they're always bloodless, nobody gets
                    killed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about inflation? I don't know if it was at this time
                        or later when one would hear horrific accounts about inflation and all that.
                        Was this a factor when you were there, particularly as a Personnel officer,
                        having to deal with local staff and cost of living for locals and Americans.
                        How did you work it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: It was a big problem. Inflation was great, something like 40% a year.
                    And they had then as they have now provisions where all contracts are adjusted
                    periodically and so forth. Individual Americans had to gauge when and how much
                    money to exchange, whether they should exchange for a week or a day or sometimes
                    an hour! Because the rate would change, often daily, and with FSN salaries it
                    was always a burden. They're behind, you can't do a wage survey every day. Let's
                    say you go six months. In six months they're 20% behind, then it takes
                    Washington a couple of months, with everything having to be sent to Washington.
                    So you have the problem of the lag. It was a chore. We adjusted salaries twice a
                    year and on some occasions gave as much as 40% pay raises.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find Washington could work out a system for
                        dealing with this? I've often heard it said that the American government
                        gets an awful lot from its foreign service nationals but it is not very good
                        in dealing with them in circumstances that are not unique to Brazil. Did you
                        find the machinery antiquated, was there a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Well yeah, it worked a little better at my post, because in the time
                    that I was in the civil service, before I joined the Foreign Service, I had
                    participated in wage surveys. So I knew how to do them and I did the one in
                    Brazil myself. I did the one in Mexico City, when I was there in the
                    Administrative Section. I did a wage survey for foreign Service nationals and
                    did a compensation plan. So I did that in Rio. The problem was the time that it
                    took...first of all you have to wait until the local firms adjust their
                    salaries, and then you have to do the survey, and then you have to send the data
                    to Washington. My view then, as now, which didn't sell by the way, is that when
                    you have inflation of 40% a year and you have to adjust 20% twice a year, let's
                    say, and employees lose money during that time, that 100% accuracy isn't that
                    important. Timeliness is more important. Because if you miss the mark by, say,
                    5% — let's say you raise salaries by 25% when it should have been 20%, two weeks
                    later you're up to date. This great delay and great analysis to avoid making a
                    5% mistake is not worth it. That was my view. So, it's approximately 20%, let's
                    give 'em 20%, let's do it now, and if it's off a little bit it will all come out
                    in the wash. Didn't sell. No, we want the data, we want exactitude, so forth. So
                    we all struggled by somehow.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I can tell you about Operation Topsy, which I think was very
                    interesting. I wasn't there for its execution but I was there for it's
                    beginning. He was an economist. He had been ambassador to the Common Market
                    (USEC). He came to Brazil and found this big Mission that you described, and
                    I'll tell you two or three of his techniques. One was that within the first
                    month I got called up as Embassy Personnel Officer. He called up me and the
                    doctor, and the Administrative Counselor and he said: “I'm very worried about
                    the health of this community. An AID officer had a heart attack last week,
                    everybody's charging around trying to conquer the world and move the earth and
                    the pace of life here is very hectic. Let's slow this down! So, we're going to
                    have some rules. Thursday afternoons is volleyball on the beach. Recreation and
                    exercise. No representational activity on the weekend. I'm not going to host any
                    except for force majeure, diplomatic necessity. But this routine stuff is going
                    to be during the week and I expect weekends to be family time. I'm going to slow
                    this pace down. We're going to stop setting unrealistic deadlines, we're going
                    to stop causing people to have heart attacks. We're going to pay more attention
                    to health and so forth. So, go work out the details.”</p>

                <p>So that was one meeting. Another meeting was with AID. He said to them: “I see

                <p>“Well, don't the Brazilians have hydro-engineers?”</p>
                <p>“Yeah, but ours are better.”</p>
                <p>And he said, “I don't care if ours are better. Let Brazilian engineers do this.
                    We don't need American engineers down here to build Brazilian dams. They can
                    build their own dams.”</p>
                <p>So he put AID working on a different concept, even though (it reminds me of the
                    Vietnam war) “Americans can do it better,” this is their country, let them do
                    it, and so forth.</p>
                <p>So he slowed the pace down, he cut down the concept of what Americans needed to
                    do and what the Brazilians could do. Once he did that, he said, “Now we've got
                    too many people. We can cut this place by 25% or 15%,” and put it into
                    effect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how did the bureaucracy respond to that? Because one
                        of the things that I think is endemic in the Foreign Service is this rushing
                        all over the place and doing things that I think in retrospect, now that you
                        and I are both retired, you kind of wonder what was all the rushing about?
                        How did you find the system, at the early stages, responded to this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I really respected his technique. Before then and since then I've
                    been involved in retrenching government. The history of the Foreign Service is
                    retrenchment, just about. Cutting back. Establishing new programs with no new
                    resources, you've gotta cut old ones. And I've learned over the years that there
                    are basically two ways to do that and I've seen both tried. One is, you just cut
                    staff, you cut an Embassy, you tell an Embassy you can't have four political
                    officers you can only have three, we're going to cut one. Now you guys work out
                    how you're going to cut the work. I never liked that system. Because what I find
                    is that Foreign Service people in particular are ego-driven, they're end-product
                    driven, and they'll work themselves to death trying to do the same old
                    thing.</p>
                <p>The other way to cut, or retrench, is to cut the work first. Cut the work first,
                    then cut the staff. That's what Tuthill did. He cut the work first by
                    challenging it. What is all this rushing around? Who says this has to be done by
                    Friday? I think this could be done by September 15th, it's quite enough. Why do
                    you need an American engineer? Why can't you use Brazilians? So you cut down the
                    expectations, cut down the demands. Then you can say: “Now we can cut staff by
                    15%.” I consider that really professional.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find... were there any... in your dealings
                        because anything particularly when you're dealing with an administration
                        you're always up against your opposite number. How did you find the
                        Brazilian government as a deliverer, particularly now as it was under
                        military rule?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: On the administrative side, it worked, with airport arrivals and
                    departures, customs and immigration, with the thousands of interchange things
                    that we have, it all worked. We talked about the mordida in Mexico, in Brazil
                    they have a word called “jeito.” You pull a jeito. What is a jeito? A jeito is a
                    deal. It's not a bribe, it's a favor. You get things done with jeitos. So we had
                    some jeitos. What is it? It's smoothing relationships, maintaining... of course
                    we sent over our Christmas gratuities and so forth. But I don't remember any
                    particular head-to-head dealings with the Brazilian government on the
                    administrative side.</p>

                        visas and all that, because people would only get visas if they really had a
                        reason to come to the United States and probably come back. So that didn't
                        turn into...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: No, no visa mill there. Our consular section was quite small. Had
                    three or four Americans only. No great non-immigrant visa lines. Most of the
                    people who applied, qualified. It was a completely different environment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression...we had what, three or four
                        consular posts there? It's a big country, what was your impression of how
                        they were used, their utility and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: They had one down in Porto Alegre, one up north in Belem, we had one
                    in Curitiba which later got closed. We had one in Salvador, Bahia. Recife, we
                    had not only a consulate there but an AID Mission. Some of those have been
                    closed since that time. Some of those still survive to this day. I think they
                    were probably all appropriate in those days. The only ones I might question was
                    Curitiba, which we closed. I don't know if we need a post in Porto Alegre. I
                    don't know if we need a post in Belem. Salvador, probably yes. Recife, probably
                    yes. Because the distances are so great. From Rio to Recife you're talking 1,000
                    miles, so you need a little presence up there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any problem with staffing or keeping Brasilia
                        going during the time you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: In the posts yes, we seemed to have problems in the posts. In Belem,
                    when the inspectors came they relieved a couple of people; they relieved the
                    principal officer in Belem. I think he was sleeping with the female USIS officer
                    or something. And maybe not coming to work every day. And staffing Brazilian
                    posts was always a bit of a problem; I guess one thing is the Portuguese
                    language. They used to have a Portuguese language school in Rio in the old days,
                    which they had to close. So keeping people, new officers speaking
                    Portuguese...So one thing I spent some time on was keeping the posts staffed.
                    The problem in Rio was just the numbers. In the posts it was sometimes
                    personalities, people didn't want to go, so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Brasilia itself? Was it hard to get people to
                        go, from what I gather...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: It was a frontier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the whole idea. Was it Kubitschek, or the

                        Brazilians away from the coast and out into the interior.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: You're right. People didn't want to go. The only asset Brasilia had
                    was a beautiful blue sky. It was a great flat plain, the climate wasn't that
                    bad. But there was absolutely nothing to do, nowhere to go. So people didn't
                    want to go, and those that went used to use the shuttle to Rio pretty
                    regularly.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to ask, having never served there, did Mardi Gras
                        pretty much shut things down in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Absolutely. Just closed down. As a matter of fact my wife and I
                    bought tickets and we were going to see the Mardi Gras parade, and we had
                    children at home. We had a maid, but we forgot to check with her. So as soon as
                    Mardi Gras came she said “Adios, I'll be back next Tuesday.” And we said, “Wait
                    a minute.” But we had to let her go. But we found a babysitter somehow to go to
                    one parade. I'm never going back. We went down about midnight and left at about
                    three in the morning. I guess we went down at eleven o'clock, but the parade
                    didn't begin until midnight. It's nice, it's worth seeing, but you wouldn't want
                    to do it twice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a post, let's do a little compare and contrast, how
                        would you compare Mexico and Rio in those days in terms of people?Were there
                        any differences?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yeah. For Americans, Brazil is a better place to live. The living
                    conditions in Mexico City were better than in Rio, but the relationships with
                    the Brazilian people were a lot better, it's a lot more open, it's a lot
                    friendlier. You feel less threatened. So I think the relationship between the
                    two countries and between the two people's were probably more friendly with the
                    Brazilians, and that's why I think it's a better place for Americans to live. In
                    terms of amenities, Mexico City in those days was superior to Rio, but that may
                    not be true today.</p>

                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yeah I believe he was.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: You know, I don't know. Maybe about that time I left. I left shortly
                    after Tuthill...he'd only been there three or six months. So either the
                    relationship wasn't settled by the time I left... I don't have any particular
                    memory of it. I think Walters may have left also, maybe a little after I
                    did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well with Walters, because he is such a phenomenon, when
                        he was there during the Lincoln Gordon time, did you sense any resentment on
                        the part of the Political Section there, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: No, not particularly. Frank Carlucci was the Political Counselor,
                    another officer that was there was Sam Lewis, Bob Ryan was in Econ. He was a
                    young officer like myself. He and I and Frank Carlucci used to go out to lunch
                    pretty regularly. Max Krebs was Political Counselor before Carlucci. I don't
                    remember anything Max Krebs said. It wasn't anything that Frank Carlucci
                    complained about.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Herb Okun there at that time?</hi>

                <p>LAUDERDALE: Herb Okun was up in Brasilia.</p>
                <p>

                        came into the Foreign Service with Herb. I heard that he was a little bit
                        difficult to deal with when he was up in Brasilia.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes, he was. But if I can digress, I was later in the Embassy in
                    Spain when Franco was still in power. He died during my tour. But the situation
                    was not that different. Under a military dictatorship like Franco and Madras (of
                    Haiti), and whatever his name was in Brazil, where generals are in power, the
                    contacts are military contacts. And the source of information is Intelligence.
                    So in Spain, guess what I found? The CIA Mission is important. Military attach�s
                    are important. What does the Political Section do? Very little. What do you read
                    in the newspaper? Nothing. Parliamentarians to talk to? No. So the Intelligence
                    and the military side of the house was predominant. It changed in Spain while I
                    was there when Franco died. We had to change the staffing. We need econ
                    officers, we need political officers. You can cut the Intelligence out. I think
                    that they accepted that as inevitable under a military dictatorship.</p>

                        was this, did you ask for this or...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: No. I was assigned to Kinshasa. I didn't want to go, either. I had a
                    diabetic son and I was really quite annoyed, because I put in a preference sheet
                    or whatever it was called, it was completely ignored, they assigned me to
                    Kinshasa. I called AF/EX on the phone one day and said, “Look, I don't know if I
                    can go to Kinshasa. I have a son that's a diabetic.” And they said, “Forget
                    about it. We're going to send you anyway. Med says its okay.” So I dropped it.
                    Before I left Rio, in the hustle-bustle of moving, of packing up at home, we
                    forgot to give our son his insulin shot in the morning. Got up in the morning,
                    7:00, we're packing, drinking coffee standing up, and at noon he flips over and
                    we rush him to the hospital, and then we remembered, we didn't give him his
                    insulin shot. So he stayed in the hospital until evening, as I recall, came back
                    home, scared us all. But in the process we contacted the Regional Medical
                    Officer and it came out that we were going to Kinshasa. And he said: “You
                    shouldn't go to Kinshasa.” And I said, “Well, I told them that. They raised that
                    and they said that Med said it was okay.” So he said: “You go to see Med when
                    you get to Washington. See the medical director. They're a big bureaucracy just
                    like everything else. You just got lost in the system. You go tell him your
                    circumstance and they're not going to send you to Kinshasa.” So I said okay.
                    When I got to Washington we went to FSI-French. Like most Administrative
                    officers I could not be spared for the full program, which was 16 weeks. They
                    said you can have 8 weeks. So I was enrolled at FSI for 8 weeks. For my son's
                    medical exam they don't do them at the medical division, you do it privately. We
                    took him up to Boston, to the Jocelyn Clinic, which is a world-famous diabetic
                    clinic. We had lived in Boston, so we knew about it. We took him up to Boston
                    for in-patient observation and insulin adjustment. He's a growing boy who's been
                    overseas. We took him up to the Jocelyn Clinic and left him for five days. Then
                    I went back to get him. When they got finished they wrote a two-page letter to
                    Med. about his clearance. I gave the letter to Med., meantime I'm still assigned
                    to Kinshasa. Med said, you're not going to Kinshasa. Mr. Hume Horan who was the
                    Personnel Officer in AF, was nasty to me about that. He said “Oh, I notice you
                    went to an out-of-town doctor, as if there was something sneaky about this whole
                    thing. Anyway, they cancelled it. So here I am in French, and no job. And the
                    Personnel system was not centralized at that time. It was decentralized, each
                    bureau had a personnel officer. They had a central coordinator and I went to see
                    him. Because I went to AF and they said they didn't have anything for me. I went
                    to the central coordinator and he said: “Well, we're planning an expansion in
                    Brussels for the NATO move. We're going to create an additional job there as
                    Embassy GSO. I've got three choices: Frankfurt, commercial officer; Lisbon,
                    commercial officer; Brussels, GSO. Frankfurt, the guy extended; Lisbon,
                    something else happened. Anyway, I went to Brussels as assistant GSO. New
                    Position in anticipation of the NATO move. So after my 8 weeks in French I went
                    to Brussels.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me, I know everything was in flux back then, but you
                        would end up kind of being coned. In a sense you were typed as an economic,
                        political, consular, or administrative officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: You became typed, but I hadn't been typed yet.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about concentrating sort of on the
                        adminstrative side of this and that. What was sort of the atmosphere. Where
                        did one want to be as a type of officer. I speak as...I found myself getting
                        typed as a consular officer and everybody told me “Don't be one.” But gee, I
                        liked the work and I kind of stayed on longer than people thought was a good
                        idea in those days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: As I recall it was about two years later that the coning process
                    occurred. As long as the question of coning didn't come up, I didn't really
                    care. I would have preferred, for substantive reasons, either of the other two
                    kinds of job. But for other reasons they didn't work out, so I wasn't unhappy
                    about this one. While in Brussels, they came out with this system they're going
                    to cone everybody and the first cut they're going to cone you in the work you're
                    now in. And under that formula I would become administrative cone, and you had a
                    right to appeal. So when I was next in Washington I went to see the central
                    Personnel people about whether I should appeal or whether I should accept it. So
                    one of the things I asked them was... by then they had the newly centralized
                    Personnel system... one of the questions I asked them was about the role and
                    future of adminstrative people in the Foreign Service. Because they didn't have
                    any tradition of that. I asked them, for example, can I get to the top as an
                    Administrative Officer? Can I aspire to be an ambassador as an Administrative
                    Officer? I got a lot of coughing. Coughing and hhhmmming. I never got a straight
                    answer. The answer was, it depends and so forth. So in the end I accepted it. I
                    didn't appeal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Brussels when you got there? it
                        was not the Embassy to NATO at that time, am I right? It was a straight
                        Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how did you find the Embassy, how it operated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: There were two Missions in Brussels at that time: USEC, which was the
                    Mission to the Common Market at that time, kind of small; and the Embassy, which
                    was accredited to the government of Belgium, which was also kind of small. It
                    was by and large a sleepy...I would call it kind of a sleepy, unimportant
                    Mission. The Administrative Officer, for example, was an FSO-2, to give you an
                    idea of level. By the time I arrived, it was getting ginned up. And the next
                    year was very, very hectic. We spent the year planning for the move of starting
                    in January of '67, and NATO was going to move in September of '67. So we had
                    about nine months to plan for that move.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Ambassador when you arrived was, what, Ridgway
                        Knight?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I used to call him the Consul General, because that's how he acted.
                    After coming from Mexico City and Rio, where I was lucky even to meet the
                    Ambassador, here I was at a post where no detail was too small. I met the
                    Ambassador every day, and he would tell me where the flowers ought to go in the
                    lobby. So I used to call him the Consul General.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a post, how did people like it there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: The people who were there liked it. Brussels was very convenient
                    living. Our relationship with the Belgian government was very friendly, the
                    issues with the Belgian government were very few. We were both NATO members, the
                    Common Market's there, so very few strains, lots of amenities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Congo had ceased to be an issue then? It had been, I
                        suppose, five years earlier.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: We had broken relationships with Iraq, and the Belgians were the
                    protecting power in Iraq, so one of our more important relationships with the
                    Belgians was practically every day going to the Belgian Foreign Office about
                    Iraq.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is after the '67 Arab-Israeli War and many of the
                        Arab states broke relations with us.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, how does one go about all of a sudden having NATO
                        headquarters dumped on them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Well, they had to decide what kind of headquarters building to build.
                    They couldn't build a permanent headquarters during the time allowed, so they
                    found a site and decided to build a temporary headquarters, with the idea that
                    they would later build a permanent headquarters in another part of the city. A
                    permanent one being brick and steel and opposed to this one, which is stucco,
                    low-rise, that looks kind of like an army camp, temporary building for NATO.
                    That was for the office side of the house. We had to have a school. There was an
                    American school in Brussels that was where most of the American business
                    community and Embassy kids went, but it could not accomodate the great influx.
                    They were going to get 200-300 more students and they couldn't accomodate them.
                    And they didn't want to expand to that scope. So the U.S. Army decided to build
                    a school. So NATO's out there building their headquarters, the Army's coming in,
                    buying land to build a school. Then we've got the question of housing for all
                    these people. We decided to go government lease. So in addition from the U.S.
                    Mission moving from Paris, there's also a military committee of NATO that's
                    headquartered in Washington, and they decided to move it to Brussels
                    simultaneously with the NATO. Between the military committee and the U.S.
                    Mission to NATO, we're going to get over 200 people, 200 employees. So the
                    number of housing units, as I recall, was 213, so we decided to go government
                    lease. So we had to lease and furnish 213 housing units. So you've got three
                    things going simultaneously: headquarters office building by U.S. NATO, school
                    by U.S. Army, Embassy and a joint adminstrative section — of course NATO's not
                    even there, so the Embassy Adminstrative Section has to do all the
                    administrative work. We've got to locate 213 or so housing units, furnish them,
                    all by September. I was scared!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, you're in competition with all the other Embassies
                        of NATO who were doing the same thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I went out as assistant GSO. In the meantime I became the GSO, and by
                    the summer I got two American assistant GSOs. I'll grant you, I was only an
                    FSO-5 myself and they were FSO-6s, or something like that. Much too junior and
                    much too few to do this massive job. So as I say, I was scared. And I never
                    worked harder in my life, seven days a week, from January to December. I took no
                    vacation that year. Nobody did. We were overloaded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Belgians respond to this influx. Both at the
                        government level and the real level, that is, the Belgians who were living
                        in Brussels?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: The government responded positively. How the people felt about it? I
                    don't remember exactly, but my recollection is favorably. The kind of aura at
                    the time was that Brussels was going to become the capital of Europe. With NATO
                    here and the Common Market here, this is going to become an important business,
                    commercial, diplomatic center, why we're going to be the capital of Europe!</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a real problem with pricing? With the
                        competition and all I'd imagine that you found yourself competing for
                        housing and all, trying to outbid each other. Was this a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: We had difficulty finding units, but price wasn't really the problem.
                    Belgium was kind of expensive anyway. But I don't remember any great rent
                    escalation and getting there first. It may be that we were ahead of the others,
                    even though our numbers were so much greater.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting help from the US Army, coming out there,
                        or the NATO side, or did they depend on you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: They depended on us. Most of the military help came later. After NATO
                    was established, or just before or simultaneously with it, there was a NATO
                    support group that came that was military that worked closely with the Embassy
                    and helped a lot with visits and other things. But in this process that I'm
                    talking about, they were not a player.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did John Eisenhower...when did he come there? After NATO
                        was already in or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: After the election. The Nixon election in '69. Ridgway Knight was
                    summarily replaced... he read about his replacement by John Eisenhower in the
                    wireless bulletin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Low key, kind of a loner. I don't mean loner in the normal sense of
                    the world. He had no close associations. He didn't take up with the professional
                    corps on a comrade basis, and he had no private friends. He felt alone, and he
                    said so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was sort of an odd...he was the son of the president,
                        but it didn't fit one way or the other. Later he became...his son married
                        Julie Nixon, but that wasn't in the offing at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: No, she was a young girl in Brussels at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for how Belgians felt about Germany
                        and Germany was in NATO at that time. Was this a problem?</hi>

                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I think that, at least on the surface, the animosities of World War
                    II were pretty much behind them at that time. Now, I had been in Belgium
                    earlier, when I was a GI in Germany in the '50s, and it was active then. The war
                    memories were still fresh. But now in '69, I didn't hear anything about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was different, the Dutch harbored these things
                        much longer, there may be reasons, but both suffered quite badly during
                        World War II but the Belgians seem to be a different breed of cat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: You're right about the Dutch. I was more aware of the Dutch
                    sensibilities about it than the Belgian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was another manifestation not on the German side but
                        against us, about Vietnam. The Dutch were giving us a very difficult time,
                        I'm talking about students, people on the streets and all, about our role in
                        Vietnam, but you never hear about it in Belgium.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: You had some, they wrote graffiti on our building sometimes. It was
                    not the way it was in some other countries, but there was some.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the African business? Of course Belgium by this
                        time had no Rwanda, Burundi, the Congo, or Zaire. Did these play any role?
                        Were things happening there where we were on one side and they were on the
                        other, or were you...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I'm not aware of any. My overriding memory of events during my time
                    was the NATO side of the house and the invasion of Czechoslovakia that occurred
                    while I was there. That kind of put NATO on alert, so they were on their toes
                    there. And the U.S. forces along the East German border was a source of tension.
                    It may have had some spillover in terms of the Belgians, but you know the
                    Germans were now the front line. They were the guardians of liberty and the
                    buffer between the Russians and the Belgians. So that may have influenced their
                    attitude.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude about the Soviet threat at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I think we might talk about two parts of it: one, the Communist
                    philosophical threat and the other would be the Soviet military threat. The
                    Communist philosophical threat, by and large the Europeans, including the
                    Belgians, thought the Americans were paranoid. Being Social Democrats,
                    socialists they called themselves openly, they don't consider the Communist
                    philosophy all that threatening or all that ominous, and they think the
                    Americans are overboard about it. So they were never that greatly concerned
                    about the non-military inroads of Communism or the threats of Communist
                    domination of countries in Africa and so forth. They more or less shrugged and
                    said, “So what? “What's the threat?</p>
                <p>Now on the military side there's obviously some concern, and events such as those
                    that occurred in Czechoslovakia [the 1968 crushing of liberalization in
                    Czechoslovakia by the Soviets and their satellites], brought to the fore
                    realization that there is a significant military threat and that there is a big
                    army on the German border, and we are all to some degree vulnerable, and we need
                    NATO and we need the American forces in Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Embassy in Brussels play any role in helping our
                        Embassy in Luxembourg, by any chance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Marginally. Yes, I mean not so much that we were a regional support
                    center or anything like that, but when they needed help they called us and we
                    always responded. It could be supply or technical assistance or even advice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, you left in 1970, right? You came back at last
                        to Washington. What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I went to the University of Michigan to mid-career university
                    training. That was nine months of an academic year, and it was called Management
                    Training. I had the choice of Systems Training or Management Training. Half a
                    dozen or so administrative officers had gone off the previous year and most of
                    them had taken Systems. People like Bob Lamb, Tom Tracy, and some of the others.
                    I took Management Training. Like all my other assignments, that ones was screwed
                    up too. I got a letter that said I had been picked for Columbia University. I
                    wrote back, or called back and said: “I have four children. Ain't no way I can
                    live in New York City. You got the wrong place.” After some embarrassing
                    reevaluations they offered me four, more rural locales: Ann Arbor,
                    Pennsylvania...anyway, I took Ann Arbor. Probably a bad choice, but...</p>

                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Later in my career, I realized that it was the right thing to do and
                    it was quite helpful to me. At the time, I wasn't sure, and even my colleagues
                    thought that it really wouldn't make any difference. You'll either get to the
                    top or not. But I think it was worthwhile and I'm glad I did it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you find that you studied that came in handy
                        later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: One of the best courses I had was Organizational Theory. I used that
                    a lot, later on in my career, even when I was in OIG. So that was the best
                    course I had. I had a course in Personnel Administration and a course in
                    Organizational Behavior which also was quite good. You know, the graduate school
                    of business curriculum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you came back to Washington in '71, or was it still
                        '70?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: No, in June of '71 I came back here. I was a post management officer
                    in EUR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find EUR? EUR always seems to do better for
                        itself than any of the other bureaus. Was this your impression?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Do you mean in the way of resources?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, both in terms of people and resources.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes, I found it then and I find it now with a footnote — they got
                    there first. A simple answer. China has operated on a shoestring because
                    relations got established later. Now establishment of all these new posts, the
                    Eastern European posts, has just about bankrupted EUR, because they had to
                    absorb that out of all their existing... So I think that may have changed that
                    finally. But they were an old-time bureau, they had a base, they had a
                    superstructure, and I think they've fared well over the years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does a post management officer do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: We provide liaison, support, and feedback to the Embassy on the full
                    range of administrative and managerial problems that they communicate with us
                    about.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this in '71-'72, what were your main issues
                        that you were dealing with at post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I had basically Western Europe, Great Britain, Italy, Iberia, the
                    Netherlands, and Scandinavia. So I could handle ten countries with one hand tied
                    behind me, because they didn't have really big problems. Aside from the budget,
                    the budget was the most complicated thing to handle. A couple that I can think
                    of... I got a lot of letters to the Secretary from tourists who complained that
                    they were in Rome and went by the Embassy and the flag wasn't flying. I got
                    maybe ten in my first summer, all addressed to the Secretary of State, but they
                    came down to me for reply. So I communicated with Rome about this and I got
                    brushed off. Rome said, “Well, it's the Italian Government. Foreign missions fly
                    the flag only on flag days. Furthermore our flagpole is in the interior
                    courtyard and you couldn't see it from the street anyway.” So I communicated
                    back and said, “I'd like for you to go to the Foreign Ministry and tell them
                    that in the absence of any major objection, we intend to begin flying the flag
                    every day.” The Embassy didn't want to do that. They didn't want to fly the flag
                    and they didn't want to go to the Foreign Ministry. I said: “Look, I don't want
                    to answer letters from tourists to the Secretary. This is a cheap price to pay.
                    And besides, we fly the flag everyplace else in the world. So do it.” So they
                    did, and guess what the Italians said? “We don't care. Go right ahead. In
                    general we don't like flags all over the city, but... Besides, we can't see
                    yours anyway.” So they started flying the flag and the letters stopped. While
                    it's true they couldn't see it from the street, if they asked the guard he'd
                    say, “Oh, it's right in there.” And they could walk over and see it.</p>
                <p>Another one that I remember was a cable from Copenhagen, or the Hague, that said,
                    our xerox machines are costing us so many thousands a year and we could buy a
                    xerox machine for the price of one year's rental. So send us the purchase money
                    and we'll buy one and we'll save it in rent during the next year alone. And I
                    said, “I don't have any money. But I have an idea. Just take all your rental
                    money and buy the thing October 1. Then you don't need any money from me. “ They
                    thought that was a good idea. With the new fiscal year...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then off you went again. Clint, we're now going to Bonn,
                        where you served from '72 to '75. How did that job come about, and what were
                        you up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Well, I was in the Department. I was working for Joan Clark at that
                    time, who was Executive Director, and the question of my assignment came up. I
                    wanted to go to Vienna, but she wanted to send somebody else. She wanted me to
                    go to Moscow and be Admin. Counselor. I said: “I have two high school children
                    and Moscow has no high school. So I don't want to go to Moscow.” She said: I
                    want you to go to Moscow! We need you.” So I said “I have two teenaged children
                    and I don't want to send them to boarding school.” So she said okay, we'll send
                    you to Bonn. So off I went to Bonn and served three years. Marty Hillenbrand was
                    the Ambassador at that time. Actually, he went out when I went out. So we went
                    out together.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What had you heard about Marty Hillenbrand in the
                        corridors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: He was a top-flight, career officer Ambassador. At that time he was
                    Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, highly respected, a German
                    expert by the way. He had served there earlier in his career several times. I
                    got to know him personally and really liked him. He was kind of self-effacing,
                    low key, completely non-aggressive. More of a passive personality, but a real
                    professional. That by the way was what got him fired later. That kind of
                    personality and approach... I'll jump forward to two or three years later when
                    Henry Kissinger was Secretary of State, and during those years he came to Bonn
                    13 times during my time there. And because of Hillenbrand's very low-key
                    approach, because of his, one might say, really diplomatic dealing with the
                    German government, he wasn't tough enough for Kissinger, and Kissinger basically
                    said so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there at the time? Did you see this
                        developing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I was there, but I wasn't in on...you know when Secretary Kissinger
                    comes he meets with Foreign Minister Genscher, and he meets with the Chancellor
                    and the President. Hillenbrand was in some of those meetings and I was not. So I
                    don't have any first hand...in fact I don't even know what the issue was. I know
                    Kissinger had come back after shuttling through the Middle East to put the heat
                    on the Germans about something, I don't remember, but I do know that the word
                    got around that Hillenbrand didn't present the issue to the Germans forcefully
                    enough. So he basically said: “He's not tough enough, so we're going to let him
                    go and get somebody else.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who came in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: You know, I don't remember. A little bit later it was Stoessel, but I
                    think there was an Ambassador in between. I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were out there in '72 how did you find...because
                        we're looking not only at the political situation but also at how the system
                        runs. What was your impression about how our Bonn Embassy, a huge Embassy,
                        was run at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: A couple of the things that came up. After the war, HICOG was in
                    Frankfurt, a big institution settled in Frankfurt in consfiscated offices and so
                    forth. The German government had been given the contractual agreement i.e.
                    sovereignty, of the three Western occupied areas, and they decided to set up
                    headquarters in Bonn. So the U.S. government built a big complex there under two
                    different circumstances. They built a big housing complex on land that the
                    United States government owned. They had either purchased it or the government
                    gave it to them. I don't know what the arrangement was. But I know that the U.S.
                    government owned the land under a 400 or 500 unit apartment complex, with
                    shopping center, school, club, service organizations, movies, a church. A town,
                    a little town. The office building was a little bit different circumstance. We
                    built the building on German land, with the understanding that we would have the
                    building for as long as we wanted it. That was the circumstance in Frankfurt
                    also.</p>
                <p>When I went, the office complex that had been built in '48 was much too big for
                    the Embassy. We had given almost half of it back to the Germans and we occupied
                    the other half. Also, by that time it was almost 30 years old. It had to be
                    rehabilitated, a major face lift. Or we had to build a new chancery. So there
                    was a proposal in the mill to build a chancery in Bonn. That came to a head
                    about the time Hillenbrand and I came to Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just some historical background. Nobody was even
                        foreseeing that Germany would be unified at any point in the foreseable
                        future at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: No. It became more clear later. Within about five years there was a
                    consensus that Germany would never be reunified. And Kissinger and some others
                    at some point said that there was no reason to believe that Germany would ever
                    be reunified. However, there was also always that glimmer of hope. Hillenbrand
                    killed the new chancery project, for exactly the reasons we're discussing here.
                    His public reason was that it would send the wrong signal politically. It would
                    tell the Russians and the East Germans and the eastern bloc that the U.S. has
                    accepted the division of Germany and they have built a 100-year chancery in
                    Bonn. He didn't want to send that signal, even though nobody believed
                    reunification would occur in the near future, he said we're not going to do
                    anything like this that sends a signal of acceptability and stability in Bonn.
                    No. No chancery. So eventually they rehabilitated the office building. And it
                    turned out that was wise. Because what happened in the '90s was completely
                    unexpected! I thought they'd made a bad mistake, that we were going to build a
                    new chancery in the parking lot so we'd have a place to live while it was under
                    construction, and when the chancery was finished we'd tear down the old stuff.
                    But it didn't happen, we stayed in the old windy chancery. It was really what
                    was called a temporary building, like the old buildings on Constitution Ave.
                    that were built during World War II and then kind of hang on forever. That's the
                    kind of building it was.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you find dealing with the Germans? On the
                        official side, first.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Very pleasant, very cordial, very responsive. I dealt with them
                    mostly on management issues of course, including security, property issues. They
                    were very cooperative. I don't want to overstate the case, but we got just about
                    everything we wanted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You spoke of security issues. Was this the period when you
                        had terrorists, like the Bader- Meinhof gang? These were basically radical
                        “students” who were going around killing and bombing and doing things.
                        Basically anarchists. They were quite a threat. Can you talk about
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes I can and I can tell you about an incident that occurred that
                    kind of clarified our policy on the issue. The Bader-Meinhof gang were setting
                    of bombs and doing other terrorist acts throughout Germany, mostly against the
                    Germans or against the American military. A bomb went off in Frankfurt, at Rhein
                    Main Air Base. And threats were made against the American Embassy. We just had
                    German civilian guards, as I recall they were unarmed. And no great number, a
                    couple of guards at the gate, that's it. It was perceived that there was a need
                    for much more security, so when...actually I think it was just before I came
                    when the Admin. Counselor was away from the post, something happened, and the
                    Embassy brought in the American Military Police. He came back to the post and
                    the Embassy was surrounded by American Military Police, and he knew that this
                    was not right. This is not how we protect our Embassies abroad. Protecting our
                    Embassies abroad is the responsibility of the host government, and a lot of
                    things can go wrong if you have the American Military Police surrounding it. So
                    he convinced the Ambassador, the one before Hillenbrand to get the Military
                    Police out of our compound. We talked to the Germans and got them to send the
                    Bundeswehr, the border police. So the border police came in, this was in April
                    or May of '72, and guarded the Embassy and they have been doing it ever since,
                    to this day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any actual incidents against the Embassy while
                        you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: No. We spent a lot of energy and time and effort on security. We
                    built a fence around the compound, the border guards brought armored cars,
                    tank-looking like vehicles, in the housing compound which was five miles down
                    the road, no fence around the property, no real armed presence. That was all
                    beefed up. More police. In subsequent years a fence was built, barriers were
                    built and so forth. But no incident while I was there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have Marines there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes, but they had no role at all in the housing compound, except to
                    live there. They were chancery oriented. Their duty stations were in the
                    chancery, they didn't really provide perimeter security. Unless you have a
                    fence, then within that compound they protect the entry. But we had no fence,
                    wide open, any stroller could walk through or by. So they were inside, front
                    door. We spent a lot of money on access control: bulletproof windows,
                    shatterproof glass, that kind of stuff. They were more concerned in those days
                    about individual terrorists, that a terrorist or a couple of terrorists might
                    get into the chancery, into the consular section, into the public areas, with a
                    briefcase with a bomb in it. So we established very strict...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in, at this time, from '70 to '74 I was...a bomb
                        went off in our parking lot and killed the two people who were going to set
                        off the bomb. There was a lot of that going around in those days. These were
                        an Italian radical and a Cypriot radical, I think, and they blew themselves
                        up, thank God.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yeah, they had the Japanese Red Army, Bader-Meinhof, and there was a
                    group in Italy, the Red Brigade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could comment, what is and was your
                        impression of the Marines as a protective force. I've heard people say that
                        because they're young they get into more trouble, and it would be better to
                        have more a civilian, older group. How did you feel about the Marines?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yeah, I felt good about 'em, I felt it was worthwhile, I felt we
                    ought to have them. Then, that every Embassy ought to have Marines. I think it
                    is important to have a clear understanding of the Marines' mission. Their
                    mission as I understand it is to protect American classified material. They are
                    the guardians of our code facilities, really, our classified material and our
                    code books, and within the Embassy itself the sanctity of that as a haven, as a
                    refuge. Even the host country authorities, the police, the fire, no one can come
                    inside that chancery without our permission. And the mechanism by which that is
                    implemented is by the Marine guards. Also, in dealing with individual
                    terrorists, individual troublemakers, such as the kind you may get in any
                    country — a person comes into a bank and makes a scene — you need “security” to
                    come and escort them out. The Marines can do that. They do it, they do it very
                    well. They speak English, they're American, they're trained. And I think the
                    thing we learned in Tehran, when the hostages were taken, is that it's not
                    foolproof. Basically it's a delaying mechanism. The Marines are supposed to be
                    able to delay entry of any group long enough to give the communicators and the
                    code people time to destroy the codes and the classified material. That may be
                    minutes or hours, the more they have the more they can destroy. But that's
                    basically what it's for, and to prevent surreptitious or illegal or unknown
                    entry outside office hours. So I consider them guardians of our codes and
                    classified materials, our comm. centers, and so forth. And I think they do it
                    very well. Now if you want a Delta Force to destroy the invaders and so forth
                    then the Marines are the wrong ones. They're not equipped for that, they're not
                    suitable for that. They're American citizens in a foreign country. For that you
                    need the German border police, that's what they're out there for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the German local employees, the foreign
                        service nationals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Competent, efficient, but a little bit hard to control. The two go
                    together. Because they're educated, they're trained, I guess basically they're
                    not willing to accept a second-class status. And our Foreign Service national
                    employment system is based on a two-tier, sort of a second-class citizen
                    relationship. The Americans are American diplomats, they're foreigners, they
                    have their role and the others are the clerks and the bookkeepers, the
                    accountants and the maintenance people, and ipso facto they are lower in the
                    pecking order. The Germans had a little trouble with that relationship and you
                    sometimes had to slap one down a little bit because he was too uppity vis-a-vis
                    taking orders from Washington, or whatever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well also I speak as...I went out to Frankfurt as my first
                        post, as a young vice-consul, not knowing anything, and here I was
                        supervising people who knew a lot more about whatever it was than I did.
                        It's a little hard for them. They keep having these new people coming in and
                        telling them what to do, and they often do it better. Were there anything
                        equivalent with labor troubles while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Not in the Embassy. The Amry and Air Force had a long history of
                    labor troubles, in the sense that the Germans have a fairly strict labor law,
                    they have employee protection systems. And of course the Army and Air Force are
                    used to sovereign immunity, doing as they damn please. So they were fairly
                    regularly...if they wanted to close down a base, or cut the staff at the
                    officer's club or something and lay off ten Germans, the Labor Ministry was over
                    talking to us to get the Army to... You know we had about 250,000 military
                    troops throughout Germany during most of the time I was there, and dependents
                    added on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find... I mean you were kind of the mayor of
                        this rather unruly group. Diplomats are very nice, but when you put
                        diplomats and their families all together, they don't take control easily,
                        do they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Well, complicated on the one hand, but easier than you might expect
                    on the other. As you said, it's like being a mayor. You have maybe 400 housing
                    units, 400-500 American employees and their dependents running everything from
                    movies to church to clubs to tennis courts and so forth. So there's lots of
                    areas that could produce strife, management challenges. And of course there were
                    some. That's why they had a big and senior administrative staff. On the other
                    hand, it worked. It worked well, people were by-and-large happy. The morale in
                    Germany, in my experience, would go up and down in almost direct proportion to
                    the exchange rate. There were times when it wasn't very favorable, and the place
                    is almost under siege. Nobody leaves the compound to go out to dinner or take a
                    trip. It's too expensive! They just sort of sit around the compound. But
                    fortunately we had enough activities there. We had ball games and softball
                    teams, a high school with football teams, a teen club, other things, and an
                    American Club, the Embassy Club, to which Germans were admitted; more than half
                    the membership was German. So there were ways you could survive without having
                    to spend a lot of marks out on the economy. And depending on the exchange rate
                    that's what happened, or a lot of grumbling. When the exchange rate was better
                    and people could go out or take a trip, then morale was better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any problems that come to mind, just to give an idea of
                        what you might have to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: We started some programs, one was started before I got there that was
                    called the Swap Program, where we swapped — remember I told you that the housing
                    compound we owned, we had more housing than we needed. So before I came to Bonn
                    the Embassy had swapped some apartment units to the Germans for houses out on
                    the economy. Some previous... I think it was Henry Cabot Lodge, had called Bonn
                    the golden ghetto, and he wanted some of the diplomatic officers to get out of
                    that compound. So we traded some apartments to the Germans for I think about 10
                    houses. So we had some Political Officers and diplomatic officers out living
                    among the Germans, so to speak. While I was there we sold the Germans two
                    apartment buildings, and we turned over to the Germans the streets. It turns out
                    we had built the streets within the housing compound in '48, five or six
                    streets, regular paved streets, sidewalks, curbs, the whole business, and
                    everything was our property. The streets, the sidewalks, the buildings, the
                    lawns, everything. And I think the Legal Office had previously ruled that
                    diplomatic immunity applied to the whole area, so if you were a diplomat living
                    in an apartment and you walked across the street to another apartment, you're
                    still in diplomatic territory. So we went to the Germans and told them, we'd
                    like to give you the streets — and the streetlights and the sidewalks. It worked
                    because we had good relations with the Germans. They said, we're not going to
                    take streets in bad conditions. No potholes or any of that stuff. So you have to
                    bring them up to good maintenance level, all the light bulbs in the streetlights
                    had to work, and we will accept.... So we actually gave the streetlights to the
                    German government. That pattern by the way is happening again right now.</p>
                <p>That same pattern is happening now since the Berlin Wall has come down and so
                    forth, the German government is moving to Berlin, we're moving to Berlin in the
                    out years, maybe five to ten. We are now, today, engaged in trading the German
                    government apartments in Bonn — we've already signed some agreements — in
                    exchange for some houses in Berlin. So that part works. We also traded some in
                    some of the consulates, in Munich, Stuttgart, and so forth. That was an example
                    of our good relations with the Germans. We could make deals.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, after the wall came down, and Germany was reunited, it announced
                    that it intended to move its capital to Berlin. I was DAS for Inspections in
                    OIG. The DCM from Germany was in town and came by to see Sherman Funk. He said
                    that a decision had been made not to build a chancery in Berlin. Said they
                    didn't have the money. They would use the old East Berlin Embassy for the
                    embassy substantive sections, and put consular, administrative and everyone else
                    in the old army space occupied by the U. S. Mission to West Berlin, a 45 minute
                    drive away.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>After the meeting, I wrote a memorandum for Sherman Funk's signature, to Admiral
                    Fort, who was the Assistant Secretary for Administration, pointing out that for
                    the U. S. to plead poverty as reason not to build a chancery on out property at
                    the Brandenburg gate would be interpreted by the Germans as a lack of respect
                    for their decision to rebuild a united Berlin. Within out embassy, it would
                    drive a wedge between the two halves of the Foreign Service (something I had
                    fought all my career) by housing them in buildings 45 minutes apart, be
                    dysfunctional by requiring 1 and 1/2 hours travel every day, for those who
                    travel from one building to the other for meetings or other purposes. Somewhat
                    to my surprise, the Inspector General signed this memorandum, and off it went
                    with copies to others. This memorandum caused a re-evaluation within the
                    department, and the decision was made to build a new chancery on our property at
                    the Brandenburg gate, as Britian would also do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounded like a very long, drawn-out process getting out
                        of the...when we first arrived in '45, and the war and the immediate
                        post-war years we had to go in and almost build everything and then it was a
                        slow disassembling of this machine which, as you say, is still going on
                        today, almost 50 years later. Did you have a problem with the pecking order,
                        who got what apartment? Did this end up in your lap?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes it did, and no it wasn't a problem, basically. Amazingly few
                    problems of that nature got to my level. There undoubtedly were a lot of back
                    and forth and so forth at lower levels, at mid-grade or among secretaries or
                    clerks or junior officers, I assume there were. But during my years no more than
                    two or three cases reached my level. The reason for that I think is that aside
                    from the houses, the people who built that compound did it right. I have nothing
                    but praise for them. All the apartments were coded as to kind, they had
                    secretarial apartments, executive secretarial apartments, mid-grade officer
                    apartments, senior officer apartments, and so forth. They were all coded; we had
                    six or seven categories in terms of square footage and degree of appointments
                    within the apartment, the quality of the furnishings. We had them all coded and
                    people were assigned to them according to where they fit in the pecking order,
                    their rank, size of family, and so forth. And by and large it worked, there were
                    no great grievances that reached me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find...was there a problem in sort of dealing
                        with the consulates? We had quite a few consulates given the size of the
                        country, there was Berlin, which was a special case, and there was Hamburg
                        and Frankfurt, and I guess Stuttgart and Munich at that time, and I guess
                        Dusseldorf.</hi>

                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes, there were some problems that required my travel. I went down to
                    Munich to deal with some furniture and property issues. In Hamburg we were going
                    to build a new Consul General's residence, didn't work out. But yes, support of
                    the consulates and relations with the consulates was a fairly big part of my
                    job. I dealt with all the entire management, administration, budget support
                    area, the DCM dealt with the principal officers on their substantive issues, the
                    Consul General dealt with them on consular issues. So the three of us each had
                    our little niche in terms of dealing with the consulates. And basically it
                    worked. Relations were good. We had principal officer conferences once or twice
                    a year, get together, talk things over. They would drive up occasionally for
                    consultations. In some cases where they were close like Dusseldorf and
                    Frankfurt, which were only a one or two hour drive away, the ambassador and DCM
                    used to regularly invite them to diplomatic functions at the Embassy, and when
                    it was worthwhile, they would travel that distance to attend diplomatic
                    functions in Bonn.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling about the Soviet threat? Again, we're
                        trying to recreate the time. One of the things I assume that would have been
                        on your plate would have been the E&amp;E Plan, emergency evacuation, which
                        was really...what were the Soviets going to...how did we feel about the
                        Soviet threat at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Well obviously it was a big part of our...it was the umbrella under
                    which we all lived, the threat umbrella, the stress umbrella. And dealing with
                    Berlin brought it to the fore practically every day. We had a...not only did we
                    have the Mission in Berlin but we had within Embassy Bonn we had an officer who
                    was full-time Berlin liaison officer, Berlin issues officer, and the Russians or
                    the East Germans or somebody was always causing us a little grief, holding
                    things up at the border, doing something in Berlin, or a G.I. would go AWOL and
                    cross the border. So there were constant incidents with the Russians or the East
                    Germans that the Embassy had to deal with. It was kind of an irritant that
                    constantly reminded you that there is a Cold War, probably more so than in other
                    countries. And also I think it is generally known that the Americans always
                    considered the Soviet threat more of a threat than anybody else. More than the
                    Germans, the Italians, the French, the Spanish, even the British to some degree,
                    with their Socialist governments or social democratic governments, they weren't
                    that excited about the dangers of Communism. Now, Soviet military threat, yes,
                    but the Communist threat, which in some ways we also hyped in the United States,
                    although those were really two different things, the Soviet military threat and
                    the threat of international communism. The Europeans just didn't get excited
                    about those things, at least not to the degree we did. Nevertheless the British
                    particularly could be tough on Berlin. And we had a group in Bonn, I think it
                    was called the Bonn Group. It was the DCMs, the American, British, French DCMs
                    that met regularly, sometimes even weekly throughout the year to deal with
                    Berlin issues. How to answer this diplomatic note, how to deal with that issue,
                    what kind of protest we should lodge, and so forth. Also the presence of 250,000
                    or so troops in Germany was an overwhelming aspect of our total environment.
                    Their maneuvers, their training exercises, their GIs who went AWOL or committed
                    crimes, got in the newspaper, often spilled over into the diplomatic arena. So
                    in Embassy Bonn we had a USAREUR liaison officer and an Air Force liaison
                    officer, they were at colonel levels, and of course we in turn had POLADs at
                    their commands. Political advisers, diplomatic officers assigned to Stuttgart
                    and Heidelberg that tried to keep the information flowing both ways so that we
                    could coordinate and deal with these issues smoothly. More or less it
                    worked.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the spy problem? One always thinks of Germany as
                        being permeated...this is one of the biggest industries next to Volkswagen
                        is being a spy. How did you deal with the spy business?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Well we were obviously alert to it. We had an intelligence capacity
                    in Bonn and a counterintelligence capacity in Bonn. Most of the espionage that
                    was occurring at that time, and certainly that made it to the press and came
                    into the public domain seemed to be directed a) either at the NATO context, and
                    the spies were in Brussels and often maybe through a non-American in Brussels or
                    against the Germans. You know, Willy Brandt left office because of that. We used
                    to say “A German is a German. You can't tell an East German from a West German.”
                    They don't wear labels on their chest. They're Germans, and some of them were
                    East Germans masquerading as West Germans and they were able to penetrate the
                    West German government periodically.First of all the Germans who worked in the
                    United States Embassy didn't have access to classified material. And while we
                    were alert to such matters, I'm not aware of any espionage incident involving
                    the U.S. Embassy.</p>

                    Secretary Kissinger 13 times, but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he difficult to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yeah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How? In what way?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Well one of the things that complicated life considerably, in more
                    than one way, was that he became Secretary of State from the National Security
                    Council, and he kept both hats. As Chairman of the National Security Council, he
                    had a right to Secret Service Protection. The Secretary of State has always been
                    protected by State Department security people. And when he travels State
                    Department security people...and we're plugged in to those people, we're on the
                    same frequency, our walkie-talkies are on the same frequency. Kissinger would
                    come with Secret Service, all these aliens, they don't know anything about State
                    Department, about Embassies, they've been to the Embassies, but they don't know
                    our Regional Security Officers, they don't know the hierarchy — the Regional
                    Security Officer reports to the Admin Officer — the way our own people do. And
                    we didn't fully trust them either, I mean in terms of information. If I were
                    talking to a Regional Security Officer who was protecting the Secretary of
                    State, I would tell him anything, about the Embassy, about the Ambassador— but
                    when I'm talking to a Secret Service officer, he's outside of my...and they have
                    their own channels, they talk on radio back to the White House — and that's
                    another issue, they're talking back to the White House, not to the State
                    Department. And this caused some stress in terms of the arrangements. And most
                    of these arrangements are actually dictated by security people. The advance
                    people are security people — who goes in what car, who goes to what meeting and
                    so forth — the security people are in that up to their neck. And here they're
                    from another agency! That caused considerable strains on communication. They can
                    talk to the White House and I can't, and I can't talk to them very easy either,
                    the way I could to a State Department security officer, because he probably has
                    a walkie-talkie that I gave him! They've brought their own, with their own
                    frequencies.</p>
                <p>And the second thing was that Kissinger was quite imperial. So those two
                    things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give any feel for...I mean, you say “imperial.”
                        What...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes. He liked — I suppose all Secretaries do — he liked to be
                    attended to, waited on. Everything ready. He expected an officer to be holding
                    his overcoat when he got ready to go outside. Which is okay. Matter of fact I
                    held his coat once. What we found annoying was that he wanted all this service,
                    which is okay, but he didn't want people around. So the order I got, because I
                    had around 15 people supporting his visit, the order I got was “keep your people
                    out of sight, out of the way, keep them behind the scenes. Kissinger doesn't
                    like to see all these minions standing around.” Well, I can understand that too.
                    But you take that to such an extreme that you've got to hold his coat but you've
                    got to be out of sight. How do you do that? He was tough. Kissinger was a tough
                    guy. But that's okay, he was a tough policy guy too. As I told you earlier about
                    Hillenbrand. Effective, but I was just giving you a little sense of style
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the fall of Vietnam have any particular impact... I
                        mean here we were holding the line in Germany and all, and we tried to hold
                        the line in Vietnam and it didn't work out. And in the spring of '75 we
                        pulled out in great disarray from Vietnam. Did you feel that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yeah. A couple of things. It improved our relationship with several
                    European countries, including the Swedes and some others that had not supported
                    our efforts in Vietnam. They didn't see the threat in the same way we did. It
                    also lessened, diminished considerably all the demonstrations we used to get,
                    graffiti on Embassy walls and rallies against Vietnam. That all went away. So I
                    think that at least in some superficial way, I don't know how deep it went, the
                    pulling out of U.S. troops and disengagement in Vietnam contributed to better
                    relationships with Europeans. It removed a little thorn that was in the side
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well speaking of pulling out, just about that time you
                        pulled out. What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I was assigned to be Admin Counselor in Spain from Bonn in 1975.
                    Similar circumstances — Wells Stabler was coming out as a new Ambassador. I
                    think the tour of the previous adminstrative officer may not have been up, but I
                    remember that Stabler wanted a new Admin Counselor and he wanted what he
                    considered to be a first class, competent, active, can-doer, and it was worked
                    out that I was the guy. I had been in Bonn three years, and Stabler, unlike
                    Hillenbrand, was tough. One might say difficult, but certainly hard, and that
                    made itself felt right from the beginning. I was due home leave, and I've got a
                    wife and kids. So I was going to leave in June when my time was up, go on home
                    leave, and report to Madrid in August. He said “No.” So I said “Well I haven't
                    had home leave.” He said “Nothing goes on here in August. I don't need you here
                    in August, the whole country goes off to the countryside on vacation. I want you
                    to come in June and then you can go on home leave in August.” So I said, well
                    how do I do this? I've got to arrange it as kind of a direct transfer, deferred
                    home leave. I'll raise it with Washington. They approved it. So I went direct,
                    left my family behind, direct to Madrid in June and worked in Madrid in June and
                    July, went on home leave with my family in August, and came back in September.
                    And when I got there in June he told me “This is a sleepy little Mediterranean
                    post that we're bringing into the 20th century. We're going to make it a first
                    class Embassy, you and me. So pull up your bootstraps and get at it!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation like...you were in Spain
                        from '75 to '79. Let's start when you arrived. What was the political
                        situation like at that time, as we saw it?”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Franco was dictator. He had been dictator ever since the civil war.
                    He ran the country with an iron grip, with the Guardia Civil. He controlled the
                    press. There was elements of a rough Parliament, which he controlled. Basically
                    a police state. He was getting on in years, was in ill health. Was expected to
                    die several times even before I came. Somebody told me, “You may be in Spain
                    when Franco dies. Two successive tours of officers have thought they were going
                    to be in Spain when Franco dies.” He outlived their tours. So when Franco was
                    going to die and who was going to succeed him was a big part of the reporting.
                    And how its going to...is there going to be another civil war? Will there be
                    strife? Transition to democracy, is it going to be another military takeover,
                    some other general going to step into his boots? So keeping up with that was a
                    full-time occupation.</p>
                <p>Because of this sleepy little Mediterranean post thing, because it was a military
                    dictatorship, the role of our military attach�s was very important because the
                    press were controlled and the Parliament was limited the role of our
                    intelligence agencies was important. So it was basically a military/intelligence
                    post. Our political officers were a little bit in the backwash. No democracy, no
                    press, no parliamentarians to go talk to. The people who know something are the
                    generals, so we send our colonel over to deal with that. Economic affairs was
                    low-key. Of course if Franco died and it became a democracy or a democratic
                    monarchy, that changes things. That's what Stabler anticipated and he was 100%
                    right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, you're the Administrative Counselor and you're going
                        to turn this sleepy Mediterranean post into a 20th century dynamo. From your
                        perspective and the Ambassador's perspective, what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I worked on infrastructure and some basic services. Get the telephone
                    answered when it rings. We'd got a 19th century switchboard with inadequate
                    lines, the old pull-cord type. So one of my programs was to get a new, modern
                    switchboard so that we don't need three operators to pull cords when one or two
                    could do it pushing a few buttons. And maybe the phone gets answered. Beefing up
                    the duty officer situation so we're in operation 24 hours a day seven days a
                    week. First class! None of this business that we can't find a duty officer,
                    school will keep til Monday. Office space arrangements. Getting the telegrams
                    distributed earlier within the Mission and getting enough copies. Which was the
                    same story, they had old copying machines that were slow and didn't make enough
                    copies and you couldn't make copies in color and this and that. So I revamped
                    all that to get better communications going. Things along that line.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>What dominated the staff meetings at that time was Franco's death. Franco was
                    going to die practically every day. It used to take up all the time of all the
                    staff meetings, and we would get urinalysis reports from the military attach�
                    who got them from the Army doctor. His urinalysis shows that he's got bile in
                    his liver or whatever and he's going to die within 24 hours. The station chief
                    sent out a critic message that Franco had died. Ambassador Stabler called me at
                    home about 10 o' clock at night, demanding to know how he could send out a
                    telegram when he chose, but the Ambassador had to give two hours notice to do
                    so. Apparently the station chief had given him that excuse for sending out a
                    critic message instead of reporting to the ambassador to do so. I explained that
                    he had a communicator standing by at the embassy, in case he were needed, but we
                    had to call one in for duty when required, because we did not have the overtime
                    money to keep one on duty routinely, and he did. Stabler said this was
                    unacceptable. I suggested he tell the station chief not to send cables without
                    his permission instead of chastising me about the communications structure; he
                    said “you let me worry about that.” Well it turned out that franco had not died,
                    they put him on a dialysis machine. They had to send a cancellation to the
                    critic message.</p>
                <p>But one day he did die. It was about the first year of my time there, it must
                    have been '76. And Stabler was kind of doing the same thing I was. He was
                    getting a first class team. He got Frank McNeil as Political Counselor, which
                    was an excellent choice. So he was on hand and in place when Franco died. When
                    the Spanish wanted to talk about a new constitution or parliamentary democracy
                    we had Frank McNeil there who could...we might have brought experts from the
                    States, probably did, but Frank had a lot of this stuff right in his head. And
                    he did a lot of groundwork with the foreign affairs people and with
                    parliamentarians and so forth. And Stabler had excellent contacts, right from
                    the King on down to discuss all of these issues. So I think the U.S. was able to
                    play a facilitating role and offer some good counsel in the transition from
                    dictatorship to democracy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our concerns with Franco gone? What were the
                        issues and the problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Well one real problem, which actually occurred later, was the threat
                    of a military coup. Not exactly a coup, but that some other military general
                    would step in and say “I'm going to succeed Franco.” Of course our goal was to
                    move Spain, or to see Spain move to a parliamentary democracy. And as you may
                    recall, the sword was passed to King Juan Carlos as the sovereign, with a
                    parliamentary democracy, with a prime minister, and there was actually on the
                    floor of Parliament, and a colonel with a machine gun and they were going to
                    close down Parliament and take over the government. And King Juan Carlos was
                    able to cut that off with his charisma and leadership. So that was the real
                    threat we were all worried about.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>The second thing was to make it governable. You don't need a lot of fragmented
                    parties like you had in Italy, where nobody had a majority, nobody could rule.
                    There was also concerns about retribution, the same thing we're concerned about
                    now in Haiti. When you change from a Franco government to a non-Franco
                    government there's a lot of people who have grievances going back to the civil
                    war. Are some of those people going to come out on the streets? Is there going
                    to be a new civil war? Are there going to be killings in retribution for what
                    happened in '36? Or even '56? Mostly that didn't happen. Mostly it worked. There
                    were some strikes of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our estimate before Franco's death...I mean
                        obviously you're sitting in on country team meetings and all, what were you
                        getting the impression of Juan Carlos...he became King, later he gained in
                        stature, but before something happened what was sort of the feeling about
                        him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Favorable, but with some kind of lingering doubts because he had kept
                    a low profile. He hadn't really stepped forward and said “This is who I am, this
                    is what I stand for and this is where I'm going to take Spain.” I think he felt
                    he couldn't do that with Franco alive, so he stayed in the shadows and nobody
                    knew for sure what kind of sovereign he was going to be. So there were some
                    doubts, some 'let's watch carefully,' but with an overlay of optimism. He seems
                    to be the right guy, he seems to want to go where we want to go. So, general
                    favorable impression but some doubts because that impresison wasn't based on
                    in-depth knowledge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, on a more practical level, here you were, you were
                        going to turn it into the 20th century. You've just some from Germany, where
                        you have an extremely competent — maybe overcompetent — foreign service
                        national staff, how did you find the Spanish employees of our Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Very good. Very competent, none of this “siesta” kind of stuff that
                    you might visualize. Basically we cranked up the tempo, and some people told me
                    to my face, Clint, you guys ruined that post. Spain used to be a “good” post,
                    why you could go out there for two or three years and play golf out at the
                    airbase on Friday afternoon and have weekends to yourself to travel, and you
                    guys are out there were working the ass off of people. Coming in on Saturday and
                    you don't have time for golf! Well, that's exactly what happened. Two of my
                    staff members were out playing golf on Friday afternoon when I arrived. I
                    stopped it. I said “no golf on duty hours.” I was a real you guess what, I was a
                    real son of a bitch. So we cranked up the tempo. We had more work and we mostly
                    did it with the same number of people. There were some shifts in staffing, I
                    think we got another economic officer, we got a political officer, and we
                    probably cut an intelligence agent and a military attach� to make up for it. But
                    the volume of production and work probably doubled. So it was a spinning
                    operation when I left.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the death of Franco was there a change in the nature of
                        our representation? Did you see a real change in how one dealt with the
                        Spanish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Ambassador Stabler, yes. And it caused some stress within the
                    Mission. Our three colonel-level officers, Army, Air Force, Navy, they were used
                    to dealing with the Spanish officials on a lot of business. They were used to
                    seeing the Minister of Defense, and Stabler reined them in. He said, “I'm the
                    Ambassador here and I will deal with Cabinet officers. You will not. No member
                    of this staff will call on a Cabinet officer without my approval and advance
                    knowledge. And I may want to go and interview them myself. And I may want to
                    take you with me and I may not.” The response was “You can't do that. Why can't
                    we go and see the Secretary of Defense? Why we're old drinking buddies!” And he
                    said “I don't care. You're not going.” He moved it out of the
                    military-intelligence arena into the diplomatic arena. And more work shifted
                    from the military officers, who used to get the information from the military,
                    to the diplomatic officers who were now getting it from the Foreign Office,
                    parliamentarians, from the Prime Minister's office, and so forth. So it changed
                    the emphasis of our reporting, it changed the source of our information as this
                    occurred.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to emphasize what you're saying is that one of the
                        problems we have with governments that are basically totalitarian is that
                        the relationship between intelligence officers and military officers and
                        their counterparts gets to be a little too chummy, a little too cozy. We're
                        too comfortable with the situation and we become part of the problem instead
                        of trying to further what are essentially American interests, which is the
                        free, open give-and-take rather than the closed little circle. Is that your
                        feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I think that's right and I think Spain was an example of it. What we
                    were doing in Spain was cozying up to the military, who were in power there —
                    when I say we, I'm, talking about the military officers in the Embassy — and
                    their relationships were kind of military-to-military and they got invited over
                    to military clubs for a drink and they had the colonels and generals out to
                    their house for a drink and the whole thing was really very cozy. And they
                    cooperated and exchanged information, without the equivalent occurring in the
                    diplomatic arena.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at this, I was in Athens between '70 and '74,
                        where that kind of thing was happening too. And it blew up in our face. Was
                        the example of being too close to the colonels in Wells Stabler's mind at
                        all, because he was coming out of EUR at the time. I mean, did you get any
                        feeling that he was looking at this as being sort of a bad example, because
                        the repercussions were just being felt when he arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I think what you and I said about what happens in military
                    dictatorships, I'm sure Stabler knew that and felt that, but I don't think that
                    was his primary motive. I think his primary motive was to take control, to
                    manage the relationship with Spain himself, and to do it with diplomatic
                    officers like Frank McNeil who know about diplomacy and constitutional law and
                    democracy and so forth. That was the keel upon which he wanted to base our
                    relationships with Spain, and to do that, he's got to put the military down, put
                    them in place. He can't have them going off independently, doing their own
                    thing, and saying God knows what outside his control. So he brought them in
                    control and he shifted the emphasis to Frank McNeil and his staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well one of the problems I would think would be that no
                        matter how you slice it, the air bases there and Rota, the submarine naval
                        base, can get to be a controlling element as the Azores were...everything we
                        did with Portugal was based on the base in the Azores. Did you all feel the
                        heavy weight of trying to keep those bases going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes, yes, and it was a source of stress. The presence of Torrejon
                    particularly, that's the big air base next to Madrid. The naval base, the
                    submarine base at Rota, was from a strategic standpoint probably more important
                    to us, but it was off to one side and it wasn't an embarrassment to the Spanish
                    the way this big airbase right outside the capital, with all these Americans out
                    there and these fighter planes coming in and taking off, and the GIs from the
                    base smoking pot or getting arrested — all these were potential political
                    problems for the Spanish. So we had to walk softly on that. Also, Spain was very
                    conscious of their sovereignty, they were very afraid and very tough on the
                    issue of our using Torrejon as a launching base for non-Spanish operations, in
                    the Middle East or somewhere else. So even if we're headed off to bomb Qadhafi
                    or something, we're not going to land at the Spanish airbase and refuel or
                    something else without their permission, and mostly they didn't want us to do
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This came up in '73, particularly during the '73 war
                        between Israel and Syria and Egypt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: It came up many times when I was there, including some cases
                    involving Qadhafi, when we wanted to send planes over to make a point or
                    whatever and for convenience or geography or whatever they wanted to refuel at
                    Torrejon, and they said “No, we don't want you to.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we've mentioned all of them, but what would you
                        call your main problems while you were there. Anything that we haven't
                        talked about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: No. I can summarize... Our major problems were infrastructure, the
                    telephone system, office space — we built an annex on the chancery — we expected
                    with the democratization process that the cost of operations, the travel would
                    increase, the visa workload would increase. We had to prepare for that. You
                    don't wait until they're standing in the waiting room. So we remodeled the
                    consular section. Simultaneously we were doing things on security. So we
                    remodeled and enlarged the consular section, we put in bulletproof interview
                    windows for security reasons. We built an extra wing so some of the operations
                    could be consolidated — Administration, GSO. We got better communications
                    equipment, we improved the security of the vault, the communications vault so
                    that we could operate really 24 hours a day, seven days a week on alert basis.
                    And ginning up the tempo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the...was there a chage in dealing with
                        the Spanish government with the demise of Franco, from your point of
                        view.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes, after Franco died obviously our way of doing business and all
                    our contacts and relationships changed markedly. There was a period of a few
                    months when there was some stress, dealing with the palace where Franco had
                    lived and dealing with Mrs. Franco's aspirations and demands. But by and large
                    the Embassy disengaged from dealing with the Franco aides and Franco household
                    and so forth. There was an election, an elected prime minister. So you now had a
                    constitutional monarch, an elected prime minister, you had the Cortes, a
                    parliament, so our business was with the prime minister, the prime minister's
                    cabinet and his aides and members of the Cortes whom we wanted to influence and
                    also learn their views. And of course the Ambassador met periodically with the
                    King. The Secretary of State came, I think still Kissinger at that time, and
                    called on King Juan Carlos, and they made some arrangement whereby the Secretary
                    of State would visit Spain once a year. That still happens to my knowledge, it
                    may change because of the NATO relationship. Spain was not in NATO. The U.S. met
                    with NATO officials, the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense met with
                    NATO every year and here's Spain out in the cold. So, the Secretary of State
                    will come to Spain every year. So it did change quite a bit, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find when you arrived that the social life and all
                        was around sort of what passed for the nobility? Was it captured by “high

                <p>LAUDERDALE: And they like the Americans...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They like diplomats dangling around and all...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: That's it, you've got it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is one of the curses of our business, and how you
                        disengage from that. Did Terence Todman come while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes he did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now he's another old hand, but coming from quite a
                        different area. How did he use you, and what was your impression of how he
                        operated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: He came...he had been Ambassador twice, but just as important he had
                    been Assistant Secretary for Latin American Affairs. When he first arrived we
                    found his style a little bit imperial. More demanding of support and services
                    than a small Embassy can provide. The Bureau could provide, in terms of press
                    briefings, translations of major press articles by 8:00 every morning. It was a
                    fairly big strain. He was also very much of a written person, as opposed to
                    Stabler who was oral. You could tell Stabler almost anything orally. Todman
                    wanted things in writing more often, and as you know writing takes more time,
                    etc. etc. So, on the other hand, he wasn't the hard driver that Stabler was.
                    Stabler was kind of a hard driver, demanding on the staff in terms of output.
                    Todman was softer, one might say, he wasn't as demanding in that way which
                    offered a little respite, on the other hand he tended to demand...his immediate
                    office required more support. But I must say he was very effective in dealing
                    with the Spanish and I thought he had the right attitude. On some occasions in
                    staff meetings and such where I saw him correct officers, I thought he was
                    absolutely right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give a feel for what his thrust was where maybe
                        the officers might be disagreeing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: We had some dispute with the Spanish about the use of Torrejon Air
                    Base, and we had an officer who almost every day, full time, would call the
                    Spanish every day based on cables coming in from the military wanting 3 F-15s to
                    land tomorrow or two C-30s, and the Spanish required that we get approval for
                    every one. That were outside of the planes that were stationed there. These were
                    planes that would stop and do something and go on. I think our officer tended to
                    talk tough to the Spanish on these issues, because sometimes they might say no
                    or whatever, and he felt he had to push and demand and so forth. And I remember
                    on that issue and another issue Todman asked: “Aren't we supposed to have
                    friendly relations with the Spanish? Why don't we tell them that's what we're
                    here for? We want friendly relations. We want to treat them fairly and we want
                    to be treated fairly, and here's our need and can you help us. Let's watch out
                    for the desk-pounding and strong language, because I don't think that's how you
                    promote friendly relations. I don't think that's even going to get you a
                    positive response!” And it seemed to work. We didn't always get our way,
                    but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, you left there in 1979. What was your feeling about
                        whither Spain and all, at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I was very hopeful. My concern was primarily about the economic side
                    of Spain. Two or three things happened when King Juan Carlos came into power and
                    democracy, along with that came a lot of abuse, a lot of pent-up resentment that
                    produced abuse. The press wasn't a self-disciplined press. Suddenly you could
                    buy Playboy magazine which had been banned for 30 years, so guess what, the
                    newsstands were just filled with girly magazines, just to excess. Boys and girls
                    who weren't allowed to kiss and hold hands on the park benches for 30 years now
                    would kiss and hold hands not only on the park bench but in restaurants and just
                    about everywhere else! Crime went up. There was no crime before, at least you
                    didn't know of any because it wasn't reported in the press. And the Guardia
                    Civil ran a tight ship. Now there was rampant crime, pickpockets all over the
                    place. There was a demonstration...I had a good relationship with the chief of
                    police, who was an army colonel, until they got democracy. There was a
                    demonstration while I was there and the police beat up a number of
                    demonstrators, which caused quite a flurry. I had lunch with the chief of police
                    and he told me “You know, I have a hell of a time re-directing the police.
                    They've been used to beating people with a club for 30 years when they don't get
                    out of the way or do what they're told. And I'm trying to tell them this is
                    democracy now, and we don't hit people over the head, you can steer these crowds
                    down dead-end streets or cul-de-sacs to get them out of the way. There are other
                    techniques we can use to defuse these crowds without hurting a lot of people.”
                    So I was confident that some of these things would peter out, and it did, and it
                    all worked.</p>
                <p>The economic side — unemployment was high, the economy was kind of stagnant, and
                    that took a little time. It's still true today, by the way, even through they
                    joined the Common Market and the economy is up, unemployment is higher in Spain
                    today than most other countries. So they still have an economic struggle.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you left in '79, you came back for a relatively
                        short time to Washington, didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I came back for five years, but I was in my first job only for a
                    year. I was director of recruitment and employment for the State Department from
                    1979-80.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does that job entail?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: It has three divisions: recruitment, examination, and employment. The
                    examination side is exclusively foreign service. You know for civil service
                    employees the civil service, OPM, administers tests and determines eligibility
                    for competitive ranking, to get hired. But for foreign service, the State
                    Department does all of that itself. So it's running the foreign service officer
                    examination, the written and oral examinations, all of the other things,
                    producing the register of eligibles, hiring new FSOs and Foreign Service
                    secretaries and communicators into classes. That's the recruitment and
                    examination part. Employment is basically getting people on board, on duty. So I
                    was in...I'll tell you I had a real trauma. I still remember the day I reported
                    for duty, on August 20, 1979, and there was a memo scotch-taped to my desk and
                    it said: “You have an appointment with the Secretary of State in 10 days.” it
                    gave a date and time and said -”Be there!”</p>
                <p>He was very unhappy about...This was Secretary Cyrus Vance. and Ben Reed was
                    Under Secretary for Management and Harry Barnes was Director General. Ben Reed
                    and Secretary Vance were very, very unhappy about minority recruitment and women
                    into the Foreign Service. They had set goals—they called them goals, not
                    quotas—those goals had not been met. They were annoyed. And I guess somebody
                    said we've got a new director coming and I guess the Secretary said: “I want to
                    see him.” So I went to a meeting with those four with some others about ten days
                    after I...and we all got chewed out was basically what it was. We were
                    admonished and reprimanded for not doing better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you knew this shoe was going to drop. You arrived
                        and you knew this was going to be the issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I didn't know that it would dominate my job the way it did.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well just to get the atmosphere — you've just arrived,
                        you're the new boy, you know you're going to see the Secretary of State, you
                        know that goals have been set and all this. So you assemble your staff, what
                        were they telling you was the problem? What were you getting about the
                        system before you had any control over it about what the problem was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I'll use the word infrastructure again, it's probably not the best
                    word, but the infrastructure, the bureaucracy, was not designed to bring in
                    large numbers of women and minorities on a short-term basis, so it didn't work.
                    The other thing is that the very nature of the Foreign Service is not conducive
                    to bringing in mid-level people. They had two programs, a junior officer program
                    and a mid-level program, and the Foreign Service is not conducive to bringing in
                    mid-level people. So in thumbnail those were the two major barriers. And my
                    ability to do anything about it is very limited.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've had dealings with...I was with the Board of Examiners
                        at one point, around '75-'76, and the thing with bringing mid-level people
                        in, they're a different kind of cat, coming from outside the Foreign
                        Service. I'm told that even today it doesn't work because they come in and
                        they don't understand and they're not very good!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I was in that job for one year and I'll tell you, I compromised most
                    of my principles. I came from a personnel background, I was a personnel officer
                    for three years before I came into the Foreign Service. Not only was I a
                    personnel officer, I was a merit systems officer. I helped create and establish
                    and operate merit systems. And most of the principles that I learned and
                    believed in I had to compromise when I was in this job. And as you say, we
                    brought in the mid-level — before I came Secretary Vance had set a goal of 20
                    mid-levels for five years, to bring in 100 officers. By the time it was all
                    over, we did it in six or seven years, we brought in 120 officers. Most of them
                    are not in the Foreign Service today. They didn't survive, they didn't prosper.
                    We've got a few, but there was a lot of slippage and wastage in the process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I was with the Board of Examiners were mainly civil
                        servants who were working on the EEO side of things who would read the
                        notice first and apply, and they really weren't of the same caliber at all
                        as people who had come through the Foreign Service. We're talking about
                        competitiveness, not just being our type, but they just couldn't write very
                        well and weren't very responsive to foreign affairs problems. But that was
                        my impression, what was yours?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: That's basically right. Let's talk first a bit about structure. One
                    of the structural problems you know is about the merit system. What is a merit
                    system? The civil service system is a merit system, you have to compete for
                    appointment, you have to be examined in some form or other, you have to be
                    ranked among the best qualified. If you do all of that you can be selected by a
                    selecting official and you can be hired. Having gone through that process you
                    are then assured certain protections. You are protected for being fired for
                    political reasons, you were hired on the basis of merit and you were given
                    tenure. Now Foreign Service is a merit system too, the law says it is a merit
                    system, not the same as the civil service, but a merit system. And we have some
                    parallel systems to meet the same principles. We have an FSO written
                    examination, an oral examination, an evaluation of training and experience and
                    health and security and conduct and behavior and we rank order people and hire
                    them off registers into the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>The minorities and women that we're talking about don't go through that process.
                    Well how are they going to meet the merit test? You can't just hire them, that's
                    illegal. Well, there was a pre-existing structure that they grabbed onto.
                    There's a provision in the Foreign Service Act that says if you have three years
                    of civil service experience, that is to say, if you've got tenure, because the
                    civil service has a three-year career conditional element, you're tenured into
                    the government merit system and therefore you can be tenured into the Foreign
                    Service. So to qualify to become an FSO you had to have three years of
                    government experience. Now a lot of these candidates didn't have three years of
                    government experience. We were appointing people in those days in State,
                    domestic and overseas, in Foreign Service reserve appointments. We would hire
                    people from outside the government, as FSR appointees, Foreign Service reserve
                    appointees, where they would have to serve for three years. Then they could be
                    converted to Foreign Service Officers. To do that they had to take a lateral
                    entry examination. There was a good reason for that structure. That structure
                    pre-existed, it was not set up for minorities and women, it was set up to help
                    the Foreign Service meet its needs and still comply with the merit system. So
                    they used that structure for the minorities and womens' programs at the
                    mid-level, not for junior officers. So they had to be recruited and selected
                    initially, and they were given an oral examination,, to be hired, and then three
                    years later they had to go through another examination to become an FSO. A lot
                    of them didn't make it. The system wasn't working. And it came to be that the
                    FSO oral and remaining lateral entry examination was called the second oral. So
                    then some people who thought progress wasn't enough wanted to know why did we
                    have a second oral? Well it wasn't really a second oral, it was the Foreign
                    Service examination! The first oral was just an employment interview. So using
                    that structure was one of the first problems.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>Another one was that if you want to recruit minorities and women, particularly
                    into an elitist organization, like the Foreign Service where you have highly
                    educated, highly motivated, highly competitive people, you can't just throw
                    people into that career at mid-level. If you want to recruit minorities and
                    women you have to head hunt. You have to do it on an individual level, you can't
                    throw nets out like you're fishing for tuna and see what comes in! And that's
                    what they were doing. Head hunting was not authorized. Head hunting was
                    taboo!</p>

                        may not be fair, but this is not the place where somebody who is a real

                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: And then the third structural barrier was, well, you came in the
                    Foreign Service Officer system and I did, and it's a two-year process! So for
                    the junior officer program streamlined a little bit you might be able to do it
                    in a year. And for the mid-level, if it's streamlined, you might be able to do
                    it in a year. They wanted it done next month! They called me on August 21st or
                    whatever it was, talking about the September class! We had an FSO class every
                    two months. “There are no minorities in the September FSO class, so Lauderdale,
                    go get some.” Wait a minute, this is a two-year process and you want me to get
                    some for next month?? So that was my problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself in a position of wanting to say, Oh
                        for God's sakes, just go stuff...”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: No, although I did have to face some issues later, and I did some
                    things I'm ashamed of, probably ought to have gotten fired for. In the middle of
                    September I got a phone call that said “Ben Reed said to cancel the September
                    FSO class”, after I said I'll look into it and I gave them a report that said I
                    couldn't get any minorities, it's too short, it's impossible. I got word back to
                    cancel the FSO class. So I went to my staff and I found out that they had sent
                    cables to some 35 people that said “give notice to your employer, quit your job,
                    kiss your wife, sell your house, report to Washington.” And I'm going to cancel
                    it? I said “No I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to create those inequities
                    and hardships and maybe get lawsuits against the State Department.” And even if
                    they don't sue, the amount of ill will is just endless, and it will haunt you
                    for years!</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>So I said I'm not going to do it. So the first thing I did was nothing. I didn't
                    pull the plug, I didn't give any orders, I didn't pass along the order. It was
                    only about two weeks hence anyway. I waited about two weeks and sent a message
                    saying “I'm sorry, it's too late. My staff tells me that you can't do that. Some
                    people are en route, checking into hotels here in Washington.” I got by with it!
                    I was sweating blood! I was never prepared to be insubordinate to an Under
                    Secretary for Management, but that was an example of things that I did that I'm
                    not proud of, but...</p>
                <p>Now you asked a question about... Here's what happened. We had standards and we
                    had cutoffs so that enough candidates were not getting through the screen. The
                    problem was the quality of the candidates. But there were pressures to lower the
                    screen. And we lowered the cutoff score... I've forgotten the numbers now but
                    just to illustrate, we were using a cutoff score of 70, and if we reduced the
                    cutoff score to 65, I can pick up another 30 candidates to come into processing.
                    And we did that. The decision was made to do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this only for minorities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes, women were only eligible for the mid-level. If we lowered the
                    score to 62, we could get so many more. But I looked at the quality of those
                    candidates and I didn't know what to do. I was troubled. We needed the
                    candidates, we needed a bigger pool. So I conferred with Bob Gershenson, who was
                    the Deputy Assistant Secretary, and Harry Barnes, the Director General, and I
                    told them the problem. That to have a pool big enough, we need to reduce the
                    score to 62, but from 65 to 62, that group, which are another 20 people or so,
                    are marginal. Some of them may make it, many of them won't, and I'm troubled
                    about admitting them and I seek your advice. They both said no, don't do it. So
                    I didn't. So we didn't take numbers where we thought the failure rate would be
                    50% or so, but we did go down to 65, where we thought the failure rate would be
                    30%. So basically what I did to keep the system going was I just worked harder.
                    I worked harder, I worked faster, I intervened personally, I called candidates
                    on the phone. We got the security clearance of a Hispanic candidate from San
                    Antonio on a Friday, that we had been pushing for all week. An FSO class was
                    starting on Monday, and I called that candidate on the phone and asked him if he
                    could be in Washington on Monday. If you can, I'm offering you a job and asking
                    you to come. And he said, “Well, gee, I have to give my employer notice.” So I
                    said, “Well, just walk out. Leave him a note, call him on Monday.” He said “I'm
                    going to be treating a lot of people shabbily here,” and I said “Just do it, do
                    it and come. I'll give you a letter later if you want.” But we did that. Just
                    crummy behavior. He came, by the way, and joined the class. But I felt awful
                    about that kind of stuff.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel there was a problem, something within the
                        infrastructure that was not reaching out to the right people to get more
                        minorities, or was it that the interest and the pool just wasn't there. I've
                        heard people say, well, we concentrated too much on the traditionally black
                        colleges, which have never really been competitive, with the exception maybe
                        of Howard. But if you really want it to go, you've got to go to the
                        Harvards, the Yales, the top schools in the United States who also for a
                        long time have been making special efforts to get this. And the traditional
                        black colleges are not the way to go. Were you able to go the recruiting
                        people and say change it around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Well today we do not, but in those days we had two programs; we had
                    the regular FSO written examination recruitment program and we had a minority
                    junior officer recruitment program. Now for the regular JO recruitment program
                    our goal has always been to get a significant number of minorities through that
                    process, let's say 10, 15, 20%, more or less proportionate to the population,
                    through the regular.... It is futile to try to do that by going to the
                    historically black colleges, because they can't pass the written examination.
                    Black or white, if you go to a second class school you're not going to pass. I
                    went to Berkeley and had to take the exam three times! Stanford candidates can't
                    pass the first time, some do, but many don't. It's a tough exam, a very tough
                    exam. You have to be a top-flight student at a top-flight university to pass
                    this exam. So it's no use recruiting at secondary or third level universities.
                    They can't pass it. And that's what they were doing. And that's where most of
                    our minority JOs were coming from. The mistake I think we make, we don't need
                    that many minorities, we recruit a couple of hundred officers a year, what do we
                    need, 30 or 40? You have to recruit them individually. You have to do it on the
                    basis of personal contact. That's the way IBM and AT&amp;T do it. We just throw
                    nets to the wind, we send an officer down to Atlanta to talk to historically
                    black colleges. One officer talking to a room of 30, 40, 50 people, no personal
                    contact. You're not going to recruit top-flight candidates that way. If you want
                    to get an MBA out of Harvard, or someone with a Master's degree in economics —
                    which is what their white counterparts have — or a Master's degree candidate out
                    of Tufts School of Law and Diplomacy or Georgetown School of Foreign Service,
                    you've got to talk to the man or the woman. You've got to go see them and say I
                    want to recruit you to the Foreign Service. We don't do that. We put ads in
                    papers, we speak to groups of 30 or 40, and we wait to see what comes up. And
                    the really good, the really successful, who can go out and make a place in the
                    economy, they don't come to us in sufficient numbers. That's the problem in my
                    opinion, then and now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the other issues that you were dealing
                        with. Let's concentrate on this one time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: The Junior Officer Program and the Mid-Level Minorities and Women
                    Program completely monopolized my time. I didn't really have time to work on any
                    other issues, except one. A major contribution I made, I think, is we approached
                    the Educational Testing Service to recruit, to score candidates by cone. We had
                    tried various systems. We had required candidates to specify at the time of
                    application what kind of a cone they wanted...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cone being...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: This would be a kind of specialty within the FSO Corps. The cones
                    were Political, Economic, Administrative, and Consular. We had various
                    techniques over time. At one time the candidate had to specify which of the four
                    at time of application. But they had no knowledge. We tried that for two or
                    three years and then threw that out. We tried recruiting everybody without
                    regard to cone. That didn't work very well. But I thought that we could do both.
                    So I said to the Educational Testing Service, now that we have computers can't
                    we designate each question on the exam as administrative, consular, economic,
                    political, or general or all or whatever, and based on the score of the
                    candidates come out with a profile that says his score as an administrative
                    candidate is 60, as a political candidate is 70, as an economic candidate is 80
                    and as consular is 32. They said “Yes.” I said, “Let's do it!” And let's put
                    people on multiple registers, the same candidate, and his place on each register
                    is based on his score on the exam. And then we call up the candidate and say:
                    “We offer you a job in the Foreign Service as an economic officer.” And he says
                    “Oh, I don't want to be economic, I want to be political.” And you say, “Well,
                    you're a third way down in the register, if you want to wait you can wait, if
                    you want to take this, you can take this. You can do whatever you want.” It was
                    his decision what to do.</p>
                <p>That, I thought, ...because we had the women's class action suit hanging over us,
                    and they had been making for years conal determinations administratively, and
                    these administrative determination of cones resulted in a lawsuit that said that
                    it wasn't done objectively, it wasn't being done impartially and without bias.
                    So I wanted to make it scientific. So I presented that channel to the Director
                    General and it was approved and we implemented it. It's been thrown out since
                    (because the exam was biased), but it lasted several years. I thought that was
                    the way to do it. So that's one of the contributions I made.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, give a little feel of the atmospherics. You
                        mentioned the women's suit. It was a women's class action suit which they
                        eventually won, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: They lost in District Court and they won on appeal. The issue was
                    whether they had been discriminated against in recruitment, employment,
                    assignments, promotions, awards, and conal designations.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Oh yeah, sure. I testified in the women's class action suit. And I
                    supervised later, because I was only in this job for a year, and then I moved up
                    to DAS for Personnel, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Personnel, I supervised the
                    presentation of all the documentation to the lawyers for the womens' class
                    action suit, answered their questions and so forth and then gave testimony
                    personally.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression at the time, after coming in and
                        out of Washington...We had a Secretary of State who had, who was coming from
                        the idea that...and also the Carter administration which was very strong on
                        minorities and women's representation and all, up against the sort of corps
                        of the Foreign Service. What was your impression of the State Department and
                        the people who were involved, not just the Secretary of State but on down,
                        in the problem, how they were looking at it and all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I thought they were making a lot of mistakes. Earlier in my career I
                    had never really dealt with the most senior level. When I dealt with the State
                    Department I was dealing with an institution, so from Madrid and within here, I
                    saw a lot of what I considered to be bad decisions. I'm not talking about
                    diplomacy now, I'm taking about internal management of the State Department, the
                    Foreign Service. And my disillusionment was to learn that those decisions were
                    made at the very highest level, by Secretary of State Vance, or Under
                    Secretaries. I thought some bureaucrat made them, or that Gershenson made them,
                    and I was going to help them fix them. And I found out that the Ben Reeds of
                    this world are making them and you couldn't do anything about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these decisions made just off the top of the hat or
                        were they being done to be, which term was not then in use but is in use
                        today, to be politically correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: This business of canceling the September class two weeks before it
                    was to start. That's the epitome of a bad decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This sounds like spite. it sounds like somebody saying,
                        “Well, if the system can't respond to me then I'm going to stick it to
                        them.”</hi>

                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: That's exactly what it was. We're going to punish the bureaucracy
                    because the bureaucracy is not responding to us. Even today you hear this same
                    talk, that minorities are under-represented, I had heard Perry over at Secretary
                    of Defense saying minorities are under-represented, and that's what they told me
                    then. If Ben Reed or Secretary Vance had given the Office of Recruitment maybe
                    as little as $200,000 for travel money and for officers to go out and do what I
                    said was required, to press flesh and personally recruit people — I did a little
                    of that personally, I got two trips, I went to Puerto Rico and recruited some
                    Hispanics down there and I went to Los Angeles and tried to recruit some Asians.
                    I got two trips. If we had a couple of hundred thousand in travel money we could
                    recruit minorities. Do you think they would give us $200,000? Well, it's not
                    THAT important!</p>

                        question. We've talked about ethnic things, but what about women? Women come
                        through at about 51% of the nation, and they also, even in this period, were
                        coming through the best universities at about the same level as the
                        so-called white male officer. They were getting the same education. The
                        problem with the recruitment of minorities, mainly Hispanic and black, was
                        that they weren't getting the same quality education. But women were. So I
                        would think that getting the right number of women would not be a problem.
                        Or was there a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: No, at the junior level there was not a problem. Well, it's a problem
                    depending on how you define the problem. If you define the problem as needing a
                    proportion of the population, then we weren't. We were not getting 50% women. If
                    you define the problem the way I defined it and some others defined it, we were
                    doing quite well. If you do a study, which we did, of what kind of university
                    degrees provide the background to be a Foreign Service Officer, then you come up
                    with six or seven, history, political science, international relations,
                    economics, foreign studies, and so forth. If you then go over to the Education
                    Department and find out how many women major in these subjects and you get the
                    percentages, we were able to meet those percentages. Because the percentage of
                    American women who go to the university and major in these subjects was
                    something like 25%. And 25% of FSOs were women. It's now more like 30.</p>
                <p>So the problem with women was the hierarchy profile. The number of ambassadors,
                    of minister-counselors, middle-grade officers. The reason for that problem is
                    very clear and very simple, but I had a hell of a time explaining it. I
                    explained to them that I am a senior officer, white male, because I was a junior
                    officer white male 15 years ago. And 15 years ago there were no women junior
                    officers. They were 3%. So don't worry that there are only 3% of senior
                    officers, that's the reason. And the way to fix that is through time. You fix it
                    at the bottom and 15 years later it's solved.</p>

                    in 15 years. They want it done this year, and the only way to do that is bring

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, Clint, you remember what we were talking about. You
                        became the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Personnel, where you served from
                        1980-84. Now exactly what were you doing? What was your bailiwick.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: There were two DAS's. The other one, who was Ron Palmer at first and
                    later Andy Steigman, had Foreign Service counseling and assignments. Kind of a
                    biggie on the Foreign Service side. They also had Policy Coordination and
                    performance evaluation.</p>
                <p>I had the civil service, foreign service nationals, and all of the systems —
                    recruitment, examination, employment...the executive director of management,
                    promotion numbers, limited career extension numbers, and the structure of the
                    Foreign Service side of the house. I had the computer systems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now having a sort of a broader perspective, I mean you'd
                        been in recruitment, but you had this one level above how in this period of
                        '80 to '84 how did you see the recruitment of minorities going, especially
                        at the mid-level.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Well, there were quite a few false starts. I'll explain a couple of
                    them. I considered it largely an unsuccessful program, and it had a very high
                    fail rate, which is another test. If you want to test by eating the pudding,
                    over 50% washed out. Prior to my time Secretary Vance had set what they in those
                    days called “goals and timetables.” And those goals at the mid-level were 20 a
                    year for five years to bring in 100 middle grade officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about minorities, essentially blacks and
                        Hispanics, right.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: At the mid-level, minorities was essentially a euphemism for blacks.
                    It did include Hispanics, American Indians, Asians, but their numbers were
                    minuscule, and there was almost no effort, targeted recruitment toward them. The
                    efforts were toward blacks. That program had been established I guess a year or
                    two years before I became the Deputy. They had not recruited 20 a year. They
                    were getting about 10, 10-12 a year, and more than half of those were women. So
                    the program in that way was largely unsuccessful. Secretary Vance was unhappy,
                    Ben Reed was unhappy. They were pounding on Harry Barnes and me as to why we
                    couldn't do better, and they established... By the way, the goals at the junior
                    level were 33 a year, of minorities only. They didn't count women at the junior
                    level.</p>
                <p>They established, again before my time, or during my time, the piggyback system.
                    It just shows you how crazy management can be. The piggyback system was “Your
                    goal this year is 20. You didn't get 20, you only got 12.” The deficit gets
                    added to next year's goal. So next year's goal is 28. Well, if you can't get 20
                    then you can't get 28! Same with the juniors. You've got a goal of 33, you get
                    25, next year your goal is 41. Most of the effort I would call bureaucratic. It
                    was such things as piggyback, such things as chew Lauderdale out, such things as
                    break the back of the resistance of the Foreign Service to recruiting minorities
                    — when basically none of those were the problem! The problem was, if you want to
                    recruit 20 minorities, you have to do a lot of targeted recruiting. If IBM
                    wanted to recruit 20 mid-level minorities, why they'd scour the countryside with
                    head hunters. We weren't doing that. What were we doing? Well, we were putting
                    an ad in the paper. The second thing was that the recruitment system was
                    ineffective in the way it was established bureaucratically. To bring in
                    these...the legal means of appointing these people,, they looked for a niche in
                    the Foreign Service Act, which is kind of restrictive on bringing in outsiders.
                    They looked for a niche and used it instead of changing the law or changing the
                    rule to recruit minorities, like the rest of the world might do.</p>
                <p>We had what was called a lateral entry program, by which people could enter the
                    Foreign Service laterally, which means mid-level, but it required three years of
                    service. And it was designed deliberately for a civil servant, who might want to
                    get into the Foreign Service and who might be needed. That was the reason it was
                    in there, and it wasn't perceived as violating the merit system rules. But we
                    were recruiting people outside of government. Almost all of our mid-levels came
                    from outside. So the lateral entry three years of service doesn't fit very well.
                    So they established a two-tier system. First you recruit them and hire them as
                    an FSR, until they have three years of service, and then you examine them to
                    become a Foreign Service officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And by that time they're well in the system and it's tough
                        to get them out.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: That wasn't the problem. The problem was that the lateral entry
                    system required an oral examination by the Board of Examiners. And the
                    Department recruited people, trained them, sent them overseas, let them
                    accumulate three years service, they applied for lateral entry and then failed
                    the exam. They also took an exam when they were hired, including an oral exam.
                    But it was not by the Board of Examiners, it was by somebody else. So this came
                    to be called a “second oral.” And the second oral was knocking out about 50% of
                    the people. It was the oral, but they called it the second oral. So one of the
                    proposals shortly after I took office, and this program was only partially
                    successful, Phil Habib, who had been Deputy Secretary and who had retired, and
                    was out in Stanford teaching graduate students, three of his graduate students
                    who were women at Stanford, at his encouragement had taken the FSO exam and
                    failed the oral. And he complained to Secretary Vance and said something is
                    wrong with this examination. And Secretary Vance was unhappy with it anyway,
                    because it wasn't working for the mid-level minorities program. So he appointed
                    a committee to study the recruitment examination process, which came to be
                    called the Habib Committee. The Habib Committee began before I became Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary; Habib was chairman, members were Diego Asencio, George
                    Moose, Ron Palmer, and Paul Boeker. They let me be on it as executive director,
                    even though I was in Personnel, director of recruitment, because I had only been
                    on the job two weeks. They made a series of recommendations, I don't remember,
                    12 or 13, but two of them that come to mind were, one was to abolish the
                    so-called second oral, and secondly, at the junior level, minorities could be
                    recruited into the Foreign Service without taking the written examination. The
                    Foreign Service Officer examination, as you know, is basically a two-tier
                    examination. It's a written examination and then subsequently, for the passers,
                    it's an oral examination. It's essentially an assessment center all day oral.
                    But minorities could be invited into the oral, based on meeting certain
                    qualifications and applicant screening, without having passed the written. The
                    pass rate wasn't very high. The candidates were different than the exam-passer
                    candidates in a number of ways. They were almost all bachelor degree candidates,
                    whereas almost half of written exam passers have Master's degrees. They were
                    younger. They just got their bachelor's degree kind of last week, and they're 22
                    years old. And the exam taker has a Master's degree and is 26 and worked for two
                    years. So they weren't equal candidates but they were thrown into the oral. The
                    fail rate was pretty high.</p>
                <p>On the other hand the minorities who passed the written examination did very well
                    in the oral. So one of the ideas that the Habib Committee came up with, which
                    caused quite a flurry at the time, was to admit minorities into the exam if
                    their score was within 5 points of the pass rate on the written. So to be a
                    white male you had to make 70 to go into the oral, but if you were a minority
                    you'd be invited if you made 65.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>There was another flap about that too. There was a radio program, Crossfire with
                    Tom Brady and Pat Buchanan — it's now a TV program — and they interviewed me
                    about this near pass business. Brady thought it was okay, Buchanan was against
                    it. I had to defend it, of course, and the lawyers approved it. It was
                    subsequently found to be illegal, contrary to regulations. It wasn't illegal
                    under the law, but it violated our own regulations, which had been published in
                    the Federal Register, even though “L” previously said okay. But as soon as
                    somebody filed a grievance, they came around and said “somebody made a mistake.”
                    Harry Barnes was livid at the lawyers. So we had to go back and invite all exam
                    takers who had made 65 for that year. So we gave oral exams to another couple of
                    hundred people that we didn't want to examine and didn't need to, and wasted
                    resources. But since we had invited the minorities, we had to. Still, that
                    didn't produce all that many. So nothing seemed to work, nothing being what the
                    Department was doing. They were placing advertisements in black magazines for
                    mid-level and junior officers and visiting black colleges. And that's just not
                    enough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well here you are, you're the Deputy Assistant Secretary,
                        basically this is on your plate. So what happened during the '80-'84 period?
                        I mean, I was on the Board of Examiners from '74-'75, and we knew that the
                        black colleges weren't the place to go. That was part of the problem
                        knocking down these lateral entries. They just weren't of the same caliber.
                        It's not surprising. When you're going after a real elite, once you move
                        down there's a real falling off. This would be true if you were going after
                        white postal workers. Were you able to make any dent or do anything about
                        this problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Well, we tried a few kind of imaginative, but cheap, things. I tried
                    a couple of things. One is I tried to get more travel money to permit people to
                    go out and recruit — other than what we were doing. And I couldn't get it. I
                    tried through the Public Affairs speaker program to get them to include in their
                    speaker's program, where diplomats go out to foreign affairs councils making
                    speeches, to tag on a ten-minute at the end and talk about Foreign Service
                    careers. They did it, but on a voluntary basis. Some speakers felt comfortable
                    doing that and some didn't. We tried to revive the diplomats-in-residence, I
                    think we had ten of those at universities and get them to travel to other
                    universities in their state. They were willing, and I called up the one in
                    Oregon, for instance, and asked him if he'd do it and he said, “Yeah, how much
                    travel money can I have?” And guess what I said — “None. I don't have any for
                    you.” And he said, “OK, I'll do it at my own expense.” So a few got in their own
                    car and took off around the state and others said, send me travel money and I'll
                    do it, otherwise I'm not going to.” It was a resource-poor program in that
                    sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you had the Secretary of State really committed to
                        this, why wasn't it getting translated into money?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I think they really didn't believe we were sincere, and thought this
                    was just a ploy. Like a good bureaucrat who would say if you want this or that,
                    give me money. And if we were really avid and sincere, not only me but the whole
                    Foreign Service, that this would work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it then the time you were there this particular
                        problem you didn't feel was really met full on or solved.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: No they were not. The problems were different at the mid-level than
                    at the junior level. A mid-level program in a culture and structure like the
                    Foreign Service is a very ambitious program. We brought in a lot of women, for
                    example, who were not in the normal sense of the word disadvantaged and were not
                    minorities. These people had Master's degrees, they were well educated, they
                    came from middle or upper class families. Some of them failed too. The fail rate
                    wasn't as high, but they failed because they would go in at mid-level in the
                    Ankara, Turkey, Embassy and they have to compete with an officer that's been in
                    the Foreign Service eight or ten years and has had two or three prior posts. He
                    knows all the bureaucratic structure, how things operate, everything —
                    performance evaluations, how to get promoted, how to get a job. And this person
                    who came from Seattle a few months ago has got a tremendous learning curve.
                    That's just on the bureaucratic, self-survival side. Then on the work side
                    they've got the same thing. They've never been a Political Officer or Economic
                    Officer before and their competitors have. So their promotions were slower. And
                    then if you add to that that the person is a minority, may not have the same
                    educational background, maybe has a Bachelor's degree instead of a Master's,
                    there's a pretty big disadvantage there.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>At the junior level I think the fail rate...at the junior level they didn't have
                    to pass a second oral but they had to get tenure after three years. We had
                    started recruiting junior officers untenured, and the minority junior officers
                    were usually younger, they usually just had a Bachelor's degree, which usually
                    was not in Political Science, and they didn't go to Fletcher School of Law and
                    Diplomacy the way their white counterpart had. They went to Mississippi
                    University and studied education, and that just doesn't have the same
                    preparation. So they had the same kind of curve, or incline to climb up. What
                    was needed really was more in-service training, counseling, and preparation. But
                    under the law and under our situation, you can't do that just for blacks. So
                    they tried to, and they'd make it available to everybody of course, they put
                    continuity counselors in Foreign Service Counseling and Assignment, they were
                    really there to help the minorities. A white person out of ignorance might go in
                    there and think he could get this counseling too, and if he did he would, but
                    that's not what it was set up for. So we did some things, but I think the reason
                    it didn't work was the white candidates had a much longer incubation period.
                    They knew when they were a junior or senior in college, or even earlier, that
                    they wanted to be in the Foreign Service. So they went to the Georgetown School
                    of Foreign Service or Tufts or Berkeley the way I did. That was their goal and
                    they prepared for it for eight years. Whereas the minorities, by and large, we
                    caught them in June of their graduate year and they had majored in education and
                    we recruited them into the Foreign Service. So what we needed was much more lead
                    time, and I expressed that in one of the meetings upstairs where we were getting
                    raked over the coals because we weren't getting enough and why don't you get ten
                    in next month's class. I said, “You know, I'm like the farmer that you're
                    telling to go out and harvest the wheat and nobody planted it. This takes a long
                    lead time. If you want to harvest in the fall, you've got to plant in the
                    spring. You're saying go harvest, but did it rain? Did the seed get planted in
                    the ground? No!” So that was my view of the program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the other major issues you dealt with
                        during this '80-'84 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Two other biggies. One was, there was an election in 1980, and after
                    several years of Democratic rule, a conservative Republican, a distrustful
                    Republican administration came into office, and that produced somewhat of a
                    shock. The second was the Foreign Service Act of 1980, that was enacted and
                    signed in the fall of 1980 under the previous Administration had a 90-day
                    effective date and was to take effect January 14, 1981, and the new
                    Administration came into office January 20, 1981, so implementing the new
                    Foreign Service Act and all of its ramifications. And a third big one was we
                    were in the throes of a women's class action suit, and it came to trial during
                    that period and I gave depositions, three days worth of depositions, and later
                    testified in court, very shortly it turned out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we continue discussing the structure of the
                        Foreign Service by going ahead with the women's class action suit. What was
                        the problem during your time, and how did it work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: My time was the so-called period of discovery, when the lawyers were
                    gathering information from the Department. So they were amassing and analyzing
                    data. The suit had been filed quite a few years before, I think '74, but under
                    the law a class action suit covers from the day it is filed until the date of
                    the trial so it covered what was going on today as well. It had alleged
                    discrimination in recruitment, employment, awards, assignments, conal
                    assignments, ambassadorships, practically the whole range. We settled out of
                    court the recruitment/examination/employment part of the case, and the rest of
                    it went to trial.</p>
                <p>The part on which the Department was most vulnerable and was probably the cutting
                    edge of why the Department lost that case was on conal assignments. A lot of the
                    testimony was on conal assignments. And the fact is that women and minorities
                    coming into the Foreign Service were disproportionately assigned to consular and
                    administrative cones. That was point number one. Point number two, the
                    administrative and consular cones were deemed to be second-class citizens, their
                    chances for advancement to the senior ranks and the chance to be awarded with
                    top jobs, such as ambassadorships, DCMs, Assistant Secretaries, and DAS, were
                    deemed to be lower. And one can prove that statistically pretty easily. So on
                    both counts, the Department was vulnerable. The third reason they were really
                    vulnerable is that by and large these women and minorities had been assigned to
                    their cones administratively; that is, by some Board or consultation between two
                    officers who were usually white males. Of course there was some rationale for
                    some difference. As I told you before, the white male probably graduated from
                    Georgetown School of Foreign Service and the minority candidate may have
                    graduated from the University of Tennessee with a degree in education. You look
                    at that and say, “Well, education, that's probably consular. Georgetown School
                    of Foreign Service, that's probably political.” And that's one of the reasons
                    they lost it. They won in the District Court, because the testimony of the
                    witnesses couldn't sustain a finding for the plaintiffs. They weren't able to
                    prove overt, deliberate discrimination. And so they lost. But on appeal, they
                    won on statistics, by and large.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You weren't in charge of placement, but you were sitting
                        at the council of the mighties within Personnel at that time. The suit was
                        pending, there must have been a lot of self-examination. I mean, hell, I
                        knew what we were doing and there was justification for it but at the same
                        time qualified people were getting put in the wrong places. In '80-'84, what
                        were we doing in the seats of Personnel to rectify the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Another factor was that during the Carter Administration, President
                    Carter himself, to some extent I think, set the tone. But certainly people like
                    Cyrus Vance and Ben Reed were very high on this program. It was important to
                    them. It was an important motivation of what they wanted to achieve. And
                    everybody knew it and that was their marching orders. When the Reagan
                    Administration came in the rhetoric was quite different. They didn't seem to be
                    very interested in that and their appointments of ambassadors and assistant
                    secretaries and DAS's didn't seem to reflect any particular desire for balance
                    in those areas. Within the Department and in the Foreign Service the blacks felt
                    that by and large the program had been killed. It hadn't actually been killed,
                    it just didn't have the enthusiasm that was there before, maybe it didn't have
                    the rhetoric or the managerial attention. So subsequently they filed a black
                    class action suit because they didn't perceive that things were happening... So
                    the five years elapsed. We didn't have 100, we had about 80. We continued the
                    program and in year six, we passed 100. That was during my time. We wrote a
                    letter to the Under Secretary for Management and told him that we have now
                    recruited 120 and the goals were 100 and it took us six and a half years instead
                    of five, and so forth. And they approved stopping the mid-level program. In the
                    meantime, at the junior level they also stopped bringing in minorities without
                    having taken the written examination, for various reasons. The fail rate was
                    fairly high, there was a new attitude and atmosphere. There was a lot of
                    criticism of what people felt were quotas, that the Carter Administration had
                    quotas and we don't believe in quotas, quotas are illegal. And I must admit that
                    the Carter Administration did kind of talk out of both sides of their mouth.
                    They also said quotas are illegal and we don't have any, but your quota is 20 a
                    year. Also, people like me, at least for the first year, were not going to be on
                    the cutting edge of anything. We felt that we weren't trusted. We felt suspect.
                    I didn't even know if I was going to be kept on as DAS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the Reagan Administration looking on
                        you as “one of those Foreign Service guys.” It had nothing to do
                        with...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Well, not only that. People who were ambassadors and to some degree
                    DAS's, we were Carter DAS's, we must be Democrats and not quite to be trusted.
                    And when the Administration came in almost one of their first acts was to fire
                    Harry Barnes. He was Director General of the Foreign Service, and he was
                    precipitously replaced early on. And his two deputies...we didn't know what was
                    going to happen. We were without a DG for a couple of months until Joan Clark
                    got back and took over, and during that inter-regnum which was partially during
                    the transition, I think Harry left office on January 20, if not before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this because he was Harry Barnes? He was in bad odor
                        with some of the Republicans because of being too friendly with the
                        Romanians, wasn't that it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: That came later. I don't actually know why, except that he was a
                    Carter Administration Director General. The Foreign Service Act itself was sort
                    of suspect too. This is some law passed by the Democrats, we better read it very
                    carefully. I think Harry was perceived as a liberal. They started appointing
                    ambassadorships and pretty soon they were all assigned, by let's say June or so,
                    they were all lined up and Harry didn't have one. So either Ben Reed the old M,
                    or the new M told the Secretary that it would really be a very bad signal to the
                    Foreign Service if you replace the DG and don't give him another job. And since
                    a lot of middle-level embassies to which he might have aspired under the
                    circumstances were already given, they gave him India, one of the few that was
                    left. So he came out well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there til '84, so how did this work? Did you see
                        a settling in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Well, during the transition and during the early days there was a lot
                    of tension. I felt a lot of tension and stress. It's hard to be objective about
                    that. But in some cases, in retrospect, I think it was no more than just dealing
                    with strangers who had some innovative ideas but they scared the hell out of me.
                    One was, for example, that they were going to have...We have the Under Secretary
                    for Political Affairs, it's always been filled by a career officer,
                    historically. It was the highest career job in the State Department. They wanted
                    to appoint a political Under Secretary for Political Affairs. And I said,
                    “That's a bad idea. Where is the interface going to be between the career
                    diplomats and the political appointees? That's where it's been in the past, and
                    if you wipe that out you lose that interface that's very important to the
                    Secretary and it's always been...” So they call me back and I got such words as
                    “California wants...” California being the Reagan transition team that was still
                    out there, so they call and say “Give me a list of all Under Secretaries for
                    Political Affairs for the last 20 years, indicating whether they were career or
                    non-career.” That's a lot of work, sometimes you can't even find it. But we did
                    it, and, by the way, one of them was non-career. Then they wanted to appoint
                    some Consul General that was non- career, and I told them the same thing.
                    Consuls General are career officers, those are not political appointments,
                    they're not made by the President. They're made under the authority of the
                    Secretary of State, and there's no real mechanism to appoint...they have to be
                    in the Foreign Service and there's no mechanism to...the old FSRs have been
                    killed by the Foreign Service Act of 1980 — what are you going to appoint them
                    as? Same story. Give me a list of all non-career Consuls-General of the last 20
                    years. So we did that. And we found a couple. But they weren't really
                    non-career. They were technically non-career, but they had spent most of their
                    life in the government or in the State Department. They weren't career Foreign
                    Service. They might have been in the civil service of the State Department for
                    15 years or something. We carried the day with our Secretary of Political
                    Affairs. They did appoint a career officer. On the Consuls General, they
                    appointed one political one in Bermuda — and that's lost forever to the Foreign
                    Service. It's now a tradition that it will be political. So there were some
                    strains like that.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>We had a lot of FSRs, who, under the old act could be appointed domestically, and
                    a lot of the political appointees in the building were Foreign Service Reserve
                    Officers. The new Act of 1980 prohibited the appointment of Foreign Service
                    Officers for domestic service only. So they wanted to do two things, one, get
                    rid of all the ones from the previous administration and secondly they wanted to
                    know “How are we going to appoint our folks?” So that created some stress. We
                    identified 87 people who were non career, either non-career SES or FSRs, wrote
                    them a letter, saying we no longer have trust and faith in you and so forth, and
                    who's going to sign this letter? Well, they decided Lauderdale's going to sign
                    this letter, because there was no Director General and they wanted a career
                    officer to sign it and that was me. So I signed the letters to 87 people. I
                    always worried later that that might hurt my career, but nothing ever came of
                    it. Even when the Clinton Administration came in, I thought they might look to
                    see who did us in when Reagan came in. But nobody ever held a grudge against me
                    personally. So that was one of the sources of tensions, and then the third thing
                    was... So I felt sort of under stress, under probation, so I wasn't in a mode to
                    take a lot of new initiatives or to be a firefighter on, let's say, such things
                    as affirmative action, particularly when the message and image of the new
                    Administration was “We're not very interested in that.” So if I don't push for
                    those things, who is? And the answer was, at the Senior level nobody did. So the
                    program just basically continued along, it wasn't killed, it wasn't even
                    de-emphasized, it just wasn't a high priority program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was probably happening all throughout the government,
                        wouldn't you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes it was, and there was publicity about it in the papers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because it's not just having a program, the bureaucracy
                        has to both be engaged and know that there'll be some follow through. Well
                        Clint, what about the other thing you were...you've already alluded to some
                        of the other problems, but I mean, the new Foreign Service Act came in in
                        1980 after you took... sometimes called the Act of '81, because that's when
                        it came into effect. In the first place, as you were sitting in Personnel
                        before it came in and looking at this thing, it was already a done deal by
                        the time you got there, but what was the feeling within Personnel about this
                        Act?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: By and large, I think, enthusiasm. And by and large we felt that it
                    would resolve a lot of the existing problems in the Foreign Service. Now there
                    were some provisions in there that I didn't like personally, and that I opposed,
                    personally. But the system was bigger than any of us individually, so there
                    wasn't anything we could do about it. For example, I didn't favor performance
                    pay. I thought it was a lost concept, but the rest of the government had it, and
                    civil service had it, OPM set it up in the law and said that for the civil
                    service and the SES, and it became a common part of the pay structure. So to say
                    that you can't have it for the Foreign Service is just not feasible.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>I didn't agree with the concept of the window. The new Act reemphasized the “up
                    and out” principle. There had not been a retirement for time in class in the
                    senior ranks for a long time. It was moribund, because the time in class had
                    been 12 years at the lowest senior grade and 10 years at the highest senior
                    grade. Those are OC and MC now. And Eagleburger, when he was Under Secretary for
                    Management, to avoid a specific officer retiring, merged the two into 22 years
                    combined. And the result was that nobody reached 22 years. They reached age 60
                    before they reached 22 years. And it was deemed desireable to reactivate the up
                    or out principle for senior officers and lower that. And to have a junior
                    threshold, which we had, establish a senior threshold with time in class to
                    cross the threshold or you're out and then a time in class for the senior ranks
                    with limited career extension. In establishing the senior threshold, it was
                    deemed desireable to establish a window. It was believed that officers shouldn't
                    be allowed and the system shouldn't be required to keep officers for promotion
                    indefinitely. The theory was, well, you really ought to be promoted within seven
                    years. If you get reviewed for seven years and you don't get promoted we're not
                    going to review you any more and you're no longer eligible for promotion. I
                    thought that was okay, it didn't bother me at all. But then they took it one
                    step further and said, well, it you reach the point in your career where you're
                    no longer eligible for promotion, you ought to be forced to retire because
                    you're not motivated, we don't have the EER to hold over your head, you may lay
                    down on the job, and therefore you've got to be forced out. I didn't agree with
                    that, and that's causing us to retire a lot of people today who are not senior
                    manager talent or motivated, but they're quite good technocrats or whatever, and
                    a lot of them could stay. We could say, look, we're not going to compete you any
                    more for senior rank, it's pretty clear to us and to you that that's not your
                    niche, but you can be what you are. But anyway, they established a window, you
                    “open” your window, which means you click the seven years competitive time, and
                    if you're not promoted within that time you're no longer competed and you must
                    retire.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>The framework at the time, it all fit very nicely. Claude Pepper was chairman of
                    the Committee on Aging, at that time he was Congressman from Florida, and he
                    forced through... I shouldn't say forced through, it's kind of derogatory... His
                    momentum and public speaking and persuasion convinced the nation that there
                    shouldn't be a retirement age, that people should retire based on productivity
                    and that there are a lot of differences in energy and health and motivation and
                    performance of people that is not just as simple as saying how old are you. So
                    he abolished, by and large, by law, retirement age in the private sector and in
                    the government. Now the Foreign Service had this age 60 retirement, and he
                    wanted it abolished. And everybody kind of shook their head, and they
                    compromised by elevating it to age 65, which he bought provided that the Foreign
                    Service in its career progression system and its “up or out” system would retain
                    people based on their performance and not on some other factor. So, they put
                    into the law limited career extensions, authority for “up or out,” authority for
                    time in class, but with a provision for limited career extensions. So what the
                    structure was envisioned and what we created — because the law only said you are
                    authorized” — was a system of fairly short time in class for senior officers. Up
                    to the senior threshold it was already set at 25 years. If you get promoted
                    across the senior threshold into the senior service, you have a fairly short
                    time in class; six years in the first grade, five in Minister Counselor, and
                    four at CM with a provision for an extension for three years. And you could get
                    multiple extensions, you could get reviewed every three years for another three
                    years if you didn't get promoted. That was also deemed to solve the problem - we
                    had career ministers with no time in class limit under the old system who
                    wouldn't take a job that we wanted them to take and they only wanted to be
                    Ambassador to Germany or India or something, and we didn't need them for that
                    and they wouldn't do anything else, but they didn't have to retire. And the
                    numbers weren't great, but they were significant. At any one time there might be
                    five or six. They have it again right now. So we said you get four years as a
                    career minister, and if you do a good job and if you're needed and if you take
                    the job we want you to take, you'll get an extension. And if you don't, you get
                    to retire. So that structure was set up, and then one of the big issues was how
                    do you compete for that career extension. Well my colleague Andy Steigman wanted
                    it to be across the board. And I said, “No Way,” you're going to extend all the
                    political officers and then we don't have jobs for them. The only people that
                    are over complement right now are political officers. We don't have over
                    complement consular or administrative officers. They're needed, there are jobs
                    for them, and they will take them. So we have to compete by cone. And he
                    eventually came around to that, and we will give numbers by cone. Well, we had
                    the problem that some people didn't have a cone. Harry Barnes, for example, had
                    no cone. So we said we have to give him a cone for LCE competition purposes. And
                    I think career minister may be the class where we competed them as a class. But
                    minister counselor...because some of our administrative and some of our consular
                    officers are minister counselors, and they are quite happy to go be Consul
                    General in Rome or Toronto or Mexico and so forth, so for minister counselor and
                    OC I won out and we said we'll give LCEs by cone.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>Performance pay - same thing, they wanted to give it across the board and I said
                    “No.” The first year, we had across to the board competition for performance
                    pay. It was an embarrassment. Ninety percent of the recipients were ambassadors.
                    And there were complaints in the press, and M complained and said, “Fix that.”
                    And I said, “Folks we have to compete these by different competition rules.”
                    Also, an OC really shouldn't compete with an MC for performance pay. So we set
                    up three competition zones for MC and one for OC. Then it began to work better.
                    I didn't believe in performance pay anyway. It never worked well and it still
                    doesn't work well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, I received performance pay because they had an
                        earthquake in my district, for no other reason than that. I did what I was

                <p>LAUDERDALE: You know LCE extensions are now dead, they killed them. It's too bad
                    in my opinion. The system was defective and it should have been fixed. But they
                    didn't fix it, they just abolished it. But reflecting back I wonder if I made a
                    mistake. The way we actually did the numbers was... first of all you have to
                    accept the principle that an LCE competes with a promotion. You can either
                    extend an existing officer, let's say a minister counselor, or you can promote
                    an OC into that opportunity. So we added up all the opportunities and we did
                    extension numbers first. We said, okay, we're going to extend so many people in
                    each group and there are so many promotions left. And that's the way the system
                    worked. One of the reasons we could do that was we had a means of fixing the
                    numbers for limited career extensions. It was 50% in one category and 60% in
                    another, and so forth. We didn't have a system for establishing promotion
                    numbers of any specific number. So the first year or two we did LCEs first and
                    promotions were the residual. Since we didn't have LCEs before and everybody was
                    coming up for time in class, as a transitional basis we took the entire
                    population, divided them into three tranches, and said you will come up for LCE
                    consideration in 1986, and you will come up in '87 and you will come up in '88.
                    So kind of idealistically I said to the system the LCE percentage opportunities
                    need to be identical for the three groups. And we had already had year 1, and
                    their percentage and chance was so much and so much. For example, Andy Steigman
                    was in year 1 and I was in year 2, so I said it's only fair that my chance for
                    extensions be just as great as his, and so forth. That was a little bit
                    misguided, looking back. Secretary Shultz brought in an outside CEO named Van
                    Gorkom to be Under Secretary for Management. He was going to bring business
                    practices to the State Department. He lasted one year and then quit! But in the
                    year that he was there, and he learned about this and we briefed him, because M
                    approves promotion numbers and LCE numbers. He said, “I want this process
                    reversed. We'll do promotion numbers first and let the chips fall with the
                    LCEs.” And I knew that everybody in Personnel was against that and I knew that
                    their mouths were agape. The DG was there and I was there, and various other
                    people, MMO and his staff group, and I was reflecting very quickly... Joan Clark
                    may have told him it's not possible, I don't remember, maybe she turned to me, I
                    guess she did. I said “We can do it, but for us to do it you have to tell us
                    what the promotion numbers are to be, so we can compute the residual.” I mean we
                    could just do it historically, add up the number of promotions from each class
                    over the last ten years and average it out and say the average has been 37, and
                    therefore there will be 37 promotions this year and the LCEs get the rest. But
                    the opportunities swing and sway from year to year. The total opportunities this
                    year might be 50 and you might say give 37 of them to promotions, but next year
                    the opportunities might be 70 — are you going to give 37 promotions and all the
                    rest of them to extensions? The extensions might actually exceed the number of
                    people to compete for extensions. So those are the problems. You have to fix the
                    promotion numbers if you're going to let the chips fall the other way, because
                    now the largesse goes to promotions and the lean years comes out of promotions,
                    because the LCE population is much smaller. And if you want to switch that
                    you're going to have to decide how you're going to set the promotion numbers.
                    What are you going to do if you end up with 100% extensions, for example? You
                    probably wouldn't want to do that. Are you going to have a provision for rolling
                    it back into a promotion? What if there are more extensions than there are
                    candidates? So there are a lot of questions to be resolved if you're going to do
                    it that way. And he said, “Well, let me think about all that.” So we broke up
                    and a week later he called up and said, “Forget it.” I don't know where he got
                    his advice, but... Actually there would be some merit, considerable merit, to
                    doing the promotion numbers first. The LCE system was stopped, and I think there
                    were two reasons. One, it was abused. The numbers were too high. A couple of
                    years they gave 100% to career ministers. That's ridiculous. And in the other
                    categories the numbers were too high. And then the people who wanted to get
                    promoted complained, of course. The second reason was that it was extremely
                    difficult to administer, because you had senior officers, sometimes serving
                    overseas, and their time ran out. If they got an extension, all was well. But if
                    they didn't, suddenly the assignments system said, “Oh, our man in Rome has got
                    to retire, unexpectedly. He was sent there for four years and he's only been
                    there for two.” And if they were here in Washington and they were coming up for
                    an extension review, they'd say, “Well, I'm not going overseas. You want me to
                    go to Manila? I'm coming up for an extension review next year, I'm not going to
                    go unless you tell me you're going to extend me.” “Well we can't tell you that.”
                    “Well I'm not going.” So they would linger around here because they only had a
                    year til their review. So for those reasons it was hard to administer for
                    assignments and hard to compute, they just stopped LCEs altogether. My solution
                    was to review two years before your time runs out instead of the last year.
                    There were ways that they could have fixed it: don't give 100%, set a limit, in
                    no grade will it ever be more than 50% or something like that. They destroyed
                    the principle that Claude Pepper espoused, that retirement should be based on
                    performance review. And the second thing they did is to create a system where
                    career ministers are walking around without jobs and you can't get rid of them
                    because when they stopped extensions, they increased the regular time. And
                    career ministers went from four years to ten, and they pooled the other two
                    (minister counselor + counselor). Seven years and five for counselors + minister
                    counselors would be 12. They changed that to combined 14 and said people are
                    going to come up slower and they've got 14 years. But we have people in the
                    Service who didn't come slow, people like Bob Ryan and George Moose and lots of
                    others, who under the 14 year rule, are going to be forced to retire at age 52,
                    53, because they made senior officer when they were age 38, 39, or 40. And
                    there's a fairly large number of them. They're coming up this year, next year,
                    and the year after, and they're all going to be thrown out unless there's a
                    reprieve. If you're serving in a presidential appointment, then you don't have
                    to retire. George Moose made career minister, and a few others will make career
                    minister and get that reprieve. A few will be serving as ambassadors and get
                    that reprieve. But the consuls and the administrative people and the political
                    and economic people who are not serving as ambassadors are going to get zapped
                    in fairly large numbers, fairly young, and the Department is losing a lot of
                    talent. So the whole thing isn't structured right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Clint, one other thing that was happening at this time
                        that I viewed with a certain amount of disquiet after I saw how it was being
                        put into effect, and that was the stress on “management.” This was up and
                        down the ranks...because it soon, the Foreign Service uses people of all
                        sorts of specialties, including somebody who may be an expert on Mongolia
                        and very good with that, and they don't really have to “manage” that much.
                        But it seems like there's much more of an effort to get your ticket punched.
                        You had to have this kind of job, that kind of job, in order to get
                        promoted, so that somebody who wanted to concentrate particularly on
                        language skills, which are bread and butter, I mean you want somebody who
                        really knows Balkan politics and Balkan languages and all that, and yet they
                        may find they can't spend the time doing it, at least that's my impression.
                        Could you talk about that during this '80 - '84 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Right. Let me start out by saying — it's not within the period, but —
                    I just met yesterday with Under Secretary Dick Moose on a management issue, and
                    he asked me... I had gone to Vienna to set up a Joint Administrative Office,
                    that's why I met with him, and he asked me how the one works in Brussels. It was
                    a trick question, he knew that there had been some strains in the past. And I
                    told him that there was a point in the past, three years ago specifically, when
                    two of the Ambassadors out there — Brussels has got three — wouldn't talk to
                    each other. They wouldn't take phone calls, they wouldn't go to meetings, they
                    wouldn't see each other. And a Joint Administrative Office in Brussels to serve
                    three missions won't work very well when two of the Ambassadors won't talk to
                    each other. Secondly, they don't work very well with the Joint Administrative
                    Office in the Embassy if the Embassy Ambassador does not understand that an
                    important part of his mission is to provide administrative support to the other
                    two missions. And sometimes you've had ambassadors there who appreciated that,
                    and it worked very well. And if you send one out who doesn't appreciate it, it's
                    not going to work very well. And sometimes you've sent out ambassadors who don't
                    give a damn about administration and management, and then these things are not
                    going to work very well. Right now, the one you have in Vienna (Swanee Hunt)
                    does. She's going to support not only the Embassy, but two other missions, and
                    if that's an important part of her mission, it's going to work well. If she
                    doesn't care, and says, I'm out here to have relations with Austria, then it's
                    going to collapse.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>Moose's answer was that he agrees with that, and that he's going to emphasize
                    management by having it at various levels of career at the Foreign Service
                    Institute. I give you that as background. Now, I am one of those people that
                    you're talking about who believes that management is an important part of an
                    ambassador's responsibility. The ambassador is not a political consultant; he is
                    not an expert diplomat, responsible only for diplomacy. Now that may be the
                    principal reason that he's out there, and we used to have ambassador's like that
                    in the 19th century. They had an aide and a secretary, and their job was
                    diplomacy, full time, dealing with the King of Spain or the Czar or whoever.
                    Those days are over. Our big embassies are fairly big government bureaucracies,
                    and the law gives the chief of mission a lot of authority and responsibility.
                    And that comes with the turf. he's not only prime diplomat, he's also prime
                    manager. And most of it cannot be delegated very well. In Bonn and Paris, as you
                    know, there are 22 U.S. government agencies, each with a head who reports back
                    to their Secretary. Now those folks will take orders from the Ambassador who is
                    a Presidential appointee, but they're not going to take orders from some State
                    Department diplomat. And by the way everybody else out there is State
                    Department, except the Ambassador. One of the unique things about ambassadors is
                    they say “I don't work for the State Department, I work for the President. I was
                    appointed by the President, I was approved by the Senate, I am the chief of this
                    mission under law. You will do what I say.” It works! But let the DCM try it.
                    Let the Political Counselor try it. And the Agricultural Minister will tell him
                    to go jump you know where. So it's inherent in the job, and when they accept it,
                    it works well.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>Oh, there's two other parts. I gave you some personal philosophy and observation,
                    the way I see it working. That is kind of the background that caused this to get
                    emphasized. But there were two other reasons; one reason gets into the career
                    and non-career. It started in the '70s, I think, when the DCM failure rate was
                    quite high. You know somewhere between 30 and 40% of our ambassadors are
                    non-career people. They did a survey and concluded that 50% of our DCMs were
                    failing, defining failure in a certain way: if the Ambassador sent them home, if
                    they didn't get a good onward assignment, or if they didn't get a good EER. And
                    it was deemed that they were failing largely because they weren't prepared to be
                    managers. Many of them, 80%, were from the political cone and had very little,
                    if any, managerial background, training, or experience and then they were thrown
                    in to be DCMs. They were good policy advisors to the ambassador but the other
                    things didn't work and the ambassador held them responsible. So they started a
                    DCM course. That was their solution to that. Then they started a week-long
                    ambassador's course, that was not management per se, but... Another thing that
                    they concluded was that very often the non-career ambassadors run better
                    embassies than the career ambassadors. The career ambassadors may be better
                    diplomats, and they usually serve in more sensitive countries and they did that
                    very well. But on the managerial side they often stubbed their toe, and some got
                    relieved because of the managerial side. Their personal conduct, morale is poor,
                    more than one ambassador has not gotten a second shot because morale was poor in
                    his embassy. Although on the diplomatic side he may have done exceedingly well.
                    I know that when Mr. Whitehead was Deputy Secretary, he complained to the
                    Inspector General, and that's why we started Inspector's efficiency reports on
                    ambassadors. He had two complaints. He said some of our ambassadors don't know a
                    damn thing about how to manage a post, and number two, we don't always know who
                    they are. So when candidates come up for ambassadorships, we want to know who
                    can manage and who can't, and the system doesn't tell us that. Their EERs are
                    written back in the Department and the Department doesn't know how they're
                    managing. You guys do. So we had a debate in OIG about how to do that. There had
                    been a period under Bill Harrop as the Inspector General, when inspectors
                    inspected a post they wrote a letter about the ambassador to the Secretary,
                    usually a page or page and a half long. But the Ambassador didn't know about
                    that. I've seen some of those letters. They eventually had to stop that, on
                    advice of attorneys. So we said, shall we do a letter? We went through that
                    legal history and the lawyer says you've got to be careful. That letter is
                    subject to the Freedom of Information Act and you haven't shown it to the
                    Ambassador, so, you know... We talked about putting it in inspection reports, no
                    that isn't a good idea. Well, let's use the inspectors efficiency report (IER).
                    I was given the job of implementing it. I said, okay, searched the regulations
                    to see if any new authority was needed and said “No, we can do it with what we
                    have.” But let's only do it on career officers. The Department does performance
                    evaluation reports on career ambassadors, but not on non-career ambassadors. It
                    makes me nervous as an inspection team leader to go out to Paris and do an
                    Inspector's efficiency on Pamela Harriman. Number two, the cable announcing it
                    should have management clearance. I mean, Mr. Whitehead asked for this, let's
                    ask him to clear on it. “Oh, I'm Inspector General, I have the authority.”</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>Yeah, still, you have authority to write it, but the DG doesn't have to put it in
                    the file. Okay, so I sold that. They sent it up to Mr. Whitehead to sign and
                    clear. He did. But he put a note on it: “include non-careers also.” So we did,
                    we sent it out, career and non-career. So that tells you. It wasn't just Mr.
                    Whitehead. Secretary Kissinger was frustrated sometimes because his Departments
                    couldn't manage. And it was the management, sometimes security or other
                    management... Look at Moscow! Hartman got into trouble and his name was
                    besmirched. It wasn't because of diplomacy, it was because of internal
                    administration, security consciousness, KGB got in the building, secrets
                    compromised. That's management, not diplomacy. These lines aren't very clear in
                    the Foreign Service. Management is diplomacy too, but it's not paying attention
                    to the managerial side that can sometimes... So it's important to the 7th floor
                    principals how the ambassador manages. We've been making management and
                    diplomacy two separate things, but often they are not all that separable. So for
                    all those reasons, it is perceived as important. So they still do IERs on
                    ambassadors today. IERs, and their performance in the field is still important
                    to the Secretary and Under Secretary. It's not more important than the diplomacy
                    side, it's just important. And some officers are not qualified to do it. They
                    are excellent candidates to be ambassador to Bulgaria or Czechoslovakia or
                    Thailand, but can they manage the establishment out there without getting the
                    Secretary or staff or somebody in trouble? And the answer sometimes is NO!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I saw this in one of the newly emerging ex-Soviet
                        Republics. I had an expert there who was...bad morale, who was a loner, bird
                        watcher, took a lot of long solitary hikes, and his staff was very unhappy.
                        But excellent, knowledgeable of the Russian system.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Could you give me your view of how, I think you had three Director Generals
                    running...Harry Barnes, Joan Clark, and Roy Atherton. Could you talk a little
                    about how they operated, because the role of Director General is an important
                    one.</p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Well, Harry was the most open, the most simpatico of the three. I
                    explained earlier that the two DASs up there had niches. We each had areas of
                    jurisdiction, but under Harry it didn't make a lot of difference. He didn't get
                    the wires crossed, I don't mean that. He knew what each of us was responsible
                    for. But for many of his activities he was very inclusive and very open. So even
                    though assignments came under my colleague, any time he had a meeting to discuss
                    the subject, I was invited. If we were going over ambassadorial candidates or
                    ambassadorial decisions, I was invited. It wasn't my primary responsibility, but
                    I was listened to and my advice was sought. And knowing that I came from an
                    administrative background and know most of the administrative officers, if he
                    had a problem in the administrative area, he'd turn to me. If he couldn't get an
                    administrative officer to go to New York, he'd turn to me and say “Find
                    one.”</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>Joan Clark. I had known her for a long time, I had worked for her. So we were
                    kind of open. But Joan is quite good. She is not very open and not very
                    inclusive. For example, I never sat in with Joan on any discussions of
                    ambassadorial candidates — almost never, although she turned to me in a few
                    specific cases. But if they were having a meeting to discuss which candidates to
                    recommend to the D Committee for next week, I wasn't there. And one of the
                    reasons, I think, was that Joan is not as open and not as inclusive as Harry
                    was. Also, Joan and my background's are more similar, and I think she may have
                    felt that she didn't need my skills, that she had them herself. Whereas Ron
                    Palmer and Andy Steigman were from political backgrounds she didn't have. But
                    she turned to me in a few cases, asked my advice, “Oh, do you know so and so,
                    what do you think about him.” But broad scope, no. She had a case once where the
                    committee had picked a candidate to be ambassador, and in the background
                    investigation something came up that they lost interest in him. They deemed this
                    candidate to be disqualified. So she came down and asked my advice. “What are we
                    going to do about this?” And I said, “You have no commitment. You can just be
                    de-select him if you want to do that. If the Under Secretary of Management says
                    I'm not going to go forward with this candidacy, just tell him, we're not going
                    to go forward with his candidacy. You have no obligation to him.” Or sometimes
                    if my colleague was out I would get into these issues, because we traded off for
                    each other. Or sometimes ambassadors would call me and I'd relay... So I was on
                    the fringes, but not in the core of that.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>In other ways, it's a little bit hard to separate the environment under Joan from
                    the new Administration. I told you earlier that a new Administration came in
                    January 21st, it was largely a distrustful attitude toward the bureaucracy in
                    general, including me as a Carter holdover. Am I to be trusted? So I was on
                    probation and I knew it. I was on my good behavior. So Joan, as the Director
                    General of that Administration may have felt some of that too. She may have felt
                    she was on probation too. So everybody was kind of careful. I think Joan may not
                    have been as expansive or sharing with me for that reason. Joan is very
                    cautious, she doesn't want leaks. And the way to prevent leaks is not to tell
                    anybody. So some things she didn't tell me because maybe in the early days she
                    thought it would get out. Based on a friend of mine's advice I went in and
                    knocked on her door within a month of her arrival. By then I had been in this
                    job a year and a half. I said, “Joan, do you want me to stay, or get out of your
                    way, pick your own deputy or whatever.” And she said “No, I want you to stay.”
                    The next year I did it again; I went by after two and a half years, “do you want
                    me to stay or look for another job?” “No, I want you to stay another year.” The
                    third time she said “Stay, and when I leave I'll get you a post. I'll put your
                    name forward for ambassadorship.” Okay. So, I stayed. And one day Joan went, and
                    I was still there. It came as a surprise. The Special Assistant to the Deputy
                    Secretary had called me and asked if Consular Affairs was a Presidential
                    appointment. Diego Asencio was in the job. I said, “Yes, it is.” He said, “Are
                    you sure it's one of those presidential appointment jobs?” And I said “Yes, it
                    is.” “Okay, thanks very much.” The next day, Joan was called up to see the
                    Deputy Secretary. She came back down, she called me in. I didn't tell her about
                    my call, there was no reason to tell her. She said “The Secretary wants me to be
                    Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs, and I told him if that's what you
                    want, that's what I'll be.” So she moved over to Consular Affairs and Roy
                    Atherton moved in. I learned later why, and I'll come back to Joan in a minute.
                    But Atherton had been Ambassador in Egypt and the Secretary, for domestic
                    reasons in Egypt, changes in policy I think, he wanted to change ambassadors,
                    but had a great respect for Roy Atherton and according to Atherton asked him
                    what he would like to do. And he said, “I'd like to be DG.” And the Secretary
                    said “You got it.” They came back, other wheels were turning, Diego Asencio
                    wanted to go to Brazil. Joan was a woman, they didn't want to kick her out, they
                    moved her over to Consular Affairs.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>Now Joan was not a shining DG. It gets a little bit back to this ambassadorship
                    thing, diplomacy and management. The DG job is a dual job too. In some ways its
                    a technocratic job. You need personnel expertise. The other one is a ceremonial
                    job, there's a lot of ceremonial stuff. Most of our DGs have been very good at
                    the ceremonial side but don't know a damn thing about the technocratic side.
                    Joan was very good on the technical side, and therefore she didn't need me as
                    much as say, a Harry, because much of the expertise I brought, she also had.
                    Joan was very good on the technocratic side, very good. She and I constantly
                    reinforced each other, so I suppose I was helpful. But she was awful on the
                    ceremonial side, her speeches and public appearances and public ceremonial was
                    mediocre at best. Everybody knew it, people grumbled to me “Why can't we get a
                    DG that can run a ceremony?” Secretary Shultz went out to Andrews Air Force base
                    to receive the body of some dead diplomat. And Joan's got to be there, the DG's
                    got to be there. And this wasn't a role she played very well. So I think some
                    people were happy to see her move on, even though they knew she was
                    professionally competent. Anyway, they moved her to CA, where I understand she
                    did a tremendous job.</p>
                <p>Now Roy Atherton came in under the circumstances I told you. He came in at almost
                    the same time that Ron Spiers came in as the new Under Secretary for Management.
                    And between them, they were going to be a new broom.</p>
                <p>Roy, I think both of them, but Roy had some preconceived ideas — we all do — that
                    I put in the nostalgia category. He did something that frightened us all. We
                    heard that in Egypt his wife Betty had an office in the Embassy, and also we
                    heard that he had a real shrew as a secretary. So here's Roy coming in and he
                    wants to bring this woman in as a secretary and Betty is in the office every
                    day, taking up my time and staff time. So we're a little concerned about the
                    role of the wife here. Overseas it's different, but here in the bureaucracy in
                    the Department and having a difficult secretary.... Both of those kind of died
                    away. We talked Roy out of bringing the secretary and I think after a couple of
                    weeks Ron Spiers spoke to Roy about Betty being in the office. I guess somebody
                    told him and he told Roy it really wasn't a good image.</p>
                <p>Now, the impression I got from them, you know I had just spent a year and a half
                    plus, two years under Joan Clark, implementing the Foreign Service Act. And some
                    people didn't like the way the Act was or the way it was implemented. And I'm
                    the wrong guy to undo all this stuff we just did. So I told Roy, even though
                    some of the implementation I may not have agreed with and I didn't always get my
                    way either, still, I'm not the guy to undo it all and I've now been here over
                    three and a half years on a two year tour, so I told Roy early on, get your own
                    executive, my time is up. I think he came in in January and I said I'd like to
                    leave in the summer. That gives you time to get somebody. Joan told me she would
                    propose me for a post; if you want to do that, fine; if you don't I'll look for
                    something myself. But let's plan that you bring in your own staff. He said okay,
                    and in the end I did get my post.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>But he envisioned the Foreign Service of the 1950s — they should be young people,
                    Master's Degrees, 23 years old, they should come to Washington, they should get
                    a dentist and a doctor and put them in their little black books so when they
                    come home on home leave they've got a dentist and a doctor and they've got roots
                    and they should buy a leather suitcase that'll last them 15 years and so on.
                    Kind of early 19th century idealized diplomatic service. But there are a lot of
                    things wrong with that image, and I sometimes told him what was wrong. I said
                    “Roy, first of all you have an illegal age discrimination.” Well, they were
                    outraged! Ron too! They were shocked that some of our FSOs coming in were in
                    their 40s, 50s even. We don't need that! We want 24 and 25 year olds for a
                    career. And I said “Age discrimination is illegal. The law says you can't do it.
                    “Well, what can we do?” I told them that there was something they could do that
                    would lower the recruitment age — lower the salary. Lower it from $25,000 to
                    $15,000 and you'll get young people. Thirty-year olds aren't going to come in
                    for that. But the young people will. Well, they didn't like that idea. But
                    there's no other way you can do it. And on this idealized notion of setting up a
                    home base in Washington, I said “These young folks do not want to set up
                    residency in Arlington. They don't want any of this stuff you're talking about.
                    They don't want to pay Virginia taxes for 30 years. They don't even want to get
                    license plates. In and out of here and avoid the tax liability.” So there were a
                    lot of little practical things. And times had changed. We had the civil rights
                    movement, we moved into the eighth decade of the 20th century, you can't go back
                    to the '50s, as attractive as it may have been for some purposes. But that was
                    kind of Roy's vision as I saw it, so I left shortly thereafter. He didn't stay
                    long either. He only stayed about a year. I'm sure he did a lot of good things
                    and meant well...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While I've got you trapped here talking about the DG, I
                        know at one time the idea of the Director General was somebody who would
                        stay on for a while, a senior diplomat, well respected, who also was not
                        going to get another job. It's always bothered me to have somebody having to
                        deal with this professional, non-career interface, and yet having to deal
                        with looking for another job at the same time. How did you feel about
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Well, there's a difference between the ideal model and the real
                    world, the hard cold world. Harry Barnes told me that Carol Laise, who had been
                    the DG before him, told him, “Harry, we should have an incumbent Director
                    General during the transition, so don't plan to leave with the Administration.
                    Either leave before and let them find somebody else before the transition, or
                    stay through the transition. Because it's an awful time to have a grass green
                    Director General and the institution suffers if you put it through that. So,
                    Harry told me “I'm going to stay.” He could have left before the election, that
                    year he could have gotten another post and gone. But he said he would stay a
                    year into the new administration. Well, he got fired on January 20! It doesn't
                    work. You can talk about it, but the world doesn't work that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Clint, let's talk about Guyana then. Obviously it was time
                        for you to move on and you were looking for a new job, and it was time to
                        get something both overseas and at the ambassadorial level. But how did the
                        system work in 1984?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I think I told you before that when Joan Clark left unexpectedly and
                    Roy Atherton came in as DG, Ron Spiers had come in as M, Under secretary for
                    Management, a little before that, and I had been in this Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary for Personnel about four years, and Joan had told me that at the
                    appropriate time she would put my name forward for an ambassadorship. She never
                    had, although she did ask me a couple of times. Once she kind of hinted about
                    Papua New Guinea. She asked me if I wanted to go. I didn't actually give her an
                    answer. I wasn't enthusiastic about it so I gave her an evasive answer and she
                    didn't raise it again. Then one day she came and asked me if I would take The
                    Gambia, and I said “No, it's just too small.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a river.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yeah, it's a river.</p>
                <p>Anyway, so I was never put forward. I guess those were a couple of opportunities.
                    I may also have told you before that Joan was completely different in processing
                    the ambassadorial appointments than Harry Barnes had been. Harry always had a
                    discussion with the three of us, the other DAS who at first was Bob Gershenson
                    and then Ron Palmer. He would have the two of us and usually I think the head of
                    FCA in a meeting and we would go over the posts and go over the people, and his
                    theory was that between the three or four of us, almost always one of us knew
                    the person, sometimes all of us knew the person! So we used to have a little
                    caucus. But Joan came in and that stopped, there was no such discussions. First
                    of all she knew people herself and second she was more closed. I didn't really
                    know in those days which candidates were going for what posts. I knew when
                    people were selected, because I got a list, but I never knew who the candidates
                    were. But then suddenly she got transferred out and I didn't have a post. She
                    had asked me at one point, a week or two before she left, she said, “Well, I
                    guess there's no post for you right now. Are you interested in going to Toronto
                    as CG?” I said, “Well, yes, but that takes me out of the running for an
                    ambassadorship.” She said: “No, not necessarily.” I said: “Okay then.” So after
                    she left I was paneled for Toronto to be CG, Consul General.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>I told Roy Atherton when he came in. He particularly and also Ron Spiers were
                    like a new broom, there were a lot of things about the Foreign Service Act of
                    1980 that they didn't like. There were some of the implementations of it they
                    didn't like. There were some I didn't like either. So they came in and kind of
                    wanted to start at ground zero and I had been there four years, and I thought,
                    I'm not the person. So I told Roy within a week or two that I'd like to move on.
                    Get your own deputy, do your own thing. I think this was in about February or
                    March, maybe I'll leave by the summer. Anyway, an opportunity came, I went on a
                    list upstairs to the D Committee, and I was picked as Ambassador to Malawi. I
                    don't think I was asked ahead of time. As far as I remember I was not. I went to
                    look it up and I said “Okay, fine,” and my name went to the White House and I'm
                    pretty sure it was approved. So I was doing my homework to go to Malawi. And one
                    day Ron Spiers called. He said “Clint, it's going to change. You want to go to
                    Guyana?” I said “I don't know. How soon do you need to know?” And he said,
                    “Right away.” I called my wife, to see if she'd go with me. I tried desperately
                    to find my wife but she had gone shopping and I couldn't find her. So I called
                    Bob Ryan. He was a DAS at ARA and he had been proposed for Guyana about nine
                    months before that, and got beat out by a politico. I figured he knew something
                    about Guyana so I called him and I said, “What do you think?” He said “Take it.
                    It's hardship but it's only five hours from Miami. So you've always got an
                    escape valve.” So a couple of hours later I called Ron Spiers back and said
                    “Okay, I'll take it.” He said: “Good, it's already arranged.” He then explained
                    that the White House had called and said that the political appointee that had
                    been picked for Guyana, kicking out Bob Ryan, had failed to get an agr�ment from
                    the host Government. He was a dentist from El Paso, who had been Chairman of the
                    Finance Committee of the Republican Party, and had previously been proposed for
                    Belize, and Belize had denied failed agr�ment. So they subsequently nominated
                    him to Guyana, instead of Bob Ryan, and Guyana said “Well, if he's not good
                    enough for Belize, he's not good enough for us.” So the White House called over
                    and said they wanted to send him - not to my country, Malawi, that would have
                    been too simple - they wanted to send him to Lesotho and send the candidate for
                    Lesotho to Malawi. And that left Lauderdale hanging loose and left Guyana
                    uncommitted. So Ron Spiers spoke right back and said why don't we send
                    Lauderdale to Guyana and just close the circle. And they said “Okay.” So then he
                    called me and I said okay. So that went forward.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just for the future historian. Do you know why the
                        candidate for Belize and Guyana had been turned down?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes. Belize had just gotten its independence. Before that we had had
                    an American Consul General there. He was very popular with the Belize government
                    officials. And they asked the U.S. government, why don't you make this guy the
                    ambassador. But the U.S. government, in its wisdom, selected a dentist from El
                    Paso who had not only no foreign affairs or diplomatic expertise or ever even
                    worked for the government before. He was just a dentist who was in local
                    political circles. So Belize said “We deserve better.” A newly independent and,
                    I suppose, sensitive country, and so they said no. Guyana then refused agr�ment
                    because Belize had done so. And there were articles in the press in Lesotho
                    which made the rounds in the State Department, an editorial which said, we're
                    over here little old Lesotho, you think we're a babe in the woods who doesn't
                    know what's going on, and we know that your candidate was turned down by two
                    other countries and you figure you can foist him off on us. But still, it
                    worked, they accepted him and he went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you're heading for the shores of Latin America and
                        all, how did you prepare for this, which was completely out of your
                        territory and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Well I had served two tours in Latin America, although this was
                    English speaking and is considered, even though it's on the continent, to be
                    Caribbean. In my four years as DAS for Personnel, I kept records on who was
                    picked for Ambassador. Not biographies, but categories. I wanted to do a little
                    research to find out who gets picked for ambassadorships and why. So I made a
                    chart and kept records for four years. I'll read you some of the categories I
                    created. After some experience, I put everybody in one of six categories,
                    although most candidates got more than one tick. Often candidates fell into
                    three categories. First of all I computed what I considered to be the
                    ambassadorial pool. My memory is that the pool was about 200 officers, which is
                    larger than one might think. But I put into the pool all former ambassadors, not
                    now serving in an ambassadorship; the number of ambassadors who reached the end
                    of their tour every year, which is another about 40; all Deputy Assistant
                    Secretaries; all career ministers if they weren't already counted. I considered
                    that to be the pool, and it was about 200. I also computed the opportunities,
                    and wrote a paper to Ron Spiers about the number of ambassadorial candidates in
                    the pool and the number of opportunities. We now have about 200 ambassadors, but
                    at the time we had about 140 ambassadors. Tours were two or three years. I added
                    them up and you come up with 50 or 60 ambassador appointments a year. When they
                    changed it to three-year tours, that lowered that considerably, down to about
                    40. Again I wrote Ron Spiers a paper on how many ambassadorships would come up
                    if you have a three-year tour and how many under the current system, how big the
                    pool is, and so forth. So in this pool, all the officers are qualified to be
                    ambassadors. So you've got a pre-screened, pre-qualified pool, and you have
                    let's say 200 officers and 40 opportunities, and my question was which 40 get
                    picked out of the 200 and why. We know the process but what I was charting were
                    their decisions. My categories were: water carrier, which I defined as usually a
                    Deputy Assistant Secretary, someone who carried the load for an Assistant
                    Secretary or Under Secretary, usually the principal deputy. All of these people
                    are major decision points in the Department, often acting on behalf of a
                    principal, but they all know each other, they're all high profile among the
                    Under Secretaries, so you could call them high profile people. I called them
                    “Water Carriers.” Another category I created was “Bureau favored.” By Bureau I
                    mean the regional bureau, the post is Guyana, who does the Assistant Secretary
                    of the Bureau or the principal deputy of the Bureau want. Whichever bureau
                    controls the post, who is the favorite of that bureau. Another category was
                    “Technocrat.” We don't have so many of those anymore, but in the days of
                    Communism, if you picked an ambassador to Poland or Czechoslovakia, they had to
                    be country or area political experts, Soviet specialists or China specialists.
                    If you sent a career officer to China, he was an old China hand or to Saudi
                    Arabia you had an Arabist. I called those “technocrats.” “Affirmative
                    Action.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Affirmative Action would be basically black or a
                        woman?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Or Hispanic. I created a category called “Promotion-Out” Somebody
                    that was in a job, in a way you might have considered me a “promotion out.” I'm
                    a Deputy Assistant Secretary, we've got a new DG, he wants to get his own DAS,
                    but he's got to find a way to get rid of me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about a double tick. You were a water
                        carrier and also they had to find a job for you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Right, so in that case, I conceivably could have gotten two ticks,
                    but I didn't call myself a promotion-out because I took the initiative. And then
                    the final category I had was “Insider.” An insider I defined as the college
                    roommate of Larry Eagleburger, or Ron Spiers' former DCM. People with special
                    inside connections. Now insiders, there weren't very many. In the four years I
                    was there we only had about a half dozen. And even fewer promotion-outs; two or
                    three, where they wanted to get this guy or woman out of the building.
                    Affirmative action, you know... So anyway, those were the categories I created.
                    The water carriers were by far the most numerous, and bureau favorites.
                    Technocrats were according to the number of countries, declining population.</p>
                <p>We had an off-site which PER hosted for Eagleburger, a conference out of town
                    over on the east shore, to get people away so they can concentrate, get to know
                    each other, and discuss things for 12 hours at a time without having telephone
                    calls. PER, me and Bill Baucus and Andy Steigman put this on for Ron Spiers and
                    Roy Atherton shortly after they had come, to brief them on PER. And also for
                    them to give us some policy guidance, their thinking, on all of these things.
                    Anyway, at this off-site, when we discussed this subject I told the group of my
                    record keeping, and Eagleburger asked me what the categories were. I remembered,
                    I read them off and gave a five-minute briefing, as I did here, and his
                    conclusion was: “Well I don't see anything wrong with that.” And I said, “I
                    didn't say there was anything wrong with it. I was just doing a little research
                    to find out what is happening and find out how the system works.” So that's how
                    I think ambassadors were chosen in those days. We had a couple of rules,
                    probably some even that I didn't know about. But one rule that I heard about was
                    no first-time ambassadors over age 57. Because when Roy Atherton came in, and I
                    sat in with him on the vetting of candidates again, the list came and it had a
                    candidate that was 59. And I told him of the rule. He didn't like the rule; he
                    said, “I was 59 when I was first appointed ambassador.” So they scratched that
                    rule.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard stories about people who were doing very well,
                        and very obviously on their way to becoming ambassadors, but either they
                        hadn't paid their income tax on time or there had been some impropriety,
                        nothing awful but enough to... visas given when maybe they shouldn't have
                        been given, or people who had squabbles with their staff and other positions
                        as far as efficiency reports go, or something like that. Did these things
                        play a role?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes. We had several cases. These all came out through the security
                    investigation process. As you know, candidates, after they are picked by the
                    committee then get a security update. And security sends the file, along with a
                    two-page summary, to the DG and Under Secretary for Management, and they decide
                    whether the nomination will go forward. And there were some cases where the
                    nomination, or the selection, was withdrawn. In one case, after the selection
                    was withdrawn, the candidate came to see the Director General, complained, the
                    DG said go take it up with Security. He got a Freedom of Information Act
                    request, went through his file, rebutted a lot of it, demanded that things be
                    removed from his file, some others he rebutted. In short, he sort of cleaned up
                    his file and it went back to the Under Secretary for Management for a decision.
                    Obviously the post that he had been selected for was gone, but he wanted a
                    decision as to whether he could be competed for another ambassadorship. I
                    considered it borderline, but the Under Secretary for Management said OK, he can
                    be competed again. And we put him on the list and he subsequently was accepted.
                    Some others were withdrawn and they resigned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When Guyana came up, how did you prepare yourself, how
                        does an ambassador prepare himself? And did you prepare any sort of an
                        agenda when you went out there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: In those days, I think it's true today, the Country Desk has a
                    checklist for new ambassadors. I suppose they did. I never saw it. But the Desk
                    Officer lined up a series of things and told me all the people I was supposed to
                    call up, read files obviously, you prepare for the Senate Hearing. In some cases
                    H gives you a mock hearing, in my case they didn't because they didn't think one
                    was necessary. Neither was I a candidate that was likely to get grilled, nor the
                    country... So there was a process of briefing and orientation and consultations
                    and interviews that I went through, all arranged or coordinated by the Desk
                    Officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What types of people were you seeing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Well, I went outside the building for some. Inside the building would
                    be the ones you normally expect. Now, for example, they all go see the Inspector
                    General. I didn't, in my day. But outside the building I went to the IDB,
                    Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank, AID, USIA, Department of
                    Agriculture about the PL 480 wheat program and some other things. Inside the
                    building I went to FBO, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you went through this, what did you see were
                        American...I mean, this is before you go, what in 1984 were American
                        interests and what were the things that you had to get your teeth into?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: That's very interesting because in those days the Ambassadorial
                    letter, the Secretary of State sends everybody a letter, they didn't have those
                    in those days, that tells them what the objectives are in their country. They
                    didn't have the goals and objectives either. It was one of those hiatuses when
                    they stopped it. But in those days... When I asked the Desk Officer what are the
                    goals and objectives in Guyana he said, “Well, you know, they are not in one
                    place, you read through the...” And I said, “Well I think we need some. I'll
                    write some up.” And he said “Oh no, don't do that.” “Why not?” “Well, they'd
                    have to get cleared and so on.” Anyway I did that. I made a little
                    back-of-the-envelope list. I thought the Senator might ask me. I made a list of
                    seven, and had them typed up and showed them to the desk officer and asked,
                    “Does that look ok?” And I think he edited one a little bit. So I had in my coat
                    pocket a list of seven.</p>
                <p>You asked where I went. One of the places I went was to the National Security
                    Council. And another place I went, after the Hearing, one of Jesse Helms aides
                    came up to me...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean the Jesse Helms who was a Republican Senator from
                        North Carolina who was very conservative and particularly had almost his own
                        foreign policy towards Latin America.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes. He was on the Foreign Relations Committee and was Chairman of
                    the Latin American Subcommittee. And he chaired my hearing. He chairs the
                    hearings of most ambassadors for Latin America. And after the Hearing one of his
                    aides came up and said “Senator Helms would like to meet with you privately. So
                    call over for an appointment.” So I did that, I made an appointment for a couple
                    of days later and went over. It so happens I didn't see him face to face because
                    he was tied up. But his aide took me in his office and told me what the Senator
                    wanted. He had a concern in Guyana about Russian airfields. Remember this was
                    after Grenada...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And we were very sensitive about messing around in those
                        countries, including, well, Guyana was a prime target at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I'm reverting back now to the hearing. Well, despite my good
                    preparation, at the hearing I was completely taken aback by his opening
                    question. After I gave my opening remarks and said I'd be pleased to answer any
                    questions, he said: “Mr. Lauderdale, how far is it from Guyana to Grenada?” And
                    I didn't know. I said; “I don't know. Maybe 300 miles, just a guess.” And he
                    said, “Yeah, 300 miles or so,” and I said, “Yeah, I think that's about right.”
                    And he said: “We took the airfield in Grenada. Are they building airfields in
                    Guyana?” I said “No.” And he said: “Are you sure?” I said “Yes, I'm sure,
                    they're not.” I had been to all the briefings. I had been to the CIA. And anyway
                    his aide called me and said “Senator Helms is interested in airfields in Guyana
                    and he thinks they may be enlarging some landing strips or building an
                    international landing strip. And he would like for you to write to him after you
                    get to post, write to him and tell him what you find out about it.” I said:
                    “Okay.” “And anytime you hear anything about airfields, you write regularly to
                    Senator Helms.” I said: “Okay.” And then I left. And when I went to the National
                    Security Council, they also asked me to write them a monthly newsletter on what
                    was going on in Guyana.</p>
                <p>Before I went to post, the last day or so I had an appointment with the Assistant
                    Secretary for Latin American Affairs, Elliott Abrams. No sorry, he came in
                    later. It was Tony Motley at that time. Tony Motley said: “Did you finish all
                    your consultations?” I said “Yeah.” “Did you go to the National Security
                    Council?” “Yeah.” He said: “Did they ask you to write them a letter?” “Yeah.”
                    “Are you going to?” I said, “No.” I told him about Jesse Helms too, and that I
                    wasn't going to write to him either. I said that what I will do, to honor my
                    commitment, if I give a report to the Department, letter or cable, that I think
                    they ought to know about, I will put it on there, “Please pass to Jesse Helms or
                    please pass to the NSC.” But I'm not going to blindside you guys. And he said:
                    “Good for you. Because I've got a guy out there who is doing that; he's a
                    political ambassador. So we have written him a letter saying “Don't do that, do
                    it through channels. And as a matter of fact we are now going to write a letter
                    to all ambassadors. So don't take offense, Clint, you're going to get the first
                    one. As a matter of fact, you write the first draft.” So we did that. My Desk
                    Officer and I wrote a draft of an ambassadorial letter, and it talks in general
                    terms, but we also put in there what the goals and objectives of the country are
                    and about the reporting channels, which was what the Assistant Secretary wanted.
                    He said just put in there what it is that we want to achieve in your country and
                    what your reporting channels are to do that. We wrote it up, and later I got the
                    letter addressed to me when I was ambassador, signed by Elliott Abrams. And he
                    also told me that they used the letter as a model for all the rest of Latin
                    America and that when he sent it up for the Secretary to sign, the Secretary
                    said “Oh, this is nice, why don't we do this for everybody?” So now we have the
                    ambassadorial letter. That's a long answer to your question.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it's particularly interesting because in 1984
                        we're still talking about relatively, the first part of the Reagan
                        administration and you had a rather divisive, nasty little war going on
                        within the administration, with Jesse Helms and his part of the Senate
                        almost carrying on their own foreign policy, highly suspicious of the State
                        Department. You had the National Security Council, which was also running
                        somewhat amok, and the State Department trying to reconcile, not to get into
                        an outright war, but this was a reflection of this particular period of
                        time. And Latin America was very much the focal point. There was something
                        called the Iran-Contra Affair that was coming out of this whole business. Am
                        I correct in characterizing this...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes, you're right. And at that time Guyana was friendly with Cuba,
                    friendly with the Soviets, with North Korea. It was on a kind of anti-U.S. kick,
                    it was kind of annoyed at the U.S. going all the way back to the time that the
                    CIA had intervened there. And they blamed a lot of their ills on us. So it was
                    not unreasonable for Senator Helms to think that they might let an airfield be
                    constructed there, a la Grenada. It wasn't true, but it wasn't unreasonable to
                    suspect it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Clint, also, the Grenada business, which maybe, I think,
                        because this is going to come up, you might describe just a little for
                        somebody who might not be aware of what Grenada was. And also Suriname had
                        turned pretty sour during this period too, so it looked like we were
                        developing sort of a communist boil in the shoulder of Latin America
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes. Well, Grenada is one of the islands in the Caribbean, and as I
                    said earlier, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guyana are considered a part of the
                    Caribbean, even though they are on the coast of the mainland, because they were
                    settled by European, non- Spanish European, and they had more in common with
                    Caribbean countries than they do with the Spanish speaking mainland, because the
                    three are French, Dutch, and English.</p>
                <p>Anyway, as a result of a coup that had occurred there, Grenada came under the
                    control, dictatorship one might say, of a leftist, pro-Marxist prime minister,
                    at least temporarily, whose legitimacy wasn't all that solid. But he was in
                    control and ran the country. He permitted Cuban technicians to come in to
                    enlarge and extend the airport to take 747s, large tourist aircraft, under the
                    guise that Grenada could become a tourist mecca, as many other Caribbean islands
                    had. But they needed a good airfield. Of course the fact that they didn't have
                    the hotels in those days is another matter. Well, this airfield would also
                    accommodate fighter aircraft and fighter bombers and so forth, so the U.S.
                    became concerned about the presence on an island in that location that could
                    accept Soviet or Cuban-based MiGs or other military aircraft and questioned the
                    economic need for it. So their intelligence and other information led them to
                    believe that, while the country was under the control of a Marxist, this
                    presented a threat to the United States. So eventually we invaded Grenada threw
                    out the Marxist prime minister who ruled by the gun, and restored the country to
                    democracy. And so of course then the democrats kicked the Cubans out, and the
                    U.S. finished construction of the airfield.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But we're still talking about a very sensitive time when
                        you went to Guyana. I guess maybe we'd better talk about how you saw the
                        history of Guyana before you got there, as an American-Guyanese...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Well Guyana was kind of tricky. It was historically under the
                    colonialship at various times of France, Britain, Holland. The Dutch came first,
                    the French kicked them out. Then the British kicked out the French or got it in
                    one of the European trades. It was a sugar plantation initially, and when they
                    got their independence in 1966, about the time Trinidad and many Caribbean
                    nations got their independence, it was a black country, the population was
                    largely black, except for the planters. But after the abolition of slavery in
                    the British Empire in 1834, and the blacks refused to work in the sugar
                    plantations, they imported indentured servants from India, and some from Ceylon,
                    I think, and also from Portugal and a few from China. So the population is about
                    40% black, maybe 45% or so Indo-Guyanese, and then a few percent Chinese,
                    Portuguese. European was under 1%.</p>
                <p>When they had their first election Cheddi Jagan, who was an avowed Marxist and
                    his wife, who was an American and also an avowed Marxist—and his party, the PPP
                    was a Communist Party, won. Of course the Indians were the majority and his
                    party won, and his party was Communist and he was a Communist and that made
                    Churchill and the U.S. kind of nervous. So the U.S. — this is now public,
                    according to the Freedom of Information Act it's time to release this
                    information but the State Department doesn't want to do it — but according to
                    the stories at that time the CIA funneled money and other efforts to get the
                    Communists out of office, and at the next election Forbes Burnham was elected.
                    He was a black, with the non-Communist Party. So he was president when I was
                    there, and had been president, almost 20 years, ever since independence,
                    well-ensconced, black, representing a minority party. And the opposition party
                    was Communist. So it was nice to talk about free elections and all that stuff,
                    but if they were free, the Communists would probably come into power. And I'd
                    probably be relieved as Ambassador!</p>
                <p>Forbes Burnham was an odd kind of fellow. He was kind of sneaky and manipulative,
                    very political and kind of postured as anti-U.S., but he transmitted signals
                    that he wasn't all that anti-U.S., that this was just posturing. He told me
                    once, for example: “Mr. Lauderdale, do not forget when you evaluate my regime
                    that my opposition is the Communists. I don't have any opposition on the right.
                    So if I want to stay in office I have to constantly usurp the left.” That's all
                    he said, but it was useful for me to know that.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>So we had one election while I was there. There was some fraud. There have always
                    been allegations of fraud. My report to the Department was that some fraud
                    occurred but probably not enough to have altered the outcome of the election.
                    They would not permit international observers at that time. Since then they had
                    international observers, they had a fully free and fair election, and Cheddi
                    Jagan won. Of course the Berlin Wall came down in the meantime, so nobody gets
                    high blood pressure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nobody gives a damn, really.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: But in those days they did! When the Wall was there, the Iron Curtain
                    was there, if the Communists had won in Guyana the U.S. would have been
                    restive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you arrived when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I arrived in '84. The Ambassador's post had been vacant almost a year
                    because it had failed agr�ment twice. I changed the tone. The previous
                    ambassador, who was a black, retired admiral, had kind of played hard line with
                    the local regime. The relationship was strained. And I decided to go the other
                    way. I was not going to lecture them, I was not going to cause grief. I was
                    going to try to establish friendly relations. So that's what I did, and I think
                    it worked. There were groups that wanted me to give speeches and rail against
                    fraudulent elections or dictatorship or high-handed actions by the government,
                    but I wouldn't do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about ambassadors. You had one of these
                        policies where the United States was...there were a lot of pressures,
                        particularly on the Latin American connection, to be more rightist, you
                        might say, than in other areas. I mean, were you getting any signals that
                        you were supposed to posture more than you felt you should? Or were you kind
                        of left alone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: No. I was kind of left alone. I didn't really get any instructions in
                    the years I was down there, other than from USUN about the vote in the U.N. and
                    some kind of worldwide stuff. I didn't get anything specific to Guyana. When I
                    was in Washington for consultations the word I got was more or less “keep up the
                    good work.” So I didn't get any of that, and what I did do was establish good
                    personal relationships with everybody, except Forbes Burnham. You couldn't
                    establish a good personal relationship with him. And he didn't even see me for
                    about four or five months. His vice-president accepted my credentials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this deliberate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes, I am convinced it had to be deliberate. I found in the files
                    that a previous ambassador had wanted to see Forbes Burnham and asked for an
                    appointment and nothing happened. And then one day, the day before he was
                    leaving to go to the United States, he got a phone call, and they said “The
                    president would like to see you tomorrow.” And he said “Oh geez, I'm going to
                    the United States tomorrow. I'm catching a plane at 7:40 and I'll be gone three
                    days. But I can see him as soon as I get back.” And they said, “No, thank you
                    very much.” So I read that and I wasn't sure if it was deliberate. The
                    implication was that this was deliberate. And the same thing happened to me. You
                    know when we are going to leave we have to notify the foreign minister. I
                    notified the foreign minister's office that I was going to the United States, I
                    was going a certain time, returning a certain time. And I got a call for an
                    appointment with Forbes Burnham. So I just changed my flight schedule. It wasn't
                    anything that couldn't be changed, so I just changed it and I didn't say a damn
                    word. But I think it was deliberate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a little about the Embassy. Here you had a DCM
                        who I guess had been charge for about a year or so. How did you...this
                        sometimes is a difficult relationship, because somebody has been running the
                        show for a year, and even though you're both professionals, somebody else
                        appears — that's a little difficult. How did this work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Well, a lot of strange things happened. He left a week before I got
                    there. That was David Beale. He is now DCM in Brazil, I think, somewhere down
                    there, Mexico maybe. I wanted him to stay, but it didn't work out. I delayed my
                    own arrival, by the way, because in my consultations one of the things I asked
                    for was an appointment with the President and a photo-op. For the piano, you
                    know. And it didn't come. In the meantime I went around about my own business,
                    and I was going to get there in the middle of June in order to host the 4th of
                    July. We had ordered napkins and hot dogs and all that stuff. Well, about three
                    or four days before I was scheduled to leave — and then I would have overlapped
                    with the DCM for a couple of weeks — the White House called over and said “You
                    have an appointment on Wednesday.” And I said, “Well, I was leaving for country
                    on Tuesday. But I'll tell you what, it's the President of the United States,
                    I'll change my plans.” So I called the post and said I had to delay my departure
                    by about ten days. I don't want to arrive on July 2. So I'm going to push it
                    past July 4. I'll come about the 10th or something, you guys go ahead and have
                    your 4th of July or whatever. The DCM left about the 6th. So my new DCM arrived
                    a day or two before I did.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Embassy? What was the staffing like
                        and what was your impression? You're an old hand now, you've been around.
                        How did you feel about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I thought the staffing was pretty good. I was more upset and
                    concerned about the physical facilities. This is already a hardship post, but in
                    this hardship post the office is a firetrap and a fleabag, and the residence is
                    old, a 100-year old wooden colonial house and the air conditioning goes clank,
                    clank, clank at night. So the staff of Americans and FSNs, I liked the American
                    staff just fine, we got on just fine and didn't have any real strains. I had
                    decided given the circumstances in this country, even though I had served in a
                    lot of high-profile, hectic environments, that this was not the place to crank
                    things up and create a boiler room and all of that. I said, this is a low
                    profile kind of take it easy post. So I did that. I didn't demand the cables at
                    7:30 in the morning, I didn't keep my secretary and the communicator til late at
                    night. We were in the same time zone as Washington, and I told the Political
                    Officer when he rushed in with his 5:00 cable that we'd send it out tomorrow, at
                    10:00. And that worked. The communicator went home, in fact I deliberately
                    didn't go to the office for about 30 minutes after office hours so that my
                    secretary could open up, get the cables and have them for me, without having to
                    come in early. And I did the same thing in the afternoon. She's supposed to go
                    home at 5:00, I tried to get out at quarter to five so she wouldn't have to work
                    overtime. And the communicator was supposed to be out by 5:30. Most of the time
                    that's the way it worked, unless we had an election or a little flap, which
                    wasn't often, maybe once a quarter something would come up. But mostly, day to
                    day, it would work just the way you talked about. So I tried to...I emphasized
                    morale and baseball games on Saturday and stuff like that, and I think it worked
                    well.</p>

                        still hanging around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: It wasn't so much hanging around. it was something people talked
                    about, particularly people outside Guyana, in the United States if I told
                    somebody I was Ambassador to Guyana they'd say “Oh, Jonestown.” But in Guyana it
                    wasn't talked about very much. It was, you know, passe. There were still some
                    goings on, we got a visit fairly regularly, either from the FBI or from the
                    Justice Department, there were still some prosecutions going on in Los Angeles.
                    So a lawyer, an investigator, or a prosecutor would come down occasionally to
                    interview witnesses or follow up in some way. Or in a few cases we contacted
                    witnesses and got them on the plane to Los Angeles, but that's really about all.
                    I went out and inspected the site, so many people asked me about it I thought I
                    should see what it was like, but it was just covered with weeds, there wasn't
                    much there.</p>

                        left that they weren't in the pocket of the United States more than anything
                        else? Not spite, but just to show that they didn't get along with the United
                        States. Or was this a personality thing of whoever was their ambassador at
                        the U.N. or the foreign minister?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: No, I think it was two other things. One, they were a poor country.
                    They wanted and needed foreign aid, and they sought it where they could get it.
                    They got it from the Soviet Union, they got some from East Germany, North Korea,
                    all kind of poor countries, but still those countries helped Guyana. So
                    association with the “outs” so to speak, bore them some fruit. And they
                    cultivated those. Their instructions to their ambassadors, I happen to know, was
                    that they should garner more foreign aid than it cost to run their missions.
                    That was kind of the minimum. If you didn't do that, we're going to bring you
                    home. But hopefully in the hundreds of thousands, maybe the millions, send
                    tractors, send trucks, whatever you can get. And they did a lot of barter trade,
                    so they didn't earn enough dollars. Their principal export was sugar and rice,
                    and they had a U.S. sugar quota, which was their mainstay, really, but they kept
                    the U.S. at arms length in order to get aid from other countries. On the other
                    hand, the United States stopped aid. We closed the AID mission during my time,
                    and got an editorial that kind of said “Good riddance.” I went over and
                    protested to the foreign minister about it and asked for a retraction, but he
                    told me, he called me three days later and said “No, we're not going to retract
                    it. We didn't dictate it but we're not going to retract it either.” So I said,
                    “well, you may want it back one day and you may regret that editorial.” And he
                    said, “Well, that's how it is.” So I think it was... they got aid from Cuba,
                    they were friendly to Cuba, because I think they thought that's where their
                    bread was buttered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of aid had we been giving and why did we shut it
                        down? I mean, was this on your watch or had this been made before?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: The decision had been made before I went. There's an amendment, I've
                    forgotten the name of it, to the Foreign Assistance Act that says that aid will
                    be cut off to any countries that is in arrears in their payment by a certain
                    amount. Guyana was in arrears and they triggered that statute that they couldn't
                    get more aid because they were in arrears in their payment for prior aid. As to
                    what kind of AID, it wasn't a big program, maybe four million a year in the
                    areas of public health, public transportation. We built health clinics, mostly
                    for the Indians; we built some highways, which are expensive, as you know. We
                    had an agricultural project, we did experiments and research on rice seeds and
                    gave Guyana some improved grains of rice. So it was agriculture, transportation,
                    and public health, as I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about relations with the Cubans. Was this something we
                        were watching with concern at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes. We were concerned about their relations with Cuba. There was a
                    Cuban ambassador there, whom I was not allowed to talk to, by the way, so at
                    diplomatic functions where we were all present I always made sure I sat at
                    opposite ends of the table. Although once I got trapped next to him and we
                    exchanged a few pleasantries, that's all. He wasn't a very gregarious or
                    friendly or likeable person anyway, so it was pretty easy to avoid him. Yes, we
                    were suspicious of the relationships with Cuba. As you know Cuba had for years
                    fomented revolution in Latin America, so we were watching them pretty
                    carefully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was it an over-riding concern that Jagan, the
                        Communist, Marxist Party was going to take over by fair means or foul? Was
                        that something you were watching?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: It wasn't so much we were concerned about Jagan. It wasn't so much
                    that we were concerned internally either. What we were concerned about was the
                    international aspect; that there would be some treaty of alliance or mutual
                    assistance with East Germany, the Soviet Union, the North Koreans, or worst of
                    all, Cuba. That they would set up some bases or have a base of operations. So
                    that was our primary concern, to keep the Communist powers from having another
                    stronghold in the Caribbean area. Now theoretically if Jagan and his Communist
                    Party came to office that threat would be increased. But in fact it happened
                    even under Forbes Burnham, so I didn't see any increased threat by the election
                    of Jagan per se, but, except the public relations aspect, the publicity it would
                    get in the United States, that you've got another communist country, that's
                    semi-communist now, in the sense that they are friendly with all these and cater
                    to these other communist powers. But it would have been more public,
                    high-profile, and would have caused a little bit more trouble.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any relations with Jagan?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yeah. I called on him and invited him to my residence and so forth. I
                    didn't mix him. When I had government or diplomatic officials or so forth I
                    usually didn't invite him. But occasions like the 4th of July, or if it was a
                    larger group or a reception...Secretary Elliott Abrams came down during my time.
                    Burnham died, and Abrams came down for the funeral, so on occasions like that I
                    would have Cheddi Jagan over. I tried to talk to him, but I found out we
                    couldn't talk unless we talked about...[tape cut off]... I talked to him a few
                    times, and I knew his sister quite well and I had a lot more contact with her.
                    She was the wife of a Guyanese businessman whom we liked and associated with
                    quite regularly, and I asked her about her brother. But I figured I had to talk
                    to him once or twice, just to make sure. But what I found was that he was
                    ideologically a Marxist, and you can argue or discuss till you're blue in the
                    face but you're not going to change anything, so I didn't try. Q: How about his
                    wife, was she still an American citizen?</p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yeah, I think she maintained her citizenship. And she also was
                    ideologically a Marxist. So I'm not going to talk to these folks about Communism
                    or democracy, it's useless. So we talked about Guyana, or New York, or Florida,
                    or the Caribbean or other things when we socialized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about American business in the area. Was there much
                        American business presence there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: All of the American expatriate business people had gone by the time I
                    came. The economy had soured so bad, Citibank closed its office, Barclay's Bank
                    closed its office. Some of the bigger industries there, like the bauxite and the
                    sugar industries had been nationalized before. The bauxite was American and the
                    Sugar was British. They had both been nationalized. There were no American
                    expatriate citizens. There was one. he was the manager of the flour mill, which
                    was U.S. owned. There were some other American companies, but they were run by
                    Guyanese. I went to the Chamber of Commerce meetings and so forth and there were
                    some American investments and interests, but no Americans. There was one other,
                    it wasn't in Guyana it was up in the Bauxite mines, I think it was, Green
                    Construction. They did the bauxite mining and there were 27 Americans up there.
                    We used to go up and play a little baseball game.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the, I mean, the, we were very much involved in
                        a war, guerrilla war and all in Nicaragua and El Salvador. Did that play at
                        all in Guyana? Did you find yourself having to explain it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes, yes, because Guyana's position on that was very similar to
                    Mexico's. Guyana thought we were off-base in our fear for Nicaragua. They were
                    themselves friendly toward Nicaragua. Yes, that's something we gave them
                    information on. Among other things, votes would come up in the U.N., you know at
                    one time we mined the harbor in Nicaragua, and Guyana, you know, its the usual
                    outrage along with the rest of the Marxist-Leninist world. I was not able to
                    convince them, mostly, however. They just had a different perspective on it.
                    Some Americans did too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the press?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: There were two newspapers. One was the Party, the Guyana Chronicle
                    was actually put out by Burnham's Party, the PNC. The Catholic Church had a
                    little flyer that was the only thing that approached an independent newspaper,
                    that we all waited for weekly, it was about four pages. During my tenure I
                    helped get started an independent newspaper. There were people there that wanted
                    to run an independent newspaper, but they needed grants and loans and they
                    needed a press and paper. You couldn't get paper in Guyana and you had to have
                    dollars to buy it. So they got a grant from the organization that was set up by
                    the Congress, I've forgotten what it's called now, there's one set up by the
                    Democratic Party and one by the Republicans. They give grants. So they got a
                    grant of I think $50,000 and probably a printing press, and for the last year
                    and a half that I was in Guyana we had an independent newspaper and that helped
                    quite a bit. And also television came. Somebody set up a local television
                    station, pulled it down off the satellite and rebroadcast it. Theoretically
                    you're supposed to pay a royalty on that, and countries do pay royalties to the
                    networks. But Guyana was so poor that they either waived it or didn't care.
                    So... most of this was after Burnham died and Desmond Hoyt, who had been vice
                    president, became the president. He was more tolerant of a lot of this
                    stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened when Burnham died, how did this impact and
                        how did you see it at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Burnham died prematurely because of his ideological convictions and
                    posturing. He was kind of a victim of his own style. He had some problem with
                    his vocal chords, and they needed to be scraped or whatever. It's not a
                    procedure I'm familiar with. But he had postured so much, and he was too proud
                    to go to the United States for medical treatment. In the past he had usually
                    gone to Britain. But his advisers convinced him that he should do it in Guyana,
                    and they had Cuban-trained doctors in Guyana. Most of the Guyanese who wanted to
                    become doctors, they'd send them off to Cuba to medical school. And also in the
                    past he had on occasion gone to Cuba for medical treatment. But in this case,
                    they brought two Cuban doctors to Guyana and the operation was to occur in the
                    Guyana Hospital. The significance is that it requires full anesthesia. I had
                    been in a Guyana hospital once overnight — you wouldn't want to be in a Guyana
                    hospital. Anyway, he didn't survive. He never came out of anesthesia. They
                    didn't really have the right equipment, or the equipment they had didn't work.
                    So he died as a result of that, which would have been a minor procedure, except
                    for the full anesthesia, in any American or British hospital.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did this cause much change?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yeah, quite a bit. Desmond Hoyt, who was much more moderate, much
                    more reasonable, became president. He an I had been friendlier, as I said I
                    couldn't really be friendly with Forbes Burnham, but Hoyt had always been
                    friendly with me from the beginning, from my first call. Of course he was
                    circumspect, he wasn't going to embrace me or anything like that. But he would
                    send signals that he appreciated what I was doing and that he wanted to continue
                    to work with me. Now he was president. He reversed some of the Burnham policies
                    — he authorized the importation of flour, the re-opening of the flour mill the
                    reimportation of wheat, I should say, through the PL 480 Program, and I went to
                    see him to talk about that. He changed some of the cabinet members, he let the
                    new newspaper open up, because the previous administration wouldn't give them a
                    permit for importing newsprint. He let the TV station start, so more
                    communications, more access to information occurred.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This, of course, is an unclassified interview, but it's a
                        question I often ask. How did you find your relations with the CIA. I would
                        think this would be an area where you might be stepping on each others'
                        toes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Well, there may be things I don't know, I have to acknowledge that
                    even though I was the ambassador, but as far as I know, things were very good.
                    They told me everything they were doing, in some cases they needed my approval,
                    in some cases they probably didn't. When I thought it was reasonable, I gave
                    approval. I personally liked the station chief and most of the staff. A couple
                    of them I thought were kooky. But the relationship was on the whole harmonious
                    and fruitful.</p>

                        sort of passe by this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: No. I did several things. One, I asked to be briefed by the CIA. I
                    had had a briefing before the Senate hearing, and they have some satellite
                    pictures and they take some. Now I don't know how extensive it was, I didn't ask
                    for any special satellite sweeps or any of that stuff. Maybe Senator Helms did.
                    But they told me that as far as they knew there were no airfields being
                    constructed. As far as they knew.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's pretty hard in that kind of area to come up with some
                        secret field.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yeah, although Guyana's pretty big. On the other hand, to build an
                    airfield you have to have bulldozers and equipment and gasoline, and there were
                    no roads, you'd have to fly in the gasoline, and that couldn't have happened
                    without my knowing it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: What we did find was that except for the highway up to Linden...
                    Guyana had three highways, one along the coast, one up to the bauxite mines at
                    Linden, and one out to the airport. Beyond that there are no paved roads. On the
                    other hand, it's a big country and communication and transportation within the
                    country are by river and by air. So they have a lot of small, one and two-engine
                    airplanes, and that's how they deal with the interior. So there are quite a few
                    little landing strips around Guyana, and often they wanted to improve them,
                    enlarge them, and in a couple of cases that's what they were doing. Upgrading
                    the quality of a little landing strip, maybe putting gravel on it, or if it has
                    gravel maybe cementing it or something. I found a couple of places where that's
                    what they were doing. And I flew out to Jonestown and we landed on a little
                    landing strip. It's hard ground with a little gravel on top. And I had been to
                    some others. So I had a sense of what these little landing strips looked like
                    and in a few places I found out that the government was trying to upgrade them a
                    little bit, and I think that's all it was.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you get around, sort of in the outback or
                        whatever you call it?</hi>

                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Some, but not as much as others. The Canadian Ambassador was more
                    adventurous. He went into the backwoods and the wilds, and his canoe turned over
                    in the river and he got wet and lost his $200 hunting rifle, and he slept in
                    tents and was eaten by mosquitoes. I didn't do that. I wasn't interested in
                    that. We went up to lumber mills when the businessman that owned it invited us
                    for a boat ride up the river to the landing mill, have lunch with us and come
                    back. So we did some of that but we didn't do any of the real roughing it into
                    the interior.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any fleet visits from the Soviet or American
                        navies that sort of stuck in your mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: No. There was a threatened fleet visit by a U.S. ship a couple of
                    times, but there was nothing significant that I can remember either from the
                    Soviets or American.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about official visits?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: No, you don't get many of those down there. Elliott Abrams came down
                    for the funeral with an entourage of four people. Otherwise, our visitors were
                    all working level — like the desk officer, country management level, telephone
                    technician. We got significant numbers of visitors, but I don't think I got
                    anybody of senior rank except for Elliott Abrams and his entourage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it was a relatively... it was a working period, but
                        with no great upsets, except having the head of state die...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: That, and the election was during my time. They have them every five
                    years. Those were the high points.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about the election? How was it run?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Well, we monitored it and participated in election activities. I
                    thought there was some... I didn't cable the State Department my opinion for two
                    or three days because I wanted some more... but more and more congratulations
                    came in from the British and the French, and everybody had congratulated Forbes
                    Burnham on his election except the United States. But I was trying to get more
                    reports, interview more people. I went to see the bishop. There was a time when
                    they were raking the bishop over the coals because he was a democrat and he
                    would speak out. Once when he spoke out and they had a nasty editorial in the
                    paper about him, I made a point to go see him the next day.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>I would call and have a cup of coffee and so forth and give him encouragement,
                    which he seemed to appreciate. Of course I had the big black cadillac, so
                    everyone would know of my visit. So I did things like that, I interviewed as
                    many people as I could, that I thought were objective. I didn't endorse Cheddi
                    Jagan.... Based on my conversations with people, our conclusion was that there
                    was some cheating, some irregularities but it wasn't massive and it didn't
                    affect the outcome. So that's what I told the State Department and suggested
                    that they congratulate Forbes Burnham on his election. And they even used the
                    language I sent, that there were some irregularities, some evidence of fraud but
                    they didn't seem to be so massive or grand in scope that they determined the
                    outcome of the election. Whether that was true or not I really don't know.</p>

                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: In June 1987. FBO was going to build a new Chancery in the compound
                    of the residence, so a new residence would be needed. I sent a cable to FBO
                    saying I would not approve the new Chancery until they developed a plan for a
                    new residence. I got a cable back that said “Well, we don't know, but maybe the
                    Ambassador could take the DCM's residence”, because they looked in their little
                    book and saw that we owned a DCM house. And I cabled back that the DCM house is
                    hardly adequate for the DCM. As a matter of fact the DCM thinks he needs a
                    better house, but I said, well you've got to wait, we've got to take care of the
                    ambassador's residence first. So that is not a solution. So I finally got a
                    commitment out of them that they would build an ambassador's residence. Not in
                    my time, of course. So then progress went forward and I was supposed to move out
                    of the residence in March so they could start construction on the site, and my
                    tour was up in June. So where was I going to move in March? We didn't have a
                    house. We scouted the market and we couldn't find one. The GSO, the Admin.
                    officer did the screening and every time we thought he'd found one I'd go look.
                    We didn't have a place for me to live, and construction and all that, a
                    permanent facility is going to be two years away. So finally I wrote to the DG
                    and the Assistant Secretary and said my time is up in June, but I'm going to be
                    evicted from my house in March with no real place to live and really, I don't
                    want to move. So why don't I tell you folks right now that I'd like to come out
                    in March — I did this in September — and you can put my job on the list and get
                    a new ambassador. I got a letter back from both of them kind of lamenting,
                    saying that's too bad, and saying gee we'd really like for you to stay til June,
                    but even though this was September, we've already picked an ambassador, she's in
                    the senior seminar and doesn't graduate until June, so will you stay til June.
                    So I said okay, I'll stay til June. Then, come March, it turned out FBO wasn't
                    ready and I got to stay in the house right up til June. Of course the new
                    ambassador was mad because she didn't have anywhere to live. So I said “Look, go
                    talk to FBO.” And then FBO was not going to let her move into the house at all,
                    so I interceded. Because by then construction had been deferred until August. I
                    said, let her move into the house, let her have her welcome reception, it proved
                    very handy for me. She needs to have her reception to meet everybody and
                    probably give a party for the staff. She can do that in the first couple of
                    months and then she can move to a hotel until she finds another place. So they
                    finally relented and that's what happened. She moved into the residence, and I
                    think in the meantime found a temporary residence. It was not adequate, by the
                    way. It was a one bedroom house. It had a nice representational area but only
                    one bedroom, which would not have been adequate for me, and she lived there, I
                    think, for most of her tour. And they never did build the house. I think
                    subsequently they may have found something more suitable and more permanent. I
                    think they arranged with somebody else to build one for us that we would than
                    rent or something like that. So it was finally solved about five years
                    later.</p>

                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes. The DG called me. I was impressed that George Vest called me
                    personally, you know how it is, small-time ambassador. He said that Ron Spiers
                    wanted me to do a project for him for the summer, and then in August would I
                    become a senior inspector, team leader? I said, “Are the two linked.” He said
                    “No, not necessarily.” I said, “I'll take the project. I'd prefer to go overseas
                    or do something different, but I'll let you know.” In due course I took both, I
                    did the project and then I reported on Labor Day to OIG, just at the time there
                    was a big OIG upheaval. Harrop left and his organization was abolished and
                    incorporated into a larger OIG under Sherman Funk. So Sherman Funk reported on
                    duty in August, I reported on duty in August, as a part of the inspection staff
                    that he had just absorbed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what was your special project before you came into

                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Foreign Service mail system. Ron had been getting a lot of complaints
                    about the Foreign Service mail system and asked me if I'd do a study of it. And
                    I said yes, and I wrote him a report with 11 recommendations, all of which he
                    accepted and ordered implemented.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the inspection system. You were there at
                        the time of a great upheaval. Could you explain what happened to the
                        inspection system?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes. State Department had had an office of Inspector General for a
                    long time, I think since 1906. Many of the other agencies, a few now are
                    creating offices of inspection, but most other agencies don't have an office of
                    inspection. Some of them might not need them. You need an inspection system
                    especially for the Foreign Service, and from 1906 up to the 1970s, it was under
                    the Inspector General of the Foreign Service, and they inspected the Foreign
                    Service only, I stress only. And it is critical for the Foreign Service. But in
                    the '70s they found that they could not solve all the problems of the Foreign
                    Service that they encountered without dealing with the bureaucracy back home, so
                    they started inspecting domestic bureaus as well. Now in the meantime, in 1986
                    Congress passed, actually it was earlier, in the late '70s, Congress passed an
                    OIG Act, that required every major agency of the government to establish an
                    office of the inspector general with an office of audits and an office of
                    investigations. State got itself exempted from that law on the basis that “We're
                    different, we already have an Inspector General, etc. etc.” So State continued
                    kind of on its own. But that provided a source of constant frustration to the
                    rest of the government. When they had meeting of inspectors general, State
                    wasn't there. Or if they were there, they didn't fit, etc. etc. Reports to make,
                    forms to fill out, and we don't follow the format. There were also some
                    substantive reasons too. Again, Senator Jesse Helms and other felt that Foreign
                    Service inspecting the Foreign Service was the Old-Boys inspecting the Old Boys,
                    and that ain't good enough, that these inspectors should be civil servants and
                    they should be outside the network. So in '86, Congress amended the OIG Act to
                    incorporate State, and they included a provision in the amendment that the
                    Inspector General can no longer be a Foreign Service Officer. So they cast the
                    net and came up with Sherman Funk. Harrop's tour was over anyway. State had
                    already created an office of Inspector General with Audits and Investigations,
                    but Harrop's inspection corps remained separate. So after Sherman Funk was
                    selected, negotiations were entered into with Harrop and his deputy to
                    incorporate this Office of Inspections under the new OIG. And that happened, and
                    that's the same time that I was reporting for duty. Sherman Funk brought with
                    him all of his front office staff, from elsewhere, Commerce mostly, he came from
                    Commerce. His secretary and his aide and his lawyers and his investigative staff
                    came from other agencies, outside State. And he built up the audit staff, which
                    had been 10, to 90, and the investigative staff, which had been three or four,
                    to 50. All civil servants, mostly outsiders. And then the Office of Inspections,
                    which was almost exclusively Foreign Service, was incorporated in that. So there
                    was a certain degree of cultural shock all around, internally and externally.
                    Internally there was a lot of, there were attitudes by these new groups, from
                    Sherman on down, that inspections protects the Foreign Service, that there are a
                    lot of crooks and thieves that don't get prosecuted because the inspectors
                    shield them, and we're going to ferret them out and all this stuff. So there was
                    considerable strain.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you received in all this, I mean you're part of
                        the old-boy network?</hi>

                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I was viewed as Mister Foreign Service, not to be trusted.
                    Eventually, two things happened over the five years that I was in OIG. One was
                    that I convinced them of my talent, I think, and bona fides, and two was that
                    they became a little bit more acculturated, so a lot of that has been toned
                    done, dissipated now, but not all of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I must say that sometimes when I go back to the
                        Foreign Service, where people are getting shot at, going through
                        earthquakes, malaria, a lot of very difficult things, the big signs on the
                        walls seem to be “Waste, Fraud, Mismanagement.” If you look at what is
                        displayed on the walls, that seems to be the main purpose, which is not very
                        inspiring. I mean... how did you feel about this organization? Were these
                        people out to get people? If you've got so many investigators, you've got to
                        have raw meat to throw to them all of the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Well, if you recall back in the 1980 election, one of Ronald reagan's
                    campaign promises and slogans was he was going to ferret out all of this waste,
                    fraud, and mismanagement within the government. How are you going to increase
                    defense, balance the budget and cut taxes? And his answer was we're going to
                    stop waste, fraud, and mismanagement. So there was a great kind of philosophy of
                    these outsiders on the Reagan team and political conservatives that there is a
                    lot of waste, fraud, and mismanagement, including in State Department. Now, we
                    know that over in the Welfare Department there's a lot of fraud, and other
                    places where people get money, but State Department really doesn't dispense any
                    money. But nevertheless, there must be a lot of waste, fraud, and mismanagement
                    and we're going to find it out. Besides, you've got all these Foreign Service
                    people protecting these Foreign Service people and you don't even know! So there
                    were some strains. In the years I was there they didn't find very much. They
                    didn't prosecute very many Foreign Service people, they didn't find very many
                    crimes. One of the constant irritations I had was one of the things the
                    inspectors always did is when they found misconduct cases, they dealt with them.
                    They usually were not criminal. They were an abusive ambassador or an unfair
                    admin. officer that plays favorites, or a little hanky-panky here and there.
                    Sometimes you got an alcoholic. Inspectors used to ferret this out and deal with
                    it, but we got this new big OIG with 50 investigators and they're not interested
                    in that, they're interested in criminal prosecutions. Somebody's overpaid on his
                    voucher? They want to prove fraud. What fraud? We had a case of an ambassador in
                    Germany who gave a representational affair. He took three members of the press
                    to lunch and bought them lunch for $100 each, so the bill was $400, and I took
                    great pride in collecting that because it didn't meet the requirements and
                    regulations. It wasn't fraud, it was waste and bad judgment. The investigators
                    weren't interested. So as an inspector I was able to do that. That's the kind of
                    stuff inspectors did. They wanted us to refer everything to them, but if so,
                    that killed it for two years, because by the time they investigated and decided
                    to present it to the Justice Department for prosecution and they decided there's
                    no case, then they give it back and say okay, now you guys can deal with it.
                    Well, you're not at post any more. Because these problems we used to solve right
                    on site, right now.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I did a history of the American Consular Service, and in
                        1906 inspectors were called consuls-general at large, and they would go
                        around and do exactly this. They'd act as traveling psychiatrists, settle
                        problems, see where problems were, try to take care of this thing. Like the
                        officer on the beat, who can take care of problems before they turn it into
                        a federal case. Did you see as you dealt with this, did you see a change,
                        and an understanding that the main job of the inspectors, really, once you
                        take care of the obvious fraud things, is to settle problems on the
                        beat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Only moderately. Mostly these outside civil service types do not
                    accept that this is a role for the OIG. They don't understand the inspector's
                    role, because the inspector's role as it grew up, we were really an arm of
                    management. We would clean up the messes for management, and these folks had a
                    different concept of OIG. For them, OIG was an outside, semi-independent agency,
                    like the FBI, to investigate crime, find fraud, prosecute it. So, the DCM is a
                    drunk in Timbuktu? That's not an OIG problem. The Admin. Officer is sexually
                    harassing one of the staff? That's not OIG, that's management, that's EEO or
                    management. So they weren't too interested in these issues, but they didn't want
                    the inspectors or anyone in OIG to do them either. If it were wrongdoing they
                    want to investigate it, and if it's not criminal they want to drop it. So, that
                    was always a source of stress with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Sherman Funk? Because Sherman Funk, whom
                        I have interviewed, was the first one, and he came in and there was distinct
                        hostility, even before he arrived on the scene he was seen as a creature of
                        Jesse Helms, which he wasn't actually, but this was the perception, and he
                        had been dealing in a whole different field. Can you talk a little about
                        Sherman Funk and your relations with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: I have a lot of respect for Sherman Funk, and he for me. I think he
                    has a lot of talent and ability, and he also has the right ideology. I think the
                    Department was very lucky to get him as its first outside Inspector General. I
                    do think that he was kind of dramatic, I do think his affect on the bureaucracy
                    was kind of traumatic, but in retrospect I think that that was necessary.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Exactly, because a lot of the Department, we have a lot of people in
                    the State Department today who are not interested in affirmative action, they're
                    not interested in equal employment opportunities, so that kind of attitude
                    projects to other things. When you talk about improprieties and irregularities,
                    and I'll tell you a story in a minute, a lot of people weren't interested. So
                    Sherman got their attention.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>I'll tell you a quick story. OIG, not very long ago, got a hot line complaint
                    about an ambassador. It came from a member of the staff, who said the ambassador
                    is finagling, he's manipulating, he's, you know, building a swimming pool or
                    whatever it is he's doing. OIG read it over — the reason I know about it is they
                    thought about asking me as a retiree, to go out and check into it. They found
                    out that it wasn't criminal, so the investigators didn't want it. It was just
                    some irregularities, but not criminal. So they gave it to the Bureau, with the
                    recommendation that the Bureau ask me to go check into it, not as an OIG man but
                    as a Bureau Management official. The Bureau decided not to have me do it. So the
                    next time I was in the Bureau, I asked them, whatever happened to that case.
                    They said, “We're going to send a post management officer to look at it.” And
                    they said, they mentioned the ambassador's name, who I'll say is Joe, they said:
                    “You're talking about old Joe, for God's sake. Old Joe wouldn't do that! Old
                    Joe's not guilty of some wrongdoing. That's out of the question!” That's the
                    kind of attitude. Well, I talked to them sharply. I said “Listen, don't be so
                    quick to brush this off, and your post management officer better interview the
                    person who complained. Because if you don't, he'll complain louder, like a
                    letter to Jesse Helms, or a letter to the Secretary and you'll be sorry you
                    didn't listen. So even though you think old Joe wouldn't do that, you better
                    check it out. So I kind of stiffened their backbone a bit, but you had some of
                    that. Not in the inspection system, in the Department. So Sherman got their
                    attention with some of his drama, but didn't find a lot of crime.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well when you were in inspection were you able to do some
                        of what I called the “officer on the beat” straightening out local
                        problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yeah. I got criticized within OIG several times for it too. I found
                    this representation case, for example. The reason I recollect it is it occurred
                    outside the country. This was the ambassador to Germany, drove over to France to
                    a one-star restaurant, took three reporters to lunch, $100 bucks each and turned
                    in a bill for $400. And I showed him regulations that say “for representation
                    within your country of assignment.” This is in France. Pay it back. Well, when I
                    came back I got criticized. You shouldn't do that. You find irregular vouchers
                    you should give it to the investigators. And I said, “It's low priority for
                    them. They won't investigate it for a year or two. The ambassador's gone, the
                    admin. counselor's gone. They'll find out that it was inadvertent, they'll refer
                    it to the Justice Department, the prosecutor says no, and then it comes back to
                    me to fix. Forget it. I've had too many cases like that. At other posts I
                    collected on irregular vouchers, through misunderstanding. And every time I got
                    criticized by OIG. Because the other system, the witnesses are gone, the people
                    have been transferred, you can't fix the problem. So when I was convinced it
                    wasn't criminal, I fixed it myself. I did that, even though OIG criticized
                    it.</p>

                        people to go out on these inspections, do they have to continue working in
                        the same way. It sounds like an apples and oranges type operation, an
                        operation that's geared up for the big case, when you have a little minor
                        petty problems.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: You mean at OIG or at Inspections?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'm having trouble understanding. The OIG is Sherman
                        Funk's operation. But within that inspectors go out, they're part of Sherman
                        Funk's organization, aren't they? What are they doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Oh, they inspect both posts and bureaus. Their mandate is not
                    criminal activity or even wrongdoing. Their mandate is efficiency, economy, and
                    effectiveness. Are things organized right? Is the job getting done? Is money
                    being wasted? And so forth. And in most cases they find things where economies
                    can be effected, where things can be done better and so forth. That's what the
                    inspections do. Now inspections are done organizationally and geographically.
                    Audits are done only functionally. They take a specific function, like security
                    guard program or travel vouchers or leased property. They take some function and
                    audit it in depth. And then investigators investigate crimes and wrongdoing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like you've got a huge staff. In the first place
                        you've got regular auditors who are going through the books anyway. And to
                        have, as you say, auditors who are maybe 90 people and 50 investigators, I
                        mean, it sounds like this is part of waste, in a way. You've got a very big
                        operation to go out and pick up rather minor activities.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Well, I often said that the inspectors should inspect OIG. Because as
                    I said, efficiency, effectiveness and so forth, and it was actually
                    semi-seriously proposed at one time, because we inspect everybody else for
                    efficiency, economy, and effectiveness and write up a report. And I jokingly
                    said after working there for five years, I can write up a report without even
                    doing an inspection. One of the problems I think is the way they are organized.
                    The way they are organized, they need all these people. Their attitude and their
                    organization require that, and I'll take both cases.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>Audits they break up functionally, and they're not just working when they're
                    auditing they're monitoring all the time. They read cables all the time from the
                    State Department. They take a function like INM, the International Narcotics
                    Matters, or they take a function like the Office of Security or FMP, and they
                    have a division in Audits to read all their cables and so forth and then
                    periodically they go audit, but in the meantime they monitor and they work and
                    they challenge and they question and so forth. You and I might think auditors
                    might be able to go audit an organization that they haven't monitored, but the
                    way they do it, its a kind of a year-round activity, and they cover the entire
                    Department. Somebody monitors Personnel and somebody else Consular, they have a
                    Consular branch, and if you do it that way, to cover all the organizations, you
                    need 90 people.</p>
                <p>Investigators do the same thing. They are organized geographically, as if some
                    geographical expertise, as if a voucher thief in Stockholm might have something
                    in common with a voucher thief in Berlin, but not Timbuktu.</p>

                <p>LAUDERDALE: Well that's the way OIG is organized in other Departments and most of
                    their procedures they just brought with them, and they don't fit.</p>

                        were inspectors going out... I mean an inspector arrives and problems

                        But most of these problems are not criminal, but they certainly are
                        organizational and often deal with personalities. How were you all treating
                        these personality problems which were coming out and were affecting the

                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: When I joined, the inspectors were almost exclusively Foreign Service
                    and the whole system was geared for that. The new people come in the summer, we
                    had a training session, an orientation session, you start inspecting in the fall
                    and so forth. Well Sherman changed most of that. More than half of the
                    inspectors are not civil servants. That had some unintended consequences. One is
                    that the new crop of foreign service inspectors every year only totals four or
                    five. We used to have Eagleburger and all of the Assistant Secretaries come talk
                    at an annual grouping of inspectors. This last year they didn't do that. The
                    rest of OIG resented it. They didn't have the training program either. Didn't
                    have enough people. Because now most of the inspectors don't rotate out. There
                    were when I started 42 inspectors, it's down a little bit to 38 or 40, more than
                    half are civil service, so you only have about 10 or 12 Foreign Service
                    inspectors, so each year you may only get five or six. The civil servant ones,
                    many are ex FSOs that retired early, and were hired as civil servants. And the
                    others that were pure civil service have been doing it so long that they have a
                    Foreign Service ambience about them. So what do they do? They do what the
                    Foreign Service inspectors have always done. They're not as good. An FSO 1, if
                    he goes out and talks to a Political Officer who has some problem with FCA, he
                    may be able to help that officer. The civil servant can't do that the same. They
                    just don't know how. But we deal with Personnel problems, somebody on the team
                    does basically the same way as we always did.</p>

                        things to say about the inspection thing or how you felt about the career as

                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>LAUDERDALE: Yes. I was promoted to senior rank - FSO-2 (now OC) in 1975, just
                    before I went from Bonn to Madrid; and to FSO-1 (now MC) in 1980, just before I
                    became DAS for Personnel. My rank was converted to MC in 1980, and I
                    subsequently recieved two LCE's of 3 years each. LCE's were stopped, and I
                    reached my time in class of 1990, when I was DAS for Inspections in OIG. I filed
                    a grievance, and my time was extended a few months while it was being
                    considered. I was mandatorily retired in January, 1991, at age 60. Ironically,
                    that's the same time I would have been required to retire (at age 60) under the
                    old system. It was still two or three years earlier that I wanted to retire. A
                    big pay raise had been approved in 1989 after having been capped for several
                    years, and I benefitted from only 1 year of the higher pay for my annuity, which
                    is based on the high 3 years of salary. And of course, I had virtually no chance
                    for promotion to Career Minister, which would have extended my time. So that was
                    the basis for my grievance: equal pay for equal work, because of the difference
                    in my pension from that of an officer, even of lower rank, who had been promoted
                    slower, would retire a year or two later, and who would have benefitted from a
                    full three years after the pay raise; and because there had not really been an
                    opportunity for promotion. The greivance was denied, and I retired. Retirement
                    is difficult for most people, but it's a lot harder to be retired mandatorily
                    than it is to pick your own timing. Bob Ryan reached his time in class a year
                    before I did, and he was five years younger. He too filed a grievance, and lost,
                    although the process allowed him to serve one of the three years under the
                    higher salary. Because of the frozen salary, then a big make-up pay raise, I
                    thought (and still think) mandatory retirements should be suspended to permit
                    officers to get a new high-three annuity. Still, after I saw what happened to
                    people in the years immediately following my retirement, I realize that I was
                    relatively fortunate.</p>
                <p>I guess one thing I would close on is when you retire, particularly a case like
                    me, a former ambassador, you can't just fade into the sunset. I got a call this
                    week, and I have an appointment tomorrow, to go meet with the lawyers to testify
                    in an EEO suit about actions ten years ago. So this is the second or third time
                    that I've had to come back and deal with an old issue. So I save files at home.
                    I'm careful about throwing things away, because you don't know what might come
                    up later. I gave three days testimony in the black officer's class action suit,
                    three days deposition, so I'm waiting to get called for trial. So I've had
                    things like that. There's always some loose ends for a while.</p>
