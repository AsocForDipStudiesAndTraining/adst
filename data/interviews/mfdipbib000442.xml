                <p>ALAN GREEN JR.</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Jim Strassmaier</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: April 20, 1999</p>
                <p>Copyright 2003 ADST</p>
                <p>Q: This is an oral history with Alan “Punch” Green, and the date today is the
                    20th of April, 1999, and the interviewer is Jim Strassmaier for the Oregon
                    Historical Society.</p>
                <p>To start out, I wonder if I could simply have you state your fulname and the date
                    and place of your birth.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. It's Alan Green, Junior. I have no middle initial. My friends call me
                    Punch. I don't know what my enemies call me, but I'd just as soon not find
                    out.</p>
                <p>But I got the nickname from my father who was nicknamed Punch, and he got it from
                    Michigan where he was born in Saginaw, Michigan, and I asked him how he got the
                    nickname Punch, and he said, “None of your business.” So there you have it.</p>
                <p>In the 1920s, an informal organization was active in Portland. They were known
                    locally as the Hoot Owls - I believe they broadcast on radio once a week
                    (Saturday night - 11:00 to 12:00 midnight) from the old Oregonian Building at
                    6th and Alder.</p>
                <p>I mention this because the names include Charles and Forrest Berg, Frank Sardams,
                    Harry S. Grannatt, Homer Welch, and Alan “Punch” Green, Sr. - the Grand Song
                    Master (my dad). It's my understanding Dad had to come up with a song every
                    week. He had the natural talent to do this. I don't have it, and I've yet to see
                    it in my children or eight grandchildren.</p>
                <p>The Hoot Owls are important to me because on or about May 1, 1925, I was made a
                    member - I guess that makes me the only remaining Hoot Owl sans the talent of my
                    illustrious predecessors.</p>
                <p>Now, I was born on May the 1st, 1925, in Portland, Oregon, and mmother was Helen
                    Corbett Ladd, a prominent family in Oregon.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Q: Could you tell me something about the traditions, beginning with the Ladds,
                    your mother's side of the family, and what you knew of them, and what you heard
                    from your mother about the family?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, actually, it's really kind of a sad story. The Ladds did an awful
                    lot for this area, and W.S. Ladd was one of the founders, for example, of the
                    Arlington Club and was a banker, Ladd &amp; Tilton Bank, which, of course,
                    established the U.S. National Bank here. They went under, under the tutelage of
                    my grandfather, Wesley Ladd, and I think it's Charles Ladd, and it was a bad
                    trip. Going from rich to poor is very difficult, and combined with the
                    Depression - this even happened before the Depression.</p>
                <p>But my mother lost her hearing, and Dad, I think, lost his nerve. He was a
                    marvelous man; I don't want anybody to misinterpret. I love my father very
                    deeply, but he lost his nerve, and he turned, I think, to booze. He handled it
                    pretty well, but I was young. But I knew that he had a problem, and Mother lost
                    her hearing. I mean, I went to Ainsworth School, and she was the cashier in the
                    cafeteria, and I have a feeling that - I was never aware of it, but I think that
                    that's how I got fed - so she didn't have to pay for the lunch for me.</p>
                <p>She had some awfully good staunch friends, and Dad did, too. But I was aware that
                    we didn't have any particular money, but I also wasn't that aware because I was
                    a boy, you don't realize those things when you're a kid. Everybody was broke
                    anyway in the Depression.</p>
                <p>And we had some marvelous people living across the street from us on Talbot Road
                    on Portland Heights by the name of Octy and Roberta Graham. I asked them to be
                    my godmother and godfather, and they accepted to my joy. And they had a dog
                    named Jiggs. We couldn't afford a dog, so I adopted Jiggs, and they had two of
                    the greatest sons I've ever known, Clark Graham and Douglas Graham, and both of
                    them have passed on. But they were certainly my boyhood friends.</p>
                <p>And I remember Aunt Bob Graham gave me my first pair of long pants for Christmas,
                    and she's been a dear friend of mine ever since. I love her dearly, and she's
                    101 years old. And I just last week, Jim, saw her, and her main concern was
                    getting the Master's Golf Tournament on television. I mean, that's, when you're
                    101 and you have that sort of interest. Her eyesight is leaving her, but I gave
                    her a “Books on Tape” mechanism and she's utilizing that, and the state of
                    Oregon provides Books on Tape free of charge, you just return them. It's a
                    marvelous service that I wasn't aware that they do. But that's, I think, filled
                    her day quite a bit.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>But I played the usual things, football, baseball. I was a track man,
                    surprisingly enough. At Lincoln School, I almost had the record for the - I had
                    the record for the quarter mile, but then I twisted my ankle chasing Sol Menashe
                    because he'd stolen my lunch, and I slipped and twisted my ankle, and I couldn't
                    get my speed back in time to get the record, and that's something - it's a funny
                    thing, all my life I've kind of regretted that becausLincoln, you know, we
                    didn't have any really good football team; we had good baseball teams, but, you
                    know - and basketball teams, we had good basketball teams.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if we could sort of go back to your family for a
                        bit.You say your dad lost his nerve. About what time -?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, I think when the Ladd estate went down the tube, and that sort of
                    thing. I think he was a broker, and I think he would have been tremendously
                    successful if he'd stayed with it. He had that kind of personality. But it just
                    didn't work out, and I can remember Dad - well, I suppose it's all right to say
                    - picking up the telephone and talking about some business thing, and I picked
                    up the telephone and the line was dead on the other side. I mean, that sort of
                    thing. You know, it was sad.</p>
                <p>But Dad, I tell you one thing he did. During World War II, he took a job in the
                    shipyard, and you know, the people I was going with were pretty fancy, and Dad
                    was, I think, a timekeeper down there, and he'd take the streetcar home. And I'd
                    be on the streetcar with him sometimes, and you know, I'd go over and sit with
                    him, and he'd say, “You don't have to sit with me,” you know, so I'd be
                    embarrassed. And I said, “Dad, I'm proud to sit with you.”</p>
                <p>And then Mother, she had a tough time with it for a while, an awful tough time.
                    But Lord, the more she came on - and maybe I'm jumping ahead, and if I am, I'm
                    sorry, but I think one of the biggest pleasures of whatever success I've had is
                    the fact that I was able to take care of my mother at the end. She didn't have
                    anything to worry about, and it wasn't tough for me to help her.</p>
                <p>Well, we'll stay with this, but I do want to put in right now that the most
                    important decision I've reached, ever reached in my life is the girl I married,
                    Joan Irwin. She was right with me all the time, and through the booze and the
                    whole thing, and if I'd taken another drink, I wouldn't be married to her - and
                    justifiably so, I might add. Go ahead.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, you're having a really full picture of your life, going back. But that
                    makes a lot of sense.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. But I do want to get in early on that I would not be a success
                    without Joan. Joan had some money, too. Her father was a very successful
                    lumberman. We didn't use it particularly; I was able to make money. But I used
                    her guarantee a couple times. That was very helpful because the bank wouldn't go
                    along with me, but they'd take it with her guarantee. But we never had to - it
                    never cost her anything, and she did very well because I put her name on the
                    certificates. But anyway, that's jumping ahead on you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your father's background, his family
                        background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, they were in the timber business, the lumber business in Michigan.
                    Very prominent. As a matter of fact, I went to see Dad's home in Michigan, and
                    now it's a mortuary, in downtown Saginaw. They had a place at Higgins Lake, and
                    they had timber. They were in the lumber business, and they got burned out. And
                    apparently they had some lumber here in Oregon, and that's the reason Dad came
                    to Oregon and the whole bunch. There was an Uncle Don came to Oregon, and he was
                    in the life insurance business. They came out here. I've never really - I'm kind
                    of guilty about it, but I've never really looked into the Greens and the
                    Ladds.</p>
                <p>I have a theory on this, and it probably sounds awful. Maybe we ought to not even
                    put it in there, but it's a private theory as long as I'm talking, and then we
                    can - that when people lose everything, you kind of tend to forget them. Now,
                    the Rockefellers, if they hadn't made any money, I'm pretty sure you wouldn't
                    hear much about the Rockefellers, and that's kind of - I will tell you this,
                    though, and I am convinced of this, the fact that I'm Punch Green's son and I'm
                    Helen Ladd's son has been very helpful to me in Oregon from the older people who
                    helped me get started. People were very kind to me. They wanted to see me
                    succeed.</p>
                <p>Q: You could really tell that.GREEN: You bet I could tell that. And Howard Irwin,
                    who was my father-in-law, and Doris Irwin were wonderful people, and I got along
                    with them very well. He was a successful lumberman out of Coos Bay, Oregon,
                    North Bend. They lived in Portland because they didn't want their daughters to
                    live in North Bend.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, your mother with this - I think what I've been
                        reading iit's around 1925 that the collapse occurs. It's the date of your
                        birth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. I'll tell you a funny story about it. She didn't think she was
                    pregnant, and Dr. Labbe examined her, and she says, “It's impossible, I can't be
                    pregnant.” And Dr. Labbe said, “Helen, to my recollection, there's only been one
                    immaculate conception.” And I'm certainly not that! But that's a true story.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>But it must have been an awful shock to them. I had a sister, incidentally, and
                    she died, and I think she also had booze problems. She at one time was married
                    to Henri Labbe. They have a wonderful son and daughter. They live in Seattle.
                    But I'd just as soon not talk about Henri.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your sister's name was -?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Was Helen - well, they called her Ladd, Helen Ladd Green Labbe, yes. My
                    daughter's, too, I have a daughter named that. Go ahead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did it mean to your mother to go through that? Do you
                        hava sense of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. Dad and Mom used to have some pretty bad fights privately. And I
                    didn't understand the picture. I was just - I'd just go hole myself up, that's
                    all. But after a while, they got it simmered down to where they were, I think,
                    quite content with each other.</p>
                <p>Mother never remarried. My mother had to be one of the most beautiful women I've
                    ever seen, and I'm not saying that because I'm a son. She was nominated to be
                    the Rose Festival Queen, for example. In those days, you just were selected, and
                    my grandparents wouldn't have anything to do with it. It was too much
                    publicity.</p>
                <p>My grandparents were Wesley Ladd and Delia Ladd. She was from New Orleans.
                    Donaldson was her name, Delia Donaldson, and Wesley Ladd. And I don't know, he
                    established the Snowshoe Club up in Mt. Hood. I've never been there, and I gave
                    them a box. I'm not much of an outdoorsman, never have been. But I'd like to be,
                    but I'm just a klutz when it comes to that sort of thing, and I never really
                    enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>But you know, it's just a circumstance, and I'm awfully glad I was able to get
                    through all of this stuff. I think it did a lot for me. It made me think that it
                    can be done type of thing, and people were encouraging, and I just, I had a good
                    friend of mine - I was thinking about this on the way down, our conversation,
                    and maybe I'm rambling for you. Am I rambling too much?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rambling's fine.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I had a friend named Bumps Duthie. He lived right next door to me, and Tom
                    Duthie was an older brother. But Bumps, they went back - this was before the
                    war, World War II - but they went back to England - that's where they were from,
                    Scotland - and Bumps was killed in a train accident. That's the first time I'd
                    ever at that age experienced death.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at what age?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, I'd say I was 11, 12. I was really fond of him, and it was a very
                    difficult moment for me to realize that this sort of thing can happen. He was
                    wonderful, he would have been a wonderful man.</p>
                <p>But one thing we have, and why I came back to Portland, Oregon, rather than stay
                    in Washington where I had some opportunity to be a talking head on television,
                    that sort of thing, was because of my roots in Oregon, and I feel deeply about
                    it. And I've got friends like Roger Meier, Gordon Grout, Roger Madden, and
                    people I've just known all my life. Some have passed on, Jim Stevens. But you
                    know, you start mentioning one person, you leave somebody else off, but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you mean by roots?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I mean my family roots go way back, people I've shared experiences
                    with. I mean, in the business world, for example. You move on to other things
                    once I sold the business, but there were certain people who were terribly
                    important, and I saw to it that they had a piece of the action. Well, we can
                    talk about this later.</p>
                <p>But I just felt Portland is what I'm a native of, it's in my blood, and I've
                    always been proud of this place and proud of the people I know, and my family.
                    The Corbetts, of course, they retained some of their wealth, and they've been
                    more important because of their retention of their wealth. That's our
                    cousins.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your mother - were there signs earlier and then for
                        the resof her life, of resentment or injury or regrets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, that's a beautiful thing about her. I'm sure she felt ideeply, but no,
                    she didn't show it.</p>
                <p>My wife Joan absolutely adored my mother, and Mother was one of the kindest - she
                    was one of the probably most popular people you'll ever know, and everybody
                    loved her. She just had this grace about her with defeat that was there, you
                    just couldn't help but admire her.</p>
                <p>As I say, one of the big pleasures of my life is the fact that the last 10, 15
                    years of her life, she died at 87, was that she didn't have any worries. She
                    thought she had worries, but she didn't believe me when I'd tell her, but I was
                    able to take care of her - or help her.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Q: Tell me a bit about your relationship. Tell me not a bit about your
                    relationship. I'd really like to hear about your relationship with your mom,
                    your memories, early memories of her.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I can never remember Mother hearing. One time it came back to her
                    very suddenly, but only for five minutes, and then she lost it. Actually, I was
                    closer - when I was growing up, I felt closer to Dad then I did to Mom. I hate
                    to say it, but I did. My sister was pretty rough on Dad, and that's why I think
                    I probably took his side maybe a little bit more.</p>
                <p>GREEN: But Mom - well, she was always there for me. I don't know, it is all kind
                    of murky. I didn't, I was very active. I was very active in the student body. I
                    was student body president of Lincoln High School in 1943. But in Ainsworth, I
                    was - my father wrote the Ainsworth School song, for example. It was by Alan
                    Green, and I've got it here. Sometimes I think they ought to sing it. It's a
                    good little song for Ainsworth School, and sometimes they do, sometimes they
                    don't. But I have grandchildren who've gone through there, are going through
                    there now.</p>
                <p>But Mom was an outstanding person, but I think she became far more - these things
                    happen to you. You don't just overnight become an angel. I mean, it takes a long
                    time to realize.</p>
                <p>And Mother had a very good friend named Carolyn Ladd Pratt Herter. She was at one
                    time married to Christian Herter, the former Secretary of State. And she heard
                    of Mother's plight, and so she bought through Kenneth Reed, a life insurance,
                    New England life insurance man, a policy on Mother's life which paid Mom about -
                    I don't know, a stipend every month, and that was enough to get them through the
                    toughest times, because that's when a dime was a dime, you know, that sort of
                    thing. And I imagine some other people helped, too, that I wasn't aware of
                    it.</p>
                <p>But I tried to see her, Mrs. Herter, in Boston, but she passed awajust as I was
                    about ready to visit. But anyway, I do remember that.</p>
                <p>We lived in a house on Talbot Road, a large house, as a matter of fact. It's not
                    there anymore. The reservoir expanded, and they took it over. Sometimes I go by
                    Talbot Road just to see some of the houses that were there when I was a young
                    boy. I live on Hawthorne Terrace, not far from it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, maybe you can describe the house.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: It was a large house, and it had a hill, so when it snowed, everybody came
                    up and we used to slide down there when we were kids. Later on, we went to
                    Periander Street to slide down, which was a little more daring, I guess.</p>
                <p>And I finally got a room of my own, and Dad and Mom slept out in thsleeping
                    porch.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>You could tell that at one time there was wealth because the furniture was - I
                    suppose you could say now the furniture was beautiful stuff. And as a matter of
                    fact, I've got a partner's desk in our bedroom in Portland here, and things like
                    that that the Ladds at one time owned. Or the Greens owned; there was wealth on
                    the Green side of the family, too. They both went down the tube really about the
                    same time. It was just more than, I guess, Dad could take. You know, times were
                    tough, and getting a drink was an easy way out, I guess.</p>
                <p>But I want to say one thing about my father. He kept himself, he died of cancer.
                    It was a tough death, boy, it was tough death. It started in the tongue, he
                    smoked, and it went - you know. But anyway, Dad was in intense pain, and he was
                    at Good Samaritan Hospital, and he asked to be kept alive so that they could
                    learn something. And I remember walking into his room once and there were four
                    or five interns probing my father, and I just looked at them and I said okay,
                    but I almost went after them, but I didn't. I knew that's what Dad wanted. But
                    boy, that was a tough moment. And he died, but I think he died a hero.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You almost wanted to release him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes, I mean, you know. But boy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He actually made that conscious decision that he wanted
                        to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, not to live, but for medical reasons, right. I mean, it was in the
                    '50s. He saw Joan and I get married in 1949, and he couldn't go to the - yes, he
                    did go to the reception, he sat there. Yes. And he saw my first child.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How old were you when he started drinking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's probably at the crisis time that that began to
                        happen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, I don't know. I mean, I didn't even realize it. I remember once he
                    came home, you know, he'd fallen down, and I didn't think anything, I thought
                    he'd stumbled or something. But it was more than that. I mean, I found the empty
                    bottles. And I had the same problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember, how old were you when you overheard the
                        phoncall, your father with nobody on the line?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, let's see. It was before Pearl Harbor. I suppose I wa12, 13.</p>
                <p>Boy, he was a great actor. He was in the Junior League Follies, and I was in the
                    Junior League Cabaret, and I tell you, the older people would come and they'd
                    say, “You're good, but you're not as good as your dad,” you know. He had
                    tremendous talent. He could play the piano, and he never took a lesson. He could
                    just pick it up immediately. He had rhythm. I keep looking for it in my
                    grandchildren, and it's not there. He was just terrific from that standpoint. I
                    think he was a very popular young man. He was a good-looking guy. It was just -
                    you see it happen in your own friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a pretty lively and attractive person, then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. Oh, God, yes. And so was Mother. You should see pictures of her.
                    She was just - and she was an only child. So, you know, all the affection was
                    lavished on her. You know, where the Oregonian building is now, that's where my
                    great- grandfather's house was, and right across the street is their stable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, is it? Oh, that building.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: That building's the stable, the Ladd stable. So, when I say roots, I mean,
                    you know - I don't usually do this too often, I mean, what you and I are doing.
                    It brings back thoughts and memories that- (end of tape)Q: -other important
                    moments in your childhood, let's say, from earlier times, the earlier memories
                    and the important things that have sort of stuck in your mind up until about age
                    12.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, Jerry Strohecker up there. It was a real match. We used to play ice
                    skate hockey, and I was usually the goalie, and I remember taking the hockey
                    stick and bending it so that I could be sure and lift the puck and injure my
                    fellow opponents, and they were doing the same thing to me. I don't know how we
                    lived through it.</p>
                <p>But I remember once the Grahams took me to Taft Beach for a week to stay with
                    them, Doug Graham who was my age, and Clark Graham. And it's my first and only
                    time I've ever been homesick, and I remember I was in the same bedroom with
                    Doug, and crying myself to sleep and trying to keep from him hearing, and I
                    don't think he did hear because knowing Doug, he would have said something about
                    it. But I've often wondered if it would ever happen to me again, and it never
                    did. I got over it, but that was a kind of a - well, it's part of growing up, I
                    guess.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>I remember some kids getting a lot of presents every day, and I've asked about
                    them occasionally, what's happened to them, and they just disappeared. So I, you
                    know, I certainly didn't have hard knocks, I mean, nothing like I think some of
                    the other people did. I mean, when you go to Lincoln, they used to call Portland
                    Heights “Snob Hill,” and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>Gerry Frank's a very good friend of mine. I went to Ainsworth School with him.
                    But none of us felt that we were deprived. You don't at that age, anyway - I
                    never did, anyway. I thought I was a pretty lucky fellow.</p>
                <p>And I should mention Maurie Dooly of Dooly &amp; Company; he was a gentleman in
                    insurance. I went to work for him when I was about 15 years old. Actually, the
                    Meiers, I went to work for Meier &amp; Frank's when I was about 14. Allen Meier,
                    Roger Meier's dad, hired me for about $40 a month -$44 a month, because I think
                    I got a net $40, and I gave $10 to Dad and Mom. That was terrific at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>And I remember one job I had, they put me over in the warehouse, the receiving
                    warehouse, and they had some barrels of china that had been shipped in, and it
                    was all in straw, and so we could take the top off, but we couldn't get to the
                    bottom. So they'd hold me by my feet, and I would go down until I sneezed and
                    then they'd give me about a 10-minute rest. But anyway, that was an
                    experience.</p>
                <p>One thing I admired about my parents, too, is that a lot of kids my age, just
                    high school kids, were getting jobs at the shipyards and things, and getting
                    pretty big money, you know, $150 a month type of thing, which went a long, long
                    ways, and Dad and Mom both wanted me to work at Dooly &amp; Company, where maybe
                    it was $50, $60, but I learned something about business, and I learned a lot of
                    things. And you know, considering the fact that Mom and Dad were in pretty bum
                    shape financially, I thought that was a pretty good - I mean, it's occurred to
                    me since it was quite a gesture on their part.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did other kids that you knew provide money to their
                        parents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, I don't think so. I mean, I don't think they had to. mean, kids I knew
                    up in the Heights.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of an impression did that make on you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I don't think it made much of an impression. I didn't think much about it.
                    Nobody talked about it. As a matter of fact, this is one of the few times I've
                    ever mentioned it that I ever did it. It's just, you know, it seemed the natural
                    thing to do, and I'd see their face light up with pride and things like that. It
                    made me feel pretty good.</p>

                    it's love, it's a deep love. You know, I don't blame, I know people. My sister
                    tended to do that. She blamed the Ladds for losing and things, and I said, you

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had one sister?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: One sister. She died.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And she died when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, I think 10, 15 years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, okay. Not during her younger life.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, no. She had boyfriends, and, you know, it was kind of fun; I used to
                    hide behind a bush and watch them. She was a beautiful woman. Jesus, Sis was
                    absolutely gorgeous. She was a redhead, and boy, she was a beautiful gal. But it
                    just didn't work out right.</p>
                <p>I remember Maurie Dooly gave the reception because we couldn't afford it. And Dad
                    cried throughout. I suppose he had a little booze in him, but he couldn't
                    control himself.</p>
                <p>Q: The natural stuff came out?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. And Sis was mad and, you know, all this stuff kind of gets to you
                    a little bit, but you just don't think about it that much. I mean, I really had
                    a wonderfully happy childhood. I was loved, and I loved the people in return,
                    and I was a leader at Ainsworth, and then the student body president. I was even
                    president of all the student body presidents in the Portland area.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>I knew that I was going to do well if - I didn't think I was going to have a
                    booze problem. That's for a later date, and we'll talk about it if you want
                    because it's a very important part of my life.</p>
                <p>But I just have always had this confidence, this upbeat confidence that I just
                    feel is what's necessary, and I see it with others. Never try to be
                    self-employed unless you're an optimist. You can be a pessimist, that's the
                    easiest thing in the world to be. Being an optimist is difficult at times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of messages along that line did you get from
                        youparents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I really didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes, it's really overt and sometimes...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, Dad, for example, said to me when I went to Stanford - I'm jumping
                    ahead a little bit, but he was surprised I got into Stanford. I got into
                    Stanford because I was hurt in World War II - not injured, not wounded, hurt,
                    because I had known some people who were wounded and killed. There's a
                    difference. What happened to me could have happened on the highway. I've got two
                    Tantalum plates in my head from World War II. We could talk about that.</p>
                <p>But Dad said to me, he said, and this was his philosophy, and he was right. He
                    says, “I know you, you're a salesman, and you're a good salesman.” He said,
                    “That's what you should be.” But he said, “Just have a wonderful four years.
                    You're never going to get it again, but just don't flunk out.” And he was right.
                    That was the right thing to say to a guy like me.</p>
                <p>And I didn't flunk out, I was a C student. But I had a wonderful four years. I
                    got good grades at Lincoln, good grades at Ainsworth, I suppose. Yes, I got very
                    good grades, but I'd never been a student.</p>
                <p>Lincoln, of course, I went with the Lincoln that was up here, not the Lincoln
                    that you know today. It's the old Main, I think they call it, or Lincoln Hall at
                    Portland State University where I went. Our campus was the Park Blocks, and I
                    remember during the war, I was student body president, and we collected more
                    scrap than anybody. I couldn't afford a car, but somebody would drive me over to
                    Grant to see how they were doing, and we were beating them. That was very
                    important to me that we beat Grant; that we collected more scrap than anybody.
                    We got some sort of an award in that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were pretty popular in school?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, I'd say that's probably right. I think I was prettpopular.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you attribute that to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, I think a cross between my Dad and my Mom. They were both - Dad was a
                    very funny man, and Mother was - at the end, I mean, you could see where she
                    was. The last 15 years, she was a different person than she was before. I mean,
                    she'd come to grips with herself, so to speak.</p>
                <p>I'm always saying weird things that I think are very funny. Sometimes I have to
                    watch it when I don't know the person that well. But I've been blessed with a
                    sense of humor, and I don't know where I get it from, but I'm awful glad I've
                    got it because I see a lot of funny things that other people don't think are
                    funny. That goes for Romania right through. I mean, it's just a fantastic thing
                    you're born with, I think. I've come to that conclusion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there some Irish heritage?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, we've got some Irish in us. I think we're mainly English; I think so.
                    I think, if I want to be real fancy, I think we've got somebody named Webster
                    that came over on the Mayflower. I mean, you know, sort of a pilgrim.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the Green side or...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, the Green side. But that's going back a little bit.But I think we're
                    mainly English.</p>
                <p>Q: Were some of the other families - I mean, you came with this name, and then
                    all the reputation behind the name - were some of the other families - your
                    family wasn't stuffy, it sounds like.</p>
                <p>GREEN: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were some of the other families more rigid or more -
                        well,self-important or...</hi>

                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, you always run across that, but for me, not particularly, no. I didn't
                    think so because - you know the old saying, there was an old saying at one time
                    when I was growing up, that, let's see, the Ladds speak to the Corbetts and the
                    Corbetts speak to God, something like that. So I still was a Ladd, and you know,
                    at that age it meant something to those people. There was the Ladd Addition.
                    Reed College, I think, is my grandfather's old farm, that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you thought about that as a kid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I thought about it; yes, I did. But I didn't make anything of it because
                    there was nothing to back it up. I mean, I knew about it, but nobody told me. I
                    just - things you'd hear about occasionally.</p>
                <p>I'll tell you who was awfully nice to us were the Meiers, were terribly nice.
                    Allen Meier, and his wife, I think it was Jane, Roger's parents, they had the
                    swimming pool on Portland Heights, and they'd always let us kids go down there
                    and swim in the summer. And it was a marvelous thing to do. We all had to get
                    out of the pool when Mrs. Meier wanted to take a swim - and she'd get out of the
                    pool, then we'd all go in.</p>
                <p>But it was a good youth. I never traveled much, but I don't thinmany of us did.
                    It was more difficult to travel.</p>
                <p>Q: I'd like to know more about your parents, say, in the political area. These
                    are times when things are suddenly turned upside down by FDR and...</p>
                <p>GREEN: I think Dad - Dad was a staunch Republican, and so was Mother, and of
                    course I got it from there. Dad, I have a feeling that there was a Roper poll
                    apparently that showed Alfred Landon beating Franklin Roosevelt. My father hated
                    Franklin Roosevelt. And I think Dad made a bet on it, because he was sure sick
                    afterwards. It was just Maine and Vermont were the only states that Landon
                    carried. I remember that - because politics has always been my hobby. And I'm
                    sure that if we'd had any money, any money, we would have moved to Maine or
                    Vermont. It really - Dad went to bed.</p>
                <p>And that was the atmosphere in which I was raised. That was the way they felt,
                    there wasn't any question about it. And that's one reason why, of course, I've
                    been active in the Republican party. But I'm dismayed at the Republican party
                    now because of the far right and the religious far right. I won't tolerate them.
                    I happen to be pro-choice, not the other. I don't think it's a political issue;
                    I think it's a personal issue. But we could talk about that later on.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>I filled out a questionnaire the other day because this happens to be my 50th
                    reunion for Stanford, and I was filling out some things and they wanted to know,
                    and they said, “political party,” and I said, “Republican,” and then I put after
                    it in parentheses “moderate,” so that they wouldn't think I was one of those
                    kooks.</p>
                <p>But there wasn't any question about it, and all Dad's and Mom's friends were the
                    same. There wasn't any - everybody was Republican where I was up in Portland
                    Heights.</p>
                <p>Q: Eventually, Republicans began to take on some of the coloration of the New
                    Deal. When Wendell Wilkie ran, he was kind of a left-wing Republican.</p>
                <p>GREEN: I guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how do you think your parents were affected by the

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: If he was a Republican, they'd pass him. I think if Clinton was a
                    Republican, I don't think he'd be there. I think they'd get him out of there. I
                    think the fact he's a Democrat is the one thing that saved him. But that's
                    neither here nor there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So did they make some distinctions about the things that
                        werdone in the New Deal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Dad didn't like Social Security. Yes, he didn't like Social Security,
                    thought it was going to break the country. There was that feeling among people
                    at that time.They simply didn't like this government, that's all. I mean, they
                    were willing to do anything for the government. They were great Americans. But
                    they were very conservative in the sense of business conservatives, didn't want
                    to see the money wasted, type of thing. I mean, it was a big thing for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, did you find yourself at any time saying, “Well, but
                        Dad...?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, occasionally, but most of the time he made sense to me. Mother
                    didn't. I mean, she was deaf, too. We'd talk about it occasionally, but I'd
                    agree with him most of the time.</p>
                <p>Yes, I mean, every once in a while, they'd say something. I remember Wayne Morse
                    started out as a Republican, for God's sakes, and turned over to be a Democrat.
                    And I was - you know, that was a difficult time for everybody. But I went along
                    with whatever they wanted, and then I started - but that's later on.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Q: When you went from home and then to school, did you find yourself talking
                    issues with people at school and finding yourself having to respond to kids who
                    had a different perspective?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Not really. I think people were far more concerned aboumaking a living and
                    eating and things like that. It was the Depression.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't happening, in other words.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, it wasn't. You weren't talking about anything. You didn't have the
                    communication you've got now. I mean, you know, something happens in Bucharest,
                    so they know it immediately in downtown Portland. I mean, it would be eight
                    weeks before you'd hear anything in the '30s, and it wouldn't make any
                    difference anyway to you. So everything was different. Radio was your mode of
                    communication. I remember the crystal set even. Milk was delivered. I mean,
                    there just wasn't the communication that you have now. And what it's going to be
                    in a hundred years, I don't know, but it should be exciting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were a lot of the kids, a majority of the kids from
                        Republicafamilies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, I think so. Oregon was a pretty strong Republican statfor a
                    while.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There might have been, you know, less debate on account of
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, I think a lot of that's true. There was a great mix at Lincoln High
                    School. You had what they called Slab Town. And I've still got friends from that
                    section. You had Portland Heights, had them all. But we didn't get in any
                    particular political discussions. I mean, they all knew I was a Republican, and
                    I knew some guys were Democrats. The Jewish people seemed to tend to be more
                    Democrats than Republicans, which I think they have a feeling that - they're
                    very wealthy people, but they have a feeling they're a minority group and that
                    sort of thing, and that's how they go Democrat. The blacks tend to be Democrats
                    more than Republicans. I suppose I didn't really blame them much either.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, some, but not too many. Jefferson had most of thblacks. They had the
                    football teams, too, you couldn't touch them.</p>

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, some, but not a lot. A lot of Jewish fellows, I knew them very well.
                    I've always been very fond of Jewish people. I just think they're smart people,
                    most of them, and I had wonderful relations with them. And some blacks, yes. I
                    know with government later on, I mean, if they were good, boy, I'd see that they
                    went up the chain fast. But that's for a later talk.</p>
                <p>Q: Tell me something, if you will, about teachers. Maybe back in Ainsworth, some
                    people stand out who you did something for you or to you.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, we had Mr. Gunn. Henry Gunn was the principal at Ainsworth, and he
                    went on to be superintendent of schools. I remember when he walked in the room,
                    I was in about the second grade, I guess, and everybody had to stand up and
                    introduce themselves. And I stood up and introduced myself as just “Punch
                    Green.” He had a big grin, and the kids laughed.</p>
                <p>And then we had some wonderful teachers. I'm glad you asked the question because
                    we had a Miss Protszman in the eighth grade. She's probably the best teacher
                    I've ever had anywhere, and I think that others would confirm it. If you asked
                    Roger Meier, Gerry Frank, Gordon Grout, or somebody, she was just fantastic, and
                    we were so prepared by the time we got to Lincoln, we were just way ahead of the
                    crowd.</p>
                <p>We'd always go and serenade her at Christmas. We'd go and sing carols to her,
                    and... She was a wonderful woman. She was tough; oh God, she was tough, but when
                    you were through with Ms. Protszman, you knew that you were ready. I can almost
                    do it now, the stuff that she had me learn and just hammered it at you. She was
                    wonderful.</p>
                <p>But Ainsworth had some - there was a Miss - I think Regan was my first grade
                    teacher. I remember the first grade, Mother took me to Ainsworth. I didn't go to
                    kindergarten because I think that was costly at that time. So I went to the
                    first grade, and Mother had to take me home because I couldn't stop crying. And
                    I think Mabel Bishop, Mabel Livingstone, Mort Bishop's wife, was in that first
                    grade with me. And she had similar problems money-wise, their parents had lost
                    it all. But she remarked to me that she remembers that first day when I
                    cried.</p>
                <p>Then I had no trouble the next day. I was alright from there on. But something
                    just came unglued. I don't know what it was, but I just couldn't stop
                    crying.</p>
                <p>I never really liked school much. I've always loved the things around school, but
                    I'm not a student. I never have been much of a student in the sense of learning.
                    I think I'm street-smart, yes, but I've just never really -. A lot of the stuff
                    I just thought was such a waste to even know. And it's culture, and I was wrong.
                    I mean, they're right, I'm wrong.</p>
                <p>

                <p>GREEN: Well, I learned. I guess you could say I was bright. But my interest level
                    wasn't very high. I was more a people person. I still work the crowd. I don't
                    have to anymore, but I still do. It's just something that started a long time
                    ago. I have a bad feeling if I don't say hello to somebody, right now - and a
                    lot of times I can't remember the name, and one of the awful things about being
                    named Punch is that everybody can remember the name, but I can't remember their
                    name. I mean, you know, I fake it, but they know I'm faking it. And women, my
                    God, I had that all the time. I mean, it is funny, but it's tough.</p>
                <p>But I remember they made me the songmaster at Ainsworth. Oh yes, and I'll tell
                    one of my first plays. I almost went into television and Hollywood, and I should
                    have. In 1949, it would have been the ideal time to do it, but I couldn't do it
                    with Mom and Dad up here, the way they were, but it worked out. But anyway, I
                    played Dick Deadeye in H.M.S. Pinafore.</p>
                <p>Q: Another thing that happens in early years is a child learns right from wrong,
                    and sometimes there are some particular moments that really represent that or
                    just really are a big part of learning those things.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. You mean stealing things, and then being caught anthat sort of thing?
                    Well, I never had that problem.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, I'd get bawled out, sure. We'd get in fights, that sort of thing. I'd
                    usually get my tail kicked. I mean, I wasn't very good at it.</p>
                <p>But that was the beautiful thing about Clark Graham, he always would come to my
                    rescue. He was an older guy. I think I admire him as much as I admire any man
                    that's ever lived. And we had a bully in the neighborhood named Lex Barry, and
                    Lex would take us on, and I remember he had a Benjamin pump, they called it, a
                    BB gun, and he'd pump it up as much as you could and let the BBs go at us. Oh,
                    we could have lost an eye or something like that. But Clark every once in a
                    while would take him and just really rattle his cage, and then he'd leave Doug
                    and I alone for a while. I don't know what happened to Lex Barry.</p>
                <p>But it was a good youth. I mean, the thing is, people don't realize the times
                    that we went through, and the communication was - I mean, Jack Armstrong, the
                    all-American boy, was the type of thing we were following, and getting Wheaties
                    that give you a ring or something like that, you could call a spy. (End of
                    tape)</p>
                <p>Snow or something like that, Aunt Bob would take us to a movie. Thschools would
                    close, but you could get down to see a movie for 10 cents.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, I could get downtown. There used to be a Jolly Joan restaurant and
                    there were a lot of that type, but I didn't stick around much for that because -
                    I think a lot of it because I was really campaigning for president of the
                    student body, and I didn't want to get involved with all that. They had
                    zoot-suiters and things like that, which are equivalent to some of the others.
                    There wasn't any dope or anything like that. We didn't have that problem - maybe
                    in the zoot-suiters, that sort of thing.</p>

                <p>GREEN: No, they were about my age, but they just had long -you know, their coats
                    were long, it was a special sort of dress, big wide hats and that sort of thing.
                    Some of them were very talented musicians, as a matter of fact.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. Sure. I didn't pay a lot of attention to them, and I mean, one of
                    them became a good friend of mine, as a matter of fact. I'm trying to think of
                    his name. At that time he was a good friend.</p>

                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>I remember once being in San Francisco, and a guy driving a cab yelled my name,
                    and I did a double-take, and I was coming out of the Clift Hotel, and there was
                    one of those guys. He was driving a cab in San Francisco. So that's what
                    happens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you read in those days? What interests did you
                        have ireading? I mean, back in your childhood.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: We had Big Little Books, read a lot of those. I think that's what they
                    called them, Big Little Books. Flash Gordon type of thing. Not good literature.
                    I mean, we were assigned that, I suppose.</p>
                <p>As I say, there were certain people who were great students. We had - I think his
                    name was Norman Roberts, we would call him the bookworm because he did nothing
                    but read. I mean, you know, he could read through a earthquake and nothing
                    disturbed him. He had that wonderful power of concentration that I've never had.
                    I have it much more now than I did at that time.</p>
                <p>But no, I don't think so. It was just times were just entirely different, that's
                    all. But they were good times, too. They were good times for people if you were
                    not really aware of what was going on in the world. If you, I would think it'd
                    be miserable at my age now and having to go through those things, I mean, unless
                    you had some wealth. And that's really what it comes down to: If you were dirt
                    poor - that would be tough. But if you're young and a kid, you're not aware of
                    it, and it's the time to go through those times. It's the best time to go
                    through those times.</p>
                <p>I remember I used to play the drums. I wasn't any good; I was a terrible drummer.
                    But I used to play them, and how Dad stood it, I don't know. But I'll never
                    forget, I was playing the drums to a radio up in my room, and they interrupted
                    to tell about Pearl Harbor, and I went downstairs and told Dad. And, you know,
                    it was really tough. And then I told Mom, and of course, they immediately were
                    equating my age, which was about 16 at the time, to would I go in, you know,
                    could they lose a son. And I did go in, but 2 years later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were immediately thinking of the possibility.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Sure, as would be perfectly natural. I've often said people my age can
                    remember two things, certainly: Pearl Harbor, and where they were when Kennedy
                    was shot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, so in the years before Pearl Harbor, you weren't
                        veraware, or you were aware of the international crisis that was going
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>GREEN: No, I don't think you were aware. But I remember Pearl Harbor, the day
                    after, somebody drove me downtown or something, going by the Japanese Consulate
                    which was up near the Town Club, and black smoke coming out the chimney. They
                    were burning their records, and that was kind of, I thought, interesting. But
                    you know, you just went on.</p>
                <p>Q: You had mentioned earlier, before we moved further ahead, about your political
                    success in high school. That sounds like a good thing to get a good picture
                    of.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes.</p>
                <p>Q: You were successful in races for political office?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, I ran for offices. “Green or Bear It” - “Get Out of the Red, Get in
                    Green,” and all that sort of thing, you know. And Morrie Mink was the guy I beat
                    in the election. He's a dentist now, I understand, in San Francisco, a wonderful
                    guy - I beat Morrie for student body president. We didn't even have a run-off.
                    And I teased him later, I said, “Morrie, I think you really won, but I was in
                    charge of counting the votes.”</p>
                <p>But I really enjoyed it. We had a man named Harold York who was the principal. A
                    lot of people didn't like him, but I did. You know, he was a good - I knew then
                    - and I was a good student body president; I won the Dad's Club Award, which I
                    don't think they still give, but it was a big thing. It was a tremendous thing
                    for my father. I mean, he just - it was a wonderful thing for him. Well, it's
                    jumping ahead, but I didn't realize how much it meant to him until...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, at the time you weren't that conscious of it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No. I mean, you're conscious of it, but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you try to do? What happened while you were
                        president?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, we had the scrap drive. We won that, beat everybody.And just got
                    things organized that students do and things like that.</p>
                <p>I remember this, I remember somebody - I'd been elected, and apparently I got so
                    intense about the problems of being student body president, getting everything
                    done right, that I forgot to say hello to people, and finally a very good friend
                    of mine - I think it was Wally Haworth is his name - came up and said, “You
                    know, people are talking about you because you're not saying hello to them
                    anymore.”</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>I said, “What do you mean, I'm not saying hello?” “Well, you're not.”</p>
                <p>And I thought about it and I said, “Yes, you're right.”</p>
                <p>So the next day, I started saying hello to people again, and it got okay. But I
                    just got - so you can't do that in elected office. You've got to realize you've
                    got a constituency out there, and you learn that pretty early in life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's a good lesson.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: It was a good lesson; you bet it was a good lesson.</p>
                <p>And then we had all of the student body presidents from all over thcity elected
                    the president of them, and I got elected to that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh really? What was that called, some kind of
                        council?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: President of - yes, a council. And that was a big thrill. tried to tell
                    people about it, but they didn't pay much attention to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you mean, you tried to tell people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I tried to tell them. I said - and a girl named - bad name, last
                    name, Joanne Hoare, was my vice-president, and she got elected the same time. So
                    we were a pretty good team, and I tried to tell people at Lincoln, but they
                    weren't impressed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, that you had gone on to the higher...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Sure. We'd gone on to that higher thing, and you know, maybe we can't beat
                    them in football, but that's -. Well, they didn't care, and I kind of dropped it
                    because I thought it sounded a little braggadocios, which I guess it did, as a
                    matter of fact. A lot of those type people - they make me uncomfortable now, and
                    they certainly did then.</p>
                <p>That's what makes me uncomfortable about this whole thing. I mean, I don't want
                    to appear like I'm bragging or something, and if I sound like an insufferable
                    ass, I want you to tell me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I'm sure to.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>GREEN: Well, you know, I'm doing this because I think my life has been an
                    interesting career. It's got everything in it, most everything in it, and so I'd
                    kind of like to have it down for my family to know and anybody else who might be
                    interested.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, seriously, starting to talk about the importance, which you don't
                    usually talk about, that you actually have had, and the important things in your
                    life, and one has those sort of reservations.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes.</p>
                <p>Q: In this period when you're having your successes in high school, I'm wondering
                    what you're thinking your future is going to be in terms of work and career.
                    You're into work; your father says something about sales. Are there some further
                    thoughts beginning to kind of...</p>
                <p>GREEN: I was scared to death. I think anybody at that age when you start to think
                    about it - number one, you have to realize that the war interfered with all of
                    that. But in high school, I was - well, I tell you one thing I did one summer
                    that really surprised them. They came out with a thing called Lawyers' Liability
                    Insurance. This was after I cleaned up the back room one summer.</p>
                <p>Then I was office boy and things. It was - and I knew I could sell. I mean, I
                    never - “no” doesn't frighten me at all. It doesn't bother me to ask people for
                    money for a good cause. Some people have a very difficult time with that, but it
                    never has bothered me in the least, providing I've given something myself.</p>
                <p>But yes, I was a little frightened. I think we all are. I think there's a stage
                    in your life, you're not sure. I mean, if a fellow wants to be a doctor, or a
                    woman wants to be a doctor or something, they know what they want to do pretty
                    early in life usually, and lawyers. But if it's just a businessman, a salesman,
                    a drummer, that's what I am, and to get the right combination.</p>
                <p>And finally I learned the best thing for me to do is surround myself with people
                    who are strong where I'm weak. If I do that, and see that they have a good piece
                    of the action, everybody's going to prosper very well, and it worked out
                    marvelously for me, and for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did any of that kind of thing start to happen in high
                        school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I think so because I used to - when we'd get a problem or something, I'd
                    go and ask a teacher or something, “How do you handle this sort of thing? What
                    do you do?”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular instances of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I can't really think of any particular instances. You'd have problems with
                    - oh, God, I just - it seems to me when you're a student body president, you
                    know, you've got to appear before the whole student body. You've got to say some
                    things, that sort of thing. But you can't hog it.I remember when Tommy Dorsey
                    was playing at the Paramount Theater, and I was trying to get Tommy Dorsey to
                    come to Lincoln, which is only two blocks away, but everybody else wanted Tommy
                    Dorsey. But I got to be a pretty good friend of Tommy Dorsey's, as a kid, and I
                    almost had him for just...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went and met him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. He was playing at the Paramount Theater at the time. And I said,
                    “Jesus, wouldn't that be great if we could get him up at Lincoln for an
                    assembly? Just bring a few of the players.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You struck up a conversation with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. I went down there and found my way in there and introduced myself
                    and all that. Dick Haynes was the singer, and it was an interesting time in my
                    life. I mean, I've always innovated.</p>
                <p>But those are the things you try to do as student body president. And of course
                    then after my term was up, I guess I was elected a little early because I was
                    still there and Leonard Kaufman was elected president. Then he got sick. So we
                    elected him as president, and I just stayed doing the same things. But Leonard's
                    still around now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I see. You were elected president your senior
                        year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Maybe it's only a six-month thing, or maybe it was the junior year. I
                    don't know. I was pretty popular. And also, you know, this track thing,
                    everybody was expecting me to take the record for Lincoln. That was a big
                    thing.</p>
                <p>Q: Tell me about the track thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>GREEN: Well, it was a quarter mile. A fellow named Jim Doty was the
                    quarter-miler, and this was when I was a sophomore or something, and I was fast.
                    Dad was a track man back in Michigan, and I saw medals that he'd won. And so I
                    went out for the track team, and I've always had a lot of endurance. Jim Doty
                    ran the quarter mile, and he was the guy for Lincoln, and he was good. And I was
                    but two years younger than that, and they needed somebody to give him a race, to
                    pace him. I said, “Well, I'll do it.”</p>
                <p>Well, I went out, and I almost beat him. Dale Scofield was the coach, and he was
                    just absolutely amazed, and that's when he saw that I could do this thing. In
                    this quarter mile, you come off those starting blocks, and you run like it was
                    the 100-yard dash for a quarter of a mile. And I used to have people wait for me
                    at the end and catch me before I fell because I'd give it everything I had. And
                    then I had about 20 or 30 minutes to rest, and then we had the relay team, and I
                    was anchoring the relay team, and we did pretty good, too. But somebody caught
                    me then, too at the end of the race.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How usual was that, for someone to catch a runner at the
                        end?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I don't know, it all depends on how hard they tried. I mean, I knew
                    that I had everything going. I mean, I knew that if I was going to win this
                    race, I had to give it everything, and it was, you know, I was just absolutely -
                    you're coming so fast and so strong to stop. I mean, I've done that. I mean, but
                    I'd scratch myself. Then I'd get sick; sometimes I'd get physically sick.
                    So...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A very concentrated competition.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Very. Very concentrated competition. But I ran the two-milat Stanford and
                    couldn't do a thing. I'd lost my speed.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, what happened?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, the war. I was older, hadn't trained, you know. I was over in New
                    Guinea. That's what everybody's got to realize, before you went to college,
                    you'd gone to the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, the war in between. We'll talk about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: It's everything. I mean, that's a huge portion of my generation's life. A
                    huge portion. But you don't want to talk about that yet?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think we're there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, the war experience that's coming on, your thoughts
                        about it,what you're seeing about the people around you, that kind of
                        experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, there wasn't any hesitancy, we all wanted to go. I was a buck
                    private, and that's as high as I got. Some became officers. At my age - you had
                    to be Clark Graham's age really to get the officer, but at my age, it was -. I
                    tried to be a Marine, but they said, “You've got to eat a lot of carrots.” My
                    eyes weren't good enough. So I was eating a lot of carrots, but I still couldn't
                    get in the Marines, which was probably fortunate because they certainly would
                    have put me onto Iwo Jima or Guadalcanal or something like that.</p>
                <p>But I went down to the University of Oregon for the summer quarter of 1943, I
                    think it was, and I had a wonderful time. Drank. I drank there with a guy named
                    Bill Callahan, who is no longer living. And I came back and I felt so bad about
                    still being there. They put me through the Neighbors of Woodcraft Hall for my
                    physical. And I didn't take the four weeks that you were given - I think it was
                    four weeks, something like that, before you had to report. I just went.</p>
                <p>I went home to Dad and I said, “Dad, I took the thing at Eugene, anI want to go.”
                    And he says, “Okay, I understand.”</p>
                <p>So I went, and as high as I ever got was when they made me acting corporal to
                    take them from here up to Fort Lewis. And the reason I mention it because a
                    little later on, I learned that they had me straightened out all right, but the
                    people that - there were about six of us that went up there on that train - they
                    were ex-convicts and things like that. They weren't about ready to let them go
                    for four weeks; they'd never see them again. So they didn't get that leave
                    thing, and I didn't know at the time their background.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm kind of not understanding. These guys were really
                        ex-cons?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, ex-cons or had done something pretty bad in their life. They weren't
                    about ready to report for duty, so they - I mean, you know, their history showed
                    that, so they just moved them right out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not giving them the period of grace to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: That's right. But Private Green was Acting Corporal Greeand got them
                    there.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>But I went down to Camp Callan, which is a beautiful place in La Jolla right
                    across from the Marine barracks, and that's when my speed was still with me. I
                    remember a five-mile hike we took the Marines on, and we just beat the shit out
                    of the Marines on that hike. Yes, and I was running at the end of it.</p>
                <p>God, the officer gave me a day off, and I went into San Diego and did all the
                    things that single young men do in those days. It was terrific, and I became
                    kind of a celebrity at that camp because nobody thought the Army was going to
                    beat the Marines. We just - we had some good guys down there, and I became a
                    meteorologist, so to speak. They called me a theodolite observer; on the back of
                    my civilian conversion it said theodolite observer. We were scheduled to go into
                    the Philippines, and I was the guy that was going to release the balloons so
                    they could get the azimuth and the elevation for the anti-aircraft. Now, if you
                    were a Japanese defending the Philippines and we were storming the shore, who
                    would you shoot first? Wouldn't you shoot the guy that's letting the balloons
                    off? I mean, he's got to stand out a little bit different.</p>
                <p>But anyway, I got in a truck accident, and...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's see, how fast did you get over there? You went from
                        thicamp in California?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: In California, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About what date was that? Can you date it
                        approximately?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, let's see, probably '44.</p>
                <p>I know when I was on Goodenough Island, which was a replacement camp off New
                    Guinea, that the war in Europe had just ended, and that was a big thing. And
                    then I went to Finchaven, New Guinea. And then coming back from a movie, a truck
                    picked me up and gave me a ride back, and there was a bad crash, and I lost -
                    oh, I got they call aphasia. They had to go in and take my bones out of my - I
                    couldn't talk - bones out of the brain, I guess. And then they came in on this
                    side, and I was awake the whole time. It was awful.</p>
                <p>And they had a Dr. Campbell there, Major Campbell, who was one of the best
                    surgeons in the world on this thing. I lucked out, got the right guy at
                    Finchaven. They also had a nurse named Miss Dee who liked me a lot, but I was a
                    private and she was a lieutenant - but God, she was pretty</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>And then I remember Carol Landis came through. Carol Landis was a beautiful
                    actress that subsequently died. Jack Benny was over there, and we had a guy
                    named Leo who was in the bed right next to me, and the other bed next to me was
                    a fellow with more tattoos, and then it ends up that he's a tattoo guy in the
                    circus. He was a nice guy, but Jesus, he had tattoos.</p>
                <p>But anyway, Leo got hit in the head, and it was a bad wound up there. Carol
                    Landis came through, and she had a low-slung dress on, and all of us dropped
                    something by our bed, and she was very nice about it, and there was a colonel
                    with her with a pistol, so that if anybody tried to do something - and anyway,
                    Carol Landis would lean down to pick it up and you could imagine the exposure to
                    the guys that hadn't seen anything that beautiful for a long, long time.</p>
                <p>But the reason I tell you the story is that Leo died that night, but Leo died
                    with a big smile on his face because I was looking at him when he died. I said,
                    “He's going, but he's got a smile on his face,” and that was wonderful.</p>
                <p>Then I went back to San Francisco. I mean, the ship, they paid us off before we
                    left New Guinea, and I got in a crap game the last night out, and I won a lot of
                    money, five, six hundred dollars. It was a lot of money at that time. And I
                    excused myself from the crap game and went upstairs and hid until we got off the
                    ship. I told them I was coming back, I had no intention of going back, and I got
                    off the ship okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did that because...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I thought they might go after the money. That was a lot of dough, and so
                    anyway I got off the ship okay. We went to the Letterman's Hospital. I called
                    Dad from San Francisco, and he couldn't talk. He was just so startled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He heard about your - had they been notified?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. I tried to write him a letter explaining it to him, and they kept the
                    letter, thank God. And they showed it to me. They said, “We want to keep it to
                    show an example of...,” you know. This is when I was - uh, uh, uh - talking like
                    this. I couldn't do it. That was one of my main concerns.</p>
                <p>Q: What did they tell you was going to happen to you? I mean, when you started
                    getting the news about your condition, what was the prognosis that you
                    heard?</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>GREEN: They - and I agreed to stay over there a little while longer, because once
                    the pressure came off, I could talk. I remember, on the second operation, when
                    the pressure came out, and they were carrying me across a field back to the
                    hospital, Major Campbell was with me, and he said, “How do you feel?” I said, “I
                    feel marvelous.” Just like that, I said it, and I said, “My God, I said that,
                    Major!” and I sat up in the stretcher. He said, “You stay right where you are,
                    young man.” But I could talk; I mean, it was a thrill.</p>
                <p>But then I went to McCaw General Hospital in Walla Walla near Whitman, where they
                    put the plate in this side. And then I asked them, I said - a Major Paul Bailey
                    was from Portland, and he knew me - Dr. Bailey, eye, ear, nose and throat.
                    Marvelous man, and his wife, they were in - he was serving at McCaw. So he
                    really befriended me, and I guess I can say this on tape, if you want to take it
                    off, but I think it's a funny story.</p>
                <p>I said to the doctor in charge up there, I said, “Doctor, I really don't want to
                    be a coward, but I don't think I can take this thing again.” I mean, I'd lost
                    all my fillings out of my teeth, you know. It was just awful. And I said, “Is
                    there any way you can put me out?” He said, “Well, would you sign a document?” I
                    said, “Yes, I'll sign anything.”</p>
                <p>So anyway, I did, and so they gave me sodium Pentothal for this final operation,
                    and I counted to 100, and I started counting backward, and that's how pepped up
                    I was on that one. And then apparently when you're coming out of this thing,
                    it's kind of like being drunk, I guess, and apparently, they let doctors,
                    military doctors know throughout the West Coast that this was happening to this
                    Private Green up here, because it was - well, not medical history, but you're
                    operating that close to the brain, and it's about a four- or five-hour
                    operation, six hours maybe, I don't know - a long one and a tough one, and they
                    hadn't put a person out for this sort of thing.</p>
                <p>So the nurse leans over, and all these doctors are there, to get a sample of my
                    urine, and I apparently was coming out of it, and I apparently said to the
                    nurse, I said, “Madam, what do you think I am, a faucet you can turn on and off
                    at will?” and Dr. Bailey, he says, “I know this young man. He's going to be just
                    fine.” That's a true story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, that's good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, a true story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that first operation like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, boy. I mean, the toughest was putting the plates in. The other was
                    just - they would just grind, you know, but you can't feel anything, you just
                    hear everything. It's all by your ear you know, it's just awful. It's awful.
                    It's tough.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it pain or the psychological shock or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: There was a lot of pain and a lot of psychological shock, yes, a great
                    deal.But then I stayed over a couple of weeks because Miss Dee asked me to stay
                    over; we became friends, but she asked me to talk to other soldiers that were
                    coming in wounded in the head, you know, because I was a pretty good example of
                    recovered head injury. And I said I would.</p>
                <p>I remember vividly they were coming through and tossing a Purple Heart on my bed,
                    and I said, “What's this for?” and they said, “Well, you know, you got...” I
                    just said, “I was hurt, I wasn't wounded,” and tossed it back to them and said,
                    “No, don't give me a Purple Heart,” because I'd heard about some friends of mine
                    that had been killed, wounded, you know. I'm not trying to overdo it, but I
                    think it would be very phony for me to wear a Purple Heart. I'd be very
                    uncomfortable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you gave it back...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they actually retrieve it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: yes, and then he just went on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're still on the records as a recipient of the Purple

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, I'm not.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, you're not?</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, you didn't get on the record? GREEN: No. No, I said,
                        “Take me off.”</hi>

                <p>GREEN: I think the Philippines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And did you hear what happened to the rest of the company

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, that's a good question. No, I didn't. We were replacements. It wasn't
                    exactly as though you were - Goodenough Island was a replacement island, and if
                    somebody was hurt or killed or something like that, they had people who would go
                    in from there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Not first ashore.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: So you didn't really go over with the Fighting Fourth osomething like
                    that. It wasn't your platoon.</p>
                <p>Q: As you got farther into it, there's the initial thing of the induction
                    process, and then you're going overseas, you're saying goodbye to your family.
                    What's the progression of your experiencing this, say in terms of fear and
                    wonder about what's going to happen to you?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I'm a great believer in if your time's come, it's come. I think at
                    that age - you know, when you're 18 years of age, you're immortal. You don't
                    think about it. That was brought out in Private Ryan. You just hit that beach,
                    and you don't think the bullet's going to hit you. You just don't think about it
                    at 18. Oh, sure, you think about it, you're not a fool, but it's “Nah, nah, nah,
                    it's not going to happen to me.”Q: In people around you, did you see fear coming
                    on in people?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, some. But not much, no. I mean, most of us were there to just get this
                    damn thing over with and get home. We were in a lousy part of the world,
                    too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You remember the Philippines?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I didn't go to the Philippines. I went to the Philippines later with the
                    Port of Portland. No, I just got to New Guinea. I didn't even get to
                    Australia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, New Guinea and Goodenough Island is...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Off New Guinea.</p>
                <p>Q: So when you came back to the States, you were in pretty bad shape. You were in
                    Walla Walla and finally got released from the hospital, and then what happened
                    next?</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>GREEN: Then I came home, came to Portland and went to work for Dooly &amp;
                    Company. At this time in my life, Mabel Livingston was my secretary at Dooly
                    &amp; Company and we celebrated VJ-Day together. It was really something. I
                    received a phone call. The City of Portland was celebrating very strongly the
                    victory and Mr. Livingston called me at the office and asked that I get Mabel to
                    a bus to take her home safely, so after we threw a few rolls of toilet paper on
                    the street in celebration from the third floor of the Board of Trade Building, I
                    took Mabel by hand and kissed every girl I could kiss on the way to the bus,
                    gave Mabel a kiss and put her on the bus to go home to her father, then I
                    disappeared into a very raucous evening.</p>
                <p>Took the Stanford examination and completed about half of it, and the rest was
                    math, and I said, “If you want somebody's that proficient in math, don't take
                    me.”Q: You wrote that on the...</p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. But you've got to realize the circumstances. The war with Japan was
                    still on, and I had a little - they call them ruptured ducks on your lapel,
                    which means that you were a serviceman, you've done your duty, you were injured
                    or hurt or something like that, so that you're not a slacker, in other words,
                    you know. And so I got Public Law number 16 for college. Now, Public Law number
                    16 is for people who were hurt while they were in service. With Public Law
                    number 16, you got - no matter what the tuition was, it was paid. Didn't make
                    any difference what it was, what the books cost, it didn't make any difference.
                    Plus you got $135 a month. And Dad sent me - at that time things were getting
                    better for them - they sent me $35. So I had $170 income a month at
                    Stanford.</p>
                <p>Room and board at the Phi Delta Theta house was 65 bucks. Beer was a dime; mixed
                    drinks were 40 cents. Model A car. It was wonderful. No wife, no responsibility.
                    I always had $20 or $30 left over at the end of the month. And it was a great
                    life. That's the reason - being fortunate, why, I've been generous to Stanford,
                    and one reason is I got a free ride through this place. You paid for it, the
                    taxpayers paid for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you happen to choose Stanford? How did that come
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, it was just a lark taking the test. I thought I was going to Oregon.
                    Matter of fact, Maurie Dooly was madder than hell at me for not going for Oregon
                    because he thought I was going to be in insurance, I should get to know people
                    in Oregon. But I said, “No, I've got a chance to go there, let me just take the
                    test. I'm not going to pass it. Don't worry about it.”</p>
                <p>Well, the circumstances were such that they were taking anybody, particularly a
                    guy like me because they were going to get full tuition, everything out of
                    me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you know other people who were going to Stanford?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, sure. Clark Graham went to Stanford, and I went Phi Delbecause he was
                    a Phi Delt. I knew a lot of people at Stanford.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems like it was kind of a favorite for sons of
                        Oregon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: A lot of people I know went to Stanford. I think it's wonderful school.
                    It's changed a lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What have you done down at U of O? You had just a short
                        summer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, summer quarter of 1943. Just 12 units, just had a loof fun and no
                    responsibilities whatsoever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Got a taste of college life.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: You can imagine. Well, and the 12 units helped me at Stanford. I'd slip
                    them in every once a while. It gave me a little leg up. It's like a guy being
                    elected congressman a week earlier than the other people. It gives them a little
                    seniority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you majored in political science at Stanford?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, I majored in political science.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, I think probably it was just the most understandable one for me. I
                    mean, I agree with Dad. I thought that I would be out doing something, selling
                    or something, and that's where this was.</p>
                <p>The surprising thing, of course, I found fascinating down at Stanford was
                    business law, and I got good grades. I almost, - what happened was I flunked the
                    mid-term. Geez, I couldn't let that happen. I hadn't worked on it. So I really
                    studied for the final, the last six weeks or so, and I wrote an examination that
                    got me an A, so I got a C for the course.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>And one piece of advice - and if any lawyer reads this, he's not going to like
                    this, but one piece of advice I got down there was from an upperclassman that
                    said, “Well, Punch, what you do in law is you write the answer to the question,
                    and don't put a period there. Put the word 'because' and go ahead and re-answer
                    it again. Then put a period. That way, you're writing a longer thing. You're
                    probably right in your short answer, but the law professor isn't going to like
                    it.”</p>
                <p>So all through life, if I had to - I'd put the word “because” and gback and say
                    it again to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To clarify it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, it doesn't clarify. It's bull. But you know, it makeyou look
                    good.</p>
                <p>Q: To continue, I was interested in hearing what the atmosphere was, and the
                    intellectual atmosphere. I think Stanford, and you were just mentioning it, was
                    a pretty liberal place. And so how did that strike you?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, it wasn't that liberal at that time. I graduated in 1949. We started
                    to run into that, but we had a President Sterling, who was just a magnificent
                    man from Canada, and the school would run across problems and Sterling faced
                    them down.</p>
                <p>But you didn't have religious far right type of things and extremes like -
                    Vietnam brought a lot of this on, and this was all before. So all schools have
                    gone through this, and I know certain Stanford graduates now that won't
                    contribute because they think it's way too far left, whatever that means, and I
                    don't - I'm jumping ahead of myself, but maybe I've become more moderate because
                    of the experience I had in Europe, too. I think I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That will really be interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, we'll talk about that.</p>
                <p>But Stanford - it was four years in the Phi Delt house, where I made a lot of
                    good friends, and all over the campus. I never got involved in politics down
                    there. I wanted the freedom. I knew that when I graduated that I was going to
                    have to really put my tail into it you know, I knew I was going to have to
                    really go at it. And so I just had the carefree time of it. I took my Dad
                    literally, what he said.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>Matter of fact, my roommate, this guy named Bob Forbes, for a long time, he's in
                    Southern California, we called him Boozy Bob and I was Alcohol Al, so that will
                    show you something in the future, you know. He was calling me Alky, and I was
                    calling him Boozy. Well, we didn't have a problem. I didn't have a problem then.
                    I mean, I could shut her off or take her in. I don't know, it just caught up
                    with me later on. But I am sure that a lot of people that knew me at Stanford
                    are very surprised. I don't blame them, either. I would be, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Surprised at -?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I hate to use the word success - you know, that I just wouldn't have
                    dropped out. Because I mean, I wasn't the world's most responsible person. I
                    didn't want to be. I didn't have any girlfriends there. I didn't want any.Then,
                    Joanie, my wife, I met - I just happened to see her. I had a date broken, and I
                    was in San Francisco. I've known her all her life, and she's a twin. Matter of
                    fact, I took her twin sister, Jean, out a few times before I took Joanie out.
                    But Joanie was walking on Union Square in San Francisco.</p>
                <p>And I hailed her, and she came over, and I said, “Are you doing anything
                    tonight?” I said, “I've been stood up,” and she said, “No.” And that's the kind
                    of woman she was.</p>
                <p>And so we went to the Patent Leather Room at the Saint Francis Hotel, and I had
                    about six or seven dollars on me, but you could get a beer for 25 cents. The
                    Iron Pot, we went for dinner, and for a dollar we'd get a wonderful meal. The
                    first drink I ordered for Joan was one beer and two straws, and she loved it. I
                    mean, she wasn't putting it on, she loved it. And I said, “God, this girl's...”
                    I mean, I wasn't thinking about marriage, though. I didn't want to get married.
                    But anyway, I'm glad - as I indicated at the start, it was the smartest thing I
                    ever did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of the surprise of the moment was a big part of
                        it,re-encountering her.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. Oh, yes. Yes, it was. She gets mad at me sometimes - well, we can
                    talk about this later. Our interest levels - I mean, she's a bridge player and
                    all that. She wants me to get more involved in golf, and why don't I like golf?
                    Well, I don't play good golf - 28 handicap - Imagine!.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She does?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, but she's a lousy golfer, too. I mean, she's not a very good golfer.
                    She's a good bridge player, but she's not a good golfer. She's a terrible
                    golfer. But she's one of these people that come back at it and have a good time.
                    I don't have a good time when I don't do it well.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What had she thought of you in high school? She must have
                        told you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, we took some classes together. Joanie had braces on her teeth. Both
                    Joan and Jean had braces on their teeth, and they used to think one of the
                    funniest things they could do would be to take the rubber bands they've got on
                    the braces, you know, and some poor guy sitting in front, let the rubber bands
                    back and go and hit someone in the neck. The guy didn't know what had hit him. I
                    used to watch that sort of thing. If anybody said I was going to marry one of
                    those two, I think I would have argued with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how did this progress, then, after this meeting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, after that, sometimes I'd get a place where I had to have a date,
                    and so I'd call her up and she'd come down. She had a nice car; as I say, Joanie
                    had some wealth. Her father took care of her very well, and her sister. And it
                    just kind of occurred to me that - I was going back to Palo Alto, the bus depot
                    or the train depot, one of the two, and it was late getting back. And I said to
                    Joan - and I've often claimed in 50 years, that I never really did propose. I
                    said, “You wouldn't want to get married, would you?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And she said...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: She said, “Yes,” and then I tried to break it a couple of times. Then she
                    tried to break it a couple of times. Then we finally...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened when you tried to break it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, she said, “Fine,” but she was hurt deeply. I was afraid to get
                    married. It wasn't her. I was afraid to get married. How was I going to support
                    anything? And her sister had married a wealthy man. They're since divorced, and
                    it's too bad, it was a tough divorce, but at that time - and I said, “Joan, I
                    don't have a dime, and your sister, your identical twin sister has married one
                    of the wealthiest guys in town.” I said it just won't work, I'm selling
                    insurance, God, I want to sell him insurance. It just won't work.</p>
                <p>But it did work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You understood about your feelings at the time, it was all
                        prettclear to you so that you talked about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, yes. It wasn't a mad, passionate thing. I mean, there wasn't anything
                    calculated about it. I didn't marry her for her money. I had a chance to marry
                    wealth at Stanford. That is one tough way to make a living. I was just scared
                    stiff of marriage. I mean, I don't know what I was going to do with Mother and
                    Father. I didn't know - Henri Labbe wasn't any help.</p>
                <p>The whole thing - as I said, I had an older friend that got an Oscar award for
                    film editing, he got me a job offer to start in one of the theaters in Los
                    Angeles as an usher. That's where a lot of guys started, in 1949, in TV. You
                    know, it would have been a marvelous time to do it, if I could have. Of course,
                    what with booze, what with - but I just couldn't see where I could do it because
                    who was going to take care of things up here? And I wasn't going to get paid
                    anything for a while.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Still very young - 24?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, well, I'd been through the war, and I was 24. You're right. You've
                    got to realize the war matured a lot of us a lot more - when we were going
                    through school, we were far more mature than most people. You could see it right
                    after the war was over, the kids coming right out of high school and going to
                    school, and then the guys coming back. And we'd rush, fraternity rushing, and
                    some of these guys were just magnificent at what they'd been through, and then
                    this fuzzy little guy would come along - not his fault, but he was just three or
                    four years younger. He hadn't anywhere near the experience.</p>
                <p>I remember once a guy named Paul Stremick, big guy. We thought he was going to be
                    a big football player. He didn't turn out too well as a player. But the little
                    guy named Tom Schauver wanted to paddle Paul Stremick. Paul had been through the
                    war, Iwo Jima and everything, and he said, “What?” He turned him up and put him
                    against the wall, and he said, “You're going to paddle me?” That was
                    dropped.</p>
                <p>But that was the atmosphere. I could have - you know, I say I'm class of '49, and
                    that's when I graduated, but '48 or '50 would have been okay, too, because we
                    all knew each other, we all intermixed. But it was a different world.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The date today is the 27th of April, 1999. The interviewer
                        iJim Strassmaier for the Oregon Historical Society.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>On the things that I wanted to get back to starting out today, there were some
                    names of individuals who were important to you, but probably the best place to
                    begin is with the really most central people to you, your parents. And I think a
                    good question, after thinking back over your lifetime, is what do you think you
                    learned from your parents?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I think both of them supported me all the way. They had problems,
                    and they had some personal problems - and they should have, as I've mentioned, I
                    think, on the previous tape that going from rich to poor is a very tough
                    journey, and a lot of things happened. Some people did gather around, and I
                    think that's been mentioned, too.</p>
                <p>But, you know, they were always supportive of me. I loved them dearly, and I've
                    mentioned Dad's death and how he prolonged himself to help science. And then
                    Mother, Joan, my wife Joan, I think she loved my mother as much as she loved her
                    own. Mom lived at the Vista St. Clair, and she died there, and I've always
                    thought that the Vista St. Clair is one of the great places in the world. The
                    way they treated Mother was just fantastic.</p>
                <p>But I was very, very proud of her, and she was very proud of me, and that made it
                    very nice. I think she was amazed, and so was I and a lot of other people. But
                    it did work out.</p>
                <p>And then a name that has to be foremost is that of Maurie Dooly. Iwas Dooly &amp;
                    Company. Do you want me to sing you the ditty that we...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Sure, we'd sing the ditty, we did at the Dooly &amp; Company Christmas
                    party; his name has always been misspelled, and he spent a lot of money on
                    advertising and it used to upset him. It was something like this from the
                    Christmas party. It's very short: “D-o-o-l-e-y, we've misspelled a name. Who
                    gives a damn if we can't spell, if the premiums are the same?”</p>
                <p>That was a real team down there. They had marvelous men, and I think if I'd
                    stayed, probably I would have had - Ferry Smith didn't have any children - no, I
                    think he did have a daughter. He had a daughter. Ferry, F-e-r-r-y. He was
                    president of Multnomah Club, as a matter of fact, at one time. But I think I
                    probably would have taken over that practice of his. I don't know. But I was
                    getting a pretty good practice of my own, so it really didn't make much
                    difference. I'll tell you later on why I left.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>But in the early years, I used to just delight in going down there and watching
                    these guys as they went at it. And the support women were just fantastic. And
                    this is before, of course, the automatic typewriters and things of that sort. I
                    remember Harry S. Grannatt. Do you remember that name?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, Harry S. Grannatt used to write a poem in the Oregon Journal, every
                    day, I think. H.S.G. It was marvelous. He was a brilliant man, and he had the
                    biggest insurance coverage or had the biggest client. It was the newspapers all
                    over the country, it was the strike insurance policy, as I recall.</p>
                <p>Anyway, he was a stickler about his letters, and if one word was misspelled in
                    this four, five page letter, his poor secretary had to type it all over again.
                    It wasn't the way they do it anymore. And it was amazing. I used to watch her. I
                    can't remember her name, but she had to redo that thing.</p>
                <p>But they would go in, and they'd play cards as soon as work was over. And Art
                    McArthur who is an old name around here, and he and I have always been friends
                    right from the start, and Art was kind of my first boss. He was the office boy.
                    I remember once Art was working on something down there, and a little late, say,
                    seven or eight o'clock, and Mr. Dooly had a - I called him Uncle Maurie after
                    work or in privacy, but it was always “Mr. Dooly” at work. And he wasn't an
                    uncle of mine, but God, he was a great friend.</p>
                <p>Anyway, he went into Dooly &amp; Company, and there was Art typing something, and
                    he had a bottle of whiskey that he was drinking, too. And Mr. Dooly, typical of
                    him, said, “Art, that's not very good whiskey you're drinking.” In other words,
                    “I don't think you should be drinking it here.” And Art looked at him and said,
                    “Mr. Dooly, there's no such thing as a bad whiskey,” and he went right on. And
                    Mr. Dooly agreed with him and, I think, went right on and probably had a belt
                    with him.</p>
                <p>He used to take me out for renewals, little renewals, maybe ten, fifteen dollars
                    - dwelling, fire insurance, and I'd go to these places, knock on their door when
                    we didn't hear from these people, and get the renewals and that sort of thing.
                    And then he and I would go to see a baseball game or something, a high school
                    game or anything. He loved that stuff.</p>
                <p>And you know, his wife was a very good friend of my mother's, and she died early,
                    and then Uncle Maurie and Mom became very close. I was kind of hoping that maybe
                    something more permanent might be arranged, but the circumstances weren't right
                    for it, so it didn't happen. But they were very happy, the two of them. And they
                    were just a kick together because Uncle Maurie couldn't hear, either. He could
                    turn his hearing aid off.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>This is a wonderful story. Hawthorne K. Dent established the General Insurance
                    Company, and Uncle Maurie Dooly put some money into it. He made more money on
                    that than he ever made out of Dooly &amp; Company. He'd never admit that, but
                    it's true. I think it's true, let's put it that way.</p>
                <p>But in the old days businesses would - you could put a large sum of money in a
                    bank and put it in a savings account type of thing, and then every three months,
                    the interest would be declared on that money, and then a lot of them released
                    the checks, they'd get to keep the interest. Now, Uncle Maurie dearly loved
                    that. And Hawthorne K. Dent, I remember once being in the office, and I looked
                    at him - and they were all glass-enclosed offices. It was down in the Board of
                    Trade Building in Portland, about the third floor. I looked up and Hawthorne K.
                    Dent was emperor of the world as far as insurance goes in the Northwest, but
                    Dooly &amp; Company was the best customer he had, too, sold more insurance then
                    than anybody for General, and the check for the General Insurance Company was
                    right on Maurie Dooly's desk. And Hawthorne K. Dent would point to it, and you'd
                    see his hand going up and down, and I'd see Uncle Maurie go back with his big
                    grin and turn him off with his hearing aid, and he couldn't hear a word he said.
                    But just as soon as the date was met at the bank, off went the check, and it was
                    probably in the hundred thousand dollar range, and in those days that was just
                    huge. It's not bad now, as a matter of fact, as far as I'm concerned.</p>
                <p>But anyway, so that's kind of Maurie Dooly. I have mentioned, I know, Frank
                    McCaslin. It wasn't that he had much to do with my life, but he did something
                    for me that I've never forgotten.</p>
                <p>I went to school at Stanford with his son, and we became very, very close
                    friends, and he gave me - the liability insurance, he had me look at it, and
                    then I wrote it, for Oregon Portland Cement Company, and that meant an awful lot
                    to me because, you see, my father-in-law, Howard Irwin had given me his business
                    - and he has to be emphasized, Howard Irwin, but that's not my youth. I mean,
                    that's a little later.</p>
                <p>But I tell you who has to be also mentioned is Adrian Graham. He was, that's
                    Braley and Graham Buick. And he was my godfather, and my godmother is Roberta
                    Graham, and she's still alive, a hundred and one years old. I saw her just three
                    weeks ago, and she's marvelous. But they were the first people to give me a pair
                    of pants, I mean, a long pair of pants. They did a lot of kind things for me
                    when I was young. Their son, Doug, was my best friend, after Bumps Duthie, who I
                    mentioned, I think, earlier, who died. And then Clark Graham, of course, was
                    always my hero. And right now as I talk to you, and I'm 74 years old, or will be
                    May 1st, Clark Graham's still my hero. He is. I mean, I'd do anything for the
                    memory of that man. I think he was outstanding.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>And then Allen Meier is - I mention him because Roger Meier is probably as close
                    a friend as possible - Roger Meier and Gordon Grout, Roger Madden. Jim Stevens
                    died. But we were as close, I suppose, as you can get. I mean, we've got roots
                    that just go back to before Ainsworth School together, and we're still around.
                    We're still talking to each other and having a lot of fun with each other. And
                    the Meiers were the only ones that seemed to have much real money, and that was
                    Meier &amp; Frank, of course, and they had a swimming pool. And I think I
                    mentioned this on a previous tape, but we would go and swim there and things
                    like that.</p>
                <p>Allen Meier also made the arrangement for me to get that first job at the
                    receiving warehouse for $40 a month or something, and you know, I always
                    remember that. You know, since I've started doing this thing, you start thinking
                    about these things that you don't think about. But they are a key thing. What if
                    he hadn't done that, and that sort of thing. He didn't have to do that at
                    all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any lessons that you learned from Maurie Dooly that you
                        can callessons?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, sure. He taught me a lot of things. “Work the room, Al,” he'd always
                    say - or Sam; he called me Sam. And I still work the room. I've been a
                    relatively successful person, but I still work the room - trying to make sure
                    everybody knows you're at Dooly &amp; Company Insurance, that's what it amounted
                    to. I mean, he was just fantastic. He was one of the great salesmen in the
                    world, totally honest, and loved it, just absolutely adored it. It was like a
                    stage to him. You see enthusiasm like that and, of course, you succeed.</p>
                <p>I never will forget, I was a quarter-miler and about as fast as anybody in town.
                    And the war, I was just a kid, and they came out with a war renewal something or
                    other - it wasn't expensive, but it had to be attached to a policy. And the
                    certificates were very tough to get. And we had to beat Jewett Barton Leavy
                    &amp; Kern and Cole, Clark and Cunningham. Jewett Barton was right across the
                    street. And I said to Mr. Dooly - and the state office was about four blocks up
                    - and I said, “When are they going to be open?” They were going to be open at
                    noon. I said, “Why don't you let me go up there, and I'll get them?” I mean, I'm
                    a little kid, but I said, “I can get them back here. Nobody can beat me at that
                    distance in the city. I'll get them back here before anybody.”</p>
                <p>“Well, don't you drop anything.” You know, they were scared to deatthat I might
                    do something. I said, “I won't.”</p>
                <p>And so I went up there, and by God, I was first in line and got them, what they
                    wanted, and I tell you, I never - I'm sure I broke the record of getting back to
                    Dooly &amp; Company and then getting it to them, and they were all patting me on
                    the back. We beat Jewett Barton and Kern to get them incorporated in the various
                    policies that Dooly &amp; Company had. It was just - you know.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, I had to pick them up in the Oregon Building. It was about three or
                    four blocks up, at some state office. But Mabel Bishop, who is Mort Bishop's
                    wife, Mabel Livingston at the time, she was with me when the war was over, but
                    you don't want to get into that right now, do you? Is that another stage, or are
                    we there?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's stay with a little detail on the high school years.
                        Yowere working for Maurie while you were still in high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. Meier &amp; Frank and then Dooly, yes. I would say started about 14,
                    something like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The first things you did were office type things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. Dooly had a back office. They had a back room, which was just a mess.
                    Everybody wore hats in those days, so I put on a tie and shirt, and I found a
                    green hat with green feather in it. So I went down with the big boys, and as
                    soon as I get in, I go to the back room and take off my hat, the green hat.</p>
                <p>But I will tell you one thing, at the end of the summer, that back room was in
                    the best shape it's ever been in. And I took Mr. Dooly back there and Art
                    McArthur, and I said, “Just take a look at this thing.” And by God, they
                    couldn't believe it.</p>
                <p>I am that kind of a guy. I've been known to talk long distance and look at a
                    picture that's askew and it's just driving me crazy, and I say, “Excuse me,” and
                    go over and fix the picture. I mean, it's just the way - I think I get that from
                    my mother. She was like that. But I just can't help it.</p>

                <p>GREEN: Yes, it does that. I don't know why it does that sometimes.Is that better

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, it sounds you like you were graduating in pretty
                        definitstages...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, it was. They had me - well, this was in college days,but yes, I was
                    gradually -.</p>
                <p>Then they made me office boy when I came back, and Arthur was working on it and
                    things like that.They were wonderful days. I didn't realize it but they were,
                    but you know, you never do know until -. Everything looks better when you look
                    back. Actually, they were terrible days. Depression days, and wars, things like
                    that. But they had an awful lot of interesting things happening at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>Q: What did you find difficult? Did you experience any real setbacks or
                    challenges in this work as a kid? I'm thinking of high school days.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Not really. I've always been a very optimistic type of person. I am now.
                    And I just - oh, I'm sure we had some times - I mean, I ran into some awful
                    times in business, but that's -. I wrote a name down here that actually saved
                    me. But in those days, no, I was just having a lot of fun, and I loved the
                    people I was with, and I admired them. They were all outgoing people. I'm kind
                    of, I suppose, an outgoing person, too, and they're just easier to get along
                    with. This is beside the subject, but I can tell you that I've dealt a lot with
                    alcoholism in my youth and in my life, from a professional standpoint, too, and
                    somebody who's an extrovert's a hell of a lot easier to take care of than an
                    introvert. An introvert keeps it all to himself, and it's tough.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your experience in learning to sell? Are there
                        stageof...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No. That's an interesting question. You don't, I don't think - I think
                    it's something you just have in you. I don't think that you can just go to
                    school and learn to sell. Have you ever seen some of these people who go to
                    these speech classes, and after you've sat there for a while, you can tell
                    they've been to a speech school. I mean, their hands go up at the right time.
                    They make a box, and all that. And it's just - I think you have to have
                    imagination. They call it rainmaking nowadays, and that's the guy they're going
                    to pay is the rainmaker. And I think that's one who they should pay. He's the
                    guy that brings the business in, providing it's good business and the business
                    can pay. There are plenty of people that, you know, are successful, very
                    successful. I mean, that's - you know, a teacher, a really good teacher is a
                    fantastic salesman. Selling isn't just moving a product. Selling is yourself,
                    and selling involves all sorts of things, I think, aside from just - and you can
                    make an awfully good living selling, if you're good. And no matter whether times
                    are good or not, you just come up with different ideas, and it's energy, and you
                    don't worry about eight hours. That's ridiculous. You just have a good time and
                    go out and do it, and kind of pit yourself against the world. But you know
                    you've got a good team behind you. That's everything.</p>

                        experience...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No. It was just something I kind of naturally came to. I don't know if I'd
                    have had the experience if I'd stayed at Meier &amp; Frank in the receiving
                    room, taking china out of a barrel, whether I would have developed into a
                    salesman. I don't know; I have a feeling I probably would have. But I had a lot
                    of confidence as I got older and older because I would sell a bit at Dooly &amp;
                    Company. They let me go out and sell.</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact, one summer - and this was in college, but I had proved to
                    them - I found lawyer's liability insurance, and nobody was pushing it. So I
                    read it pretty well, and I saw every lawyer in town, and I made some big sales
                    to big attorneys. What was against me was my youth. I'm a kid, and I'm talking
                    to the chief lawyer, this is their field, and I had to have all of these answers
                    for them because, you know, this is what they do. They like papers like
                    insurance policies. But I got them, and we were the only ones that were pushing
                    it.</p>
                <p>I do remember when I left and was going back to my final year at Stanford, they
                    were pretty serious about it. Dooly &amp; Company said, “What are you planning
                    on doing?” I said, “Well, I don't know.” At that time I wasn't engaged to Joan
                    or anything, and I said, “I just haven't thought too much about it.” I was
                    thinking a little bit about going into this new thing called television, but I
                    didn't tell them that. And then, you know, other things happened.</p>
                <p>But they wanted me back badly because I had proven to them I coulsell. I'll never
                    forget that experience. And it was a lot of fun.</p>

                <p>GREEN: Well, yes. It was. Because I get terribly bored reading something like
                    that. That's the reason I kind of like fiction rather than nonfiction. I just
                    get bored reading that stuff. And then a lot of it was boilerplate, but there
                    were a few really key phrases in there that gave them the real protection that
                    they were looking for, and they wouldn't believe it. So I had a policy, and I
                    had it all made up, and I underlined the words. I said, “No, here it is, right
                    in writing.” And it was backed by a good company, too, like Firemen's Fund or
                    General or something like that. So it wasn't some fly-by-night company. It was
                    all brand new. I mean, now no lawyer would dare practice without lawyers'
                    liability insurance, I don't think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The companies Dooly &amp; Company handled, they handled
                        the olHartford Company...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, that was a big one. General Insurance Company was thbig one, and
                    Firemen's Fund was big. They had a lot of them, you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the competition fierce?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes, they were always there. But that shouldn't bother people. I think
                    competition - if they're cheaper, there's a reason they're cheaper, and you've
                    got to find out why they're cheaper. Either you're getting too rich, or they're
                    not giving you something. I didn't think we were getting too rich, so we had to
                    search out and find out - sometimes they say they'd give you something, and they
                    weren't giving you anything.</p>
                <p>Insurance doesn't mean a thing unless you have a claim. Otherwise, you might as
                    well have a blank sheet of paper. But if you've got a claim and they pay the
                    claim, that's what you buy insurance for. I'm very careful, even now at my age,
                    about putting in a claim on an insurance policy, and I pay a lot of money for
                    insurance, because I didn't buy the insurance for that reason. I bought it for
                    the major claims, and if I nickel and dime them - I used to have one customer
                    that said he was always going to make money on his insurance. I said, “By nickel
                    and diming and things like that, so that you've spent $500 a year and you
                    collect $600 in claims?” I said, “You're not a customer of mine.” I let him go.
                    I'm very careful about it, particularly with automobile insurance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you quit there before you married?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, I was there. I was at Dooly &amp; Company when Joanie and I were
                    married. We were married December 2nd, 1949. This is our fiftieth anniversary.
                    And I was there. And this wouldn't be a bad time to bring Howard Irwin and his
                    wife Doris into the picture. I think it would be an appropriate time to do
                    it.</p>
                <p>Howard Irwin was in partnership with Jim Lyons, Irwin Lyons Lumber Company in
                    North Bend, Oregon. He was a wealthy man. He had almost not made it, but the war
                    came along and helped all of those lumber companies. And then afterwards he did
                    very well, but he had a bad heart, and I often think that a person knows they're
                    going to die, they can make so much better judgments on how they leave things.
                    And he was just absolutely superb because he knew that he wasn't going to live
                    many years.</p>
                <p>I loved him. My booze problem was starting to percolate at that time, and I kind
                    of wish I could talk to him today. I think he'd be very pleased. (End of tape)Q:
                    ...Lyons died in Mexico?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, with Howard Irwin. On the yacht, I think on Howard'yacht. He had a
                    beautiful yacht.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>So that left Howard in charge of this company, and it wasn't just Irwin Lyons
                    Lumber Company; they had their own timber, they had their own ships, they had
                    their own yard in San Francisco. So they weren't - you know, it wasn't any small
                    outfit. It was a pretty self-contained outfit.</p>
                <p>And so anyway, I could just see that it was tough on him, on HowarIrwin. Then he
                    died.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not long after that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Not too long after that.</p>
                <p>At that time I had a brother-in-law, a man I admire in business, anyway, Eric
                    Hoffman of Hoffman Construction Company and all of that. He and Jean were
                    married; Jean is Joan's twin sister, identical twin sister. But he couldn't
                    leave anything as vast as Hoffman to go take care of this thing.</p>
                <p>So I decided I'd go down there, to North Bend. I said, “I'll give ia whirl for a
                    while; just hold the place for me at Dooly &amp; Company.”</p>
                <p>So I went down there. I often like to tell the story that they took a look at the
                    talent coming into the company, and they decided to liquidate. I think that's
                    funny. You only tell stories like that if you have confidence in yourself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got down there, they decided to liquidate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, after a while, yes. And I agreed with them, as far as that goes. And
                    so the liquidation took place, it was a very smart liquidation. We sold the
                    timber - we should have cruised it before we sold it; there was a lot more
                    timber there than we thought, but we sold that to the Menashe lumber company.
                    And then the mill site itself was sold to Al Pearce Lumber Company. The ships
                    were sold to - oh, various people; I've kind of forgotten who. I think Harold
                    Miller bought a ship. And then the lumber company in San Francisco was bought by
                    Jimmy Lyons' son, Stewart Lyons.</p>
                <p>So it all worked out very well because Doris Irwin got a lot of cash, and then
                    Joan and Jean, of course, did well. And then we had some children at that time,
                    and they got some of it, and the Hoffman kids got some of it. And that was just
                    the start of the bull market, so Joanie, you know, has done very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who made the decision to liquidate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, I think it was made by the two widows, and a man by the name of John
                    Hawkins, who was managing Irwin Lyons. He was fine and doing an excellent job,
                    but he really needed Howard Irwin and Jimmy Lyons to back him up on what he did.
                    I think he felt very alone without them, and I can understand why, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a complete timber operation, then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. With shipping. They shipped their own product. I mean, they weren't
                    big ships; they were LSNs, converted land ships and things like that.</p>
                <p>Matter of fact, Howard let Eric and I buy into one of the ships for a pretty
                    reasonable figure. And that gave me a lot of leeway that I hadn't had in the
                    past, so that when I did come back to Portland I was getting a certain income
                    from the ship for about three or four years, and then of course we sold the
                    ship. But I decided, “Well, the way to make money in this world is capital
                    gains, and not salary.” So that's when Western Batteries and George Sheahan
                    comes into the picture. He owned Western Batteries, and he owned a lot of other
                    things, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went down to North Bend, you really were
                        expecting ttake over the business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I thought probably, and that certainly was the perception that they
                    had. I mean, it made sense, you know. But I didn't know anything about it. I
                    mean, I really didn't, and it wasn't selling. It wasn't my - you know, they were
                    right. And they had wonderful people there to manage it.</p>
                <p>I think a son-in-law working for a wife is a tough job - because no matter who
                    you are, you still married the boss' daughter, no matter what kind of a job you
                    do, and I think it's awful tough. I've seen a lot of guys around this town and a
                    lot of guys around the world that - and they've done wonderful jobs, but they
                    aren't getting the credit they should.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving in and the reception there, what was that
                        like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, they were good. They were nice to me. I mean, after all, I was
                    Joan's husband, you know. And I'd come from Portland, and that was a big town
                    and all that.</p>
                <p>But I remember a couple, three weekends at the start Joanie and I just looking at
                    each other, and she'd cry a little bit, you know. It was tough. Then finally one
                    guy did come over and see us, and that kind of broke the ice, and everybody had
                    a party.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>Q: It sounds difficult.</p>
                <p>GREEN: It was difficult - because you were going from the height of it here, and
                    Joanie and I were, and I hope still are, a popular couple. It's small town, big
                    town stuff. You know that feeling. But now we've got people down there in Coos
                    Bay - well, I don't know if they're still there, but for a long time we had very
                    good friends down there. We made some dear friends that were terrific to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So people wouldn't talk to you at first?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Right at the start. I started out just where the lumber was coming out to
                    grade the lumber and watch how that was done and things like that. And then I'd
                    go in and have lunch with these guys at their breaks. They were fine for a
                    couple, three days, and then they just shut up on me. And I figured out, “Well,
                    okay, they found out I'm Howard Irwin's son-in-law,” you know. I really can't
                    blame them. I wasn't trying to learn something to help management; I was just
                    trying to learn something about the business.</p>
                <p>But I was glad to come back. I thought I did a pretty good job with the thing.
                    The main thing is that as far as I was concerned that after the leadership of
                    those two men that the family was going to get something out of this terrific
                    enterprise that these men had built, and it wasn't going to be wasted. It also
                    was how I got thinking about if I ever made money, I mean real money, how I
                    would distribute it among my family and grandchildren and things like that.
                    Howard Irwin taught me that, and I've been able to do that.</p>
                <p>I mentioned figures to you once, I think, right at the start. don't want those in
                    here. I don't think we should mention those.</p>
                <p>However, I should say that once Joan received her monies from the sale of the
                    mill and its properties, I immediately went to Harvey Black, my next door
                    neighbor, who was on the Board of the Bank of California at the time. We
                    established a trust at the Bank of California which I could not touch. I did not
                    want the possibility of the nightmare of losing any of my wife's money which I
                    had not earned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have you ever thought if you had picked it up down there
                        how yowould have gone about establishing yourself politically?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>GREEN: No, not really. I suppose I could have become a spokesman for the timber
                    industry type of thing and that sort of thing like John Hampton and Bill
                    Swindells who are the best. I think it would have taken a few years because you
                    have to get the confidence of the people. There were a lot of people down there
                    that had been there all their lives about my age - because I had a few years
                    under my belt in business here, but they were much more capable and much more
                    knowledgeable at that sort of thing than I was. It wasn't selling lumber. It was
                    the quality of the lumber, and the price was established. It wasn't the same
                    ball game as I was used to. So it was much better that we came back.</p>
                <p>And the house you're going to see next Tuesday is where we moved twhen we came
                    back. We've been there that long.</p>
                <p>Q: Tell me about the wedding and the aftermath, and I'd like to try to gain an
                    understanding of Joan through your learning more about her in the early
                    times.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I've known Joan all my life - no, since high school, both of them. I
                    took Jean out, as a matter of a fact, a couple of times before I took Joan out -
                    and this has been pointed out to me by Jean and Joan numerous times in the last
                    50 years.</p>
                <p>I think I told you about when I had a date broken, and I was in San Francisco at
                    Union Square or something, and I think that's about the first time Joanie and I
                    had - we'd known each other, but I saw her, and I just hailed her, and we went
                    over and had a drink at the Patent Leather Room in the St. Francis Hotel, and I
                    - you know, she was laughing at all my jokes and things like that. So that's a
                    good way to get to my heart, always has been.</p>
                <p>And then we started just seeing each other. I'd call her up when I was at
                    Stanford, and something would come along where I had to have a date, and then
                    I'd call Joan and see if she was free. And then she'd drive down. She had a car.
                    I had my Model A, but she'd drive down and stay with a friend or something down
                    there, or drive back; it wasn't that far. And we'd have our date, and then it
                    just started to progress.</p>
                <p>As I said, once I was in San Francisco to take the commuter train back to
                    Stanford, and the train was late, and I said to Joan, I said, “You wouldn't want
                    to get married, would you?” And boom! And I've often said to her, “I don't think
                    I ever really proposed to you. It was a question. We could discuss it.” But
                    anyway, it's the smartest thing I ever did. Actually, I tried to break it a
                    couple of times because I was scared stiff.</p>
                <p>And she broke it once, I think on the drinking. And I just didn'think that it
                    would work out.</p>
                <p>But one of the highest compliments I ever received was from Howard Irwin. We were
                    on his boat, and I said to him, “Mr. Irwin, there's something I'd like to
                    discuss with you.”</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>He said, “I know what it is, Punch. Doris and I are both delighted.”</p>
                <p>Well, I tried to handle my sons-in-law that way. You know, not grilthem. I wanted
                    to know about them a little bit, but that's all.</p>
                <p>So anyway, if I'm successful - and success can be defined lots of ways; I'm not
                    going to get too philosophical about this, but success isn't just being rich, I
                    can tell you. There's a lot of other things involved. I think a good teacher is
                    a very successful person. A good doctor is a very successful person. You've got
                    to be good at what you're doing; that's the main thing.</p>
                <p>But Joan's always been there for me. After I was arrested for driving while under
                    the influence on July the 3rd, 1962, the first telephone call I made was to my
                    wife at the beach. It was the next day, when I got out of jail and went to
                    Raleigh Hills Hospital. And she was crying, of course, and I just told her I was
                    awful sorry, but I was going to lick this thing. And she stayed right with me.
                    If she hadn't, of course, I wouldn't have been able to lick it.</p>
                <p>I've got another story to tell you. For example, when I went to Washington -
                    after the businesses progressed. They almost went broke, but then they
                    progressed, and there's nothing more triumphant than that. But Joanie didn't
                    want to leave Portland to go to live in Washington, DC. After we'd been there
                    for a while, she didn't want to come back. She was very happy to live there. And
                    I said, “No, I'm going back. I've got nothing more to do at this agency.” I
                    mean, we'd done what we wanted to do. We got the Shipping Act of 1985
                    through.</p>
                <p>And then Romania, she was absolutely - I mean, she was just fantastic as the wife
                    of the ambassador. You know, it's a small country in deep trouble and things
                    like that, and we were there when history was being made, and Joanie was just
                    superb. I mean, I know of a person she saved, whose life she saved, the upstairs
                    maid. That sounds pretty fancy, but ambassadors have those things. And the maid
                    had a growth in her neck, and Joanie got her into the only good hospital
                    there.</p>
                <p>When we went back a few years ago with the Stanford group - I've forgotten her
                    name, but the maid was still there. And they embraced; it was nice to see.</p>
                <p>We had a little difficulty for a while when I retired. I know I'm jumping ahead,
                    but we're talking about Joan now and the relationship, and I think it does
                    apply. I knew that I was going from extreme activity to just being a rich guy -
                    or financially independent, that's the word I like - financially independent guy
                    without any worries or anything, and you know - but I said, “I can handle
                    that.”</p>
                <p>Well, it was difficult. It was difficult to handle. I didn't worry about getting
                    back on booze or cigarettes or anything. It just was difficult, that's all.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>Then I had this prostate operation in 1993, and that kind of woke me up a little
                    bit, made me humble - or made me realize how lucky I was. So we've done pretty
                    well since. Dr. Tom Petrie was my physician.</p>
                <p>She plays bridge all the time. I don't play bridge at all. Play some golf
                    together. I'm a lousy golfer, though I'm getting better. I was out the other day
                    and did rather well.</p>
                <p>I like books, things like that. She's into flowers and things. So she's got a
                    very full life, and she asked me once, she said, “Do you mind if I -” like last
                    night for example, she asked me, she said, “Would you mind if I went down to the
                    beach next Tuesday? There's a bridge tournament I'd like to go to.” And I said,
                    “No, do it.” I'm going to bring the grandchildren down on Friday.</p>
                <p>But she's got a very full life, and that makes me feel very good.And my life now
                    is full.</p>
                <p>But I will tell you something, Jim, one of the smartest moves I've ever made in
                    retirement is the fact I got this office. I've got a place to go. I've got a
                    reason to put clothes on, I've got a reason to shave in the morning. And I fool
                    around down here doing little things, trying to help people and things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There are many people downtown doing the same thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I think so. I think so. I think if you can afford to do it - it's
                    expensive to do, but if you can afford it, boy, it's worth it. And they're
                    wonderful here. I just love them. I think I've been here longer than anybody. I
                    was here before Romania, but I gave it up, and then I was lucky enough to get
                    the same office back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you first got married, what were the routines, if you
                        carecall them, that you fell into or that developed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, we partied a lot. Joanie would get mad at me for trying to sell
                    insurance at a party. Well, I couldn't help it. It was just always paramount in
                    my mind. I would think of nothing else.</p>
                <p>That's one thing I've found is a strength and I guess a weakness in myself. I get
                    where I can't think of anything else. Like George Bush in '88, I couldn't think
                    of anything else but Oregon going for George Bush. We didn't, we lost by two
                    percent. But I mean, I get centralized on something. The battery company I got
                    centralized on making a profit. It's just - I don't know, it's just the way I
                    am.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>But we had a little house on Ravensview Drive. My dad was still alive, and they
                    had a little timber left with the Malarkeys, and we sold it. And Dad and Mom for
                    the first time in my life that I can recall had some money, some pretty major
                    money for that time. Dad bought a car from Gordon Grout's dad, Alva Grout, a
                    Chevrolet. That was a big moment in my parents' lives.</p>
                <p>And Dad put the down payment on the house - or I think he bought the house on
                    Ravensview Drive where Joanie and I first lived. So that made me very proud that
                    my family could contribute that much to this marriage. And then of course Dad
                    got sick, and that was before Medicare and all that stuff, but we had enough
                    money to handle Dad as best we could. And that was good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His illness was -?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Cancer. He smoked, and it started in the tongue anprogressed.</p>
                <p>I worked very hard. Howard Irwin saw to it that I got his insurance on Irwin
                    Lyons Lumber Company, which was a big account. They didn't think I could handle
                    it by myself, and I could - I went for advice, but there was one man, I forget
                    who it was, but he was pretty mad at me for not sharing it with him because he
                    knew everything, you know. I said, “I think I can handle this.” So I went to
                    fellows like Ferry Smith and Jim Bayless who were there at the time, and I got
                    very good coverage at very good rates for him. Because I said, “Well, that's one
                    thing I can pay them back for is get him a decent deal.”</p>
                <p>They had a marine accident, one of the ships, and we got it fixed, Lloyds, but we
                    got her fixed. Boy, I'll never forget that. And here it was the son-in-law,
                    and...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then comes the big claim.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, after about a year or so they'd had the accident. So they were
                    getting some confidence in me, but -. We got that thing settled and back going,
                    I think, in six months, which was fantastic.</p>
                <p>Howard Irwin didn't think it was fantastic. He thought it shoulhave been done the
                    week before, but it was really a fantastic job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the claims adjusters were...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: They were okay. Well, it was selling. That was me, selling. You know,
                    you've got to sell that, too. I just dropped everything. I said, “We've got to
                    get this claim settled or my marriage is ruined.” And we got it settled.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You then moved to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Then we moved to North Bend, and then we moved back tHawthorne Terrace,
                    where we are now. Pretty simple.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were at that point able to buy this house?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. Joanie bought it. She had the money to buy it. She bought it, and I
                    put her name on a lot of stuff that I had, and it turned out very well for both
                    of us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were your circle of friends at this time, and what did
                        you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Pretty much a lot of people that are friends now, except the ones that
                    have died. I kind of anticipated you might ask that question, and I was trying
                    to think of who the old - I know I've mentioned some of the old friends.</p>
                <p>Doug McIver is an old friend. Jim Robbins, there's a guy that I've known since
                    youth that should be included, I think one of the funniest and smartest men
                    alive today. I just look at Jim Robbins and I laugh. He's a wonderful man.</p>
                <p>Then later on there's fellows like John Hampton, Mort Bishop, Jim Holland, Dean
                    Johnson, Pete Walsh, Graham Barbey, Fred Fields, Bruce Ward, Ernie Swigert, Dan
                    Bell, etc.</p>
                <p>I'm sure I am making a mistake by listing any names because I am positive I'm
                    missing a lot of people (i.e., Cal Knudson, Ned Look, et. al), but as this
                    effort in oral history form, I am using the names which are involved with the
                    events as I remember them.</p>
                <p>Let me tell you this; I was thinking about this. I don't think my life is
                    probably any different if you change things, but what happens to me, I become
                    very close to the people I've worked with, and we haven't gotten into that yet,
                    but then once I've sold, and all of those people, they've all got pieces of the
                    action, so I feel that they've done well and I've done well, okay? Including
                    women doing well with pieces of the action, i.e. Dee Bedgood at Benson
                    Industries, owned some Benson stock.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>But then you move on to something else. Not that you forget these people; you
                    don't forget them. But they - you're with other people now, and you need them,
                    and they need you, and you kind of just adjust and your acquaintanceship becomes
                    just vast, and your friendships are vast. I've got them all over the world, and
                    I know that. But it isn't that I dislike the guy that I grew up with, or he's
                    moved away or something. I don't dislike him, I love him still, but I'm doing
                    what I'm doing at the time.</p>
                <p>I mean, I've got people now that have retired in Palm Springs that are extremely
                    good friends, and will probably be till the end of this little journey we're all
                    on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've been around a lot.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. And you get that way. You become extremely close to people in a given
                    situation, like in the revolution, you know, when we were in the embassy, and
                    then you don't see them again. You get a Christmas card back and forth, every
                    once in a while you might run across each other. In Washington I ran across a
                    fellow who was a lawyer at the Federal Maritime Commission. We had a lot of fun
                    talking.</p>
                <p>That's what people don't realize - or I don't think they think much about it, is
                    the fact that as your life changes your acquaintanceship changes. And there are
                    nice people everywhere. There are not-nice people everywhere, too. But that's
                    your job, to figure that one out.</p>
                <p>I'm a great believer in water reaching its own level, and I don't mean that in
                    any snobbish way. I mean that talented people - I think you and I just got
                    acquainted, but I think when we get through with this thing, I think we're going
                    to be pretty good friends. (End of tape)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...did you talk about having children?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, we didn't talk about children. I mean, we wanted children. We had two
                    daughters, and I just think they're world-class daughters.</p>
                <p>And then we were in, North Bend, and I think I know the instant it happened
                    because I was very careful; I didn't want another child. But anyway, it
                    happened. And we came back up here, and that's how we know how long we've lived
                    in this house because Joanie was pregnant with Laddie when we moved in. Laddie
                    is the one that lives in Winnetka. She's about 42-43 now.</p>
                <p>John Bubalo, who is a doctor around town - he's still alive, and I still see him
                    occasionally at Waverley Country Club, a wonderful man - he came in, I was in
                    the waiting room having a cigarette, of course, you know, in Good Samaritan
                    Hospital, 11:30 a.m., wasn't anything traumatic at all. And he said, “Punch, I'm
                    sorry.”</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>And then I really got worried. We didn't have to go in and watch the child being
                    born, and we didn't know what gender it was. And I think that's half the fun of
                    it, too, I might add. And so anyway, all of a sudden I thought something was the
                    matter with Joan or something was the matter with the child.</p>
                <p>I said, “What do you mean, you're sorry?”</p>
                <p>He said, “It's another girl.”I said, “That's what I wanted.” And she's turned out
                    to be a marvelous person.</p>
                <p>I'm not an outdoorsman, and I never have been. I'm a klutz. I like being indoors.
                    I don't like hiking, I don't like bicycling, I don't like any of this stuff. I
                    mean, I just don't like it. I'm no good at it. It bores me. I go on a fishing
                    trip every once in a while just to be with the whole family, but I'm really no
                    good at it. I'm not going to do it anymore. I'll pay for it, but just don't take
                    me on it, that's all.</p>
                <p>So girls, you know, you don't have to be an outdoorsman with a girl. With a boy,
                    I'd have to show him something. I can't ski, I can't do any of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were pleased to have a girl.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I wanted girls. I wanted good looking girls. That's all I asked God, don't
                    give me not attractive girls. And there's pictures of them over here. I think
                    they're awfully good looking girls. Of course, I'm the proud father.</p>
                <p>I like to say Carter was born November 29th and we were marrieDecember 2nd -
                    which is true, only it was the next year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So as the children were growing up, how did you raise
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I'm glad you asked that, because there was a person that was involved with
                    the children - you've got to realize I had a drinking problem. It wasn't
                    destructive or anything. Carter said an interesting thing this winter in Palm
                    Springs. She said, “Oh, Dad, we don't even remember it. We were too young.”</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>There was a Mrs. Johnson, Mrs. Bertha T. Johnson, an African-American. But she
                    loved those kids. God, she loved them. She taught them the prayers. She taught
                    them everything, and they loved her. And Kelsey still goes out to her grave. And
                    I think Mrs. Johnson had as much to do with the success of these kids as Joan
                    and I. I really do. She was just wonderful. I do want her mentioned in this
                    thing.</p>
                <p>She didn't like men. I think she was treated very badly by men. She finally liked
                    me after I finally proved that I had stopped drinking. She finally did.</p>
                <p>I'll tell you a story about Mrs. Johnson. I had a next-door neighbor, Harvey
                    Black, who I adored. He was an attorney, and a fine attorney and had a lot to do
                    with the Swigert interest and all of that in this town.</p>
                <p>Well, Mrs. Johnson had some property in the Lloyd's Center area that she'd been
                    paying on for years, a home. And that property was just getting hotter than a
                    pistol, and she'd paid it off. And she couldn't get the title. And I said to
                    her, “What you need is a good attorney, Mrs. Johnson, one you can trust.”</p>
                <p>So I didn't think a thing of it. The phone rang the next night, and it's Harvey
                    Black, and he wanted to talk to Mrs. Johnson. I said, “Oh, my god.” You know, I
                    could see myself coming up with tens of thousands of dollars in fees, you know,
                    to get the damn property. But I was going to do it if I had to.</p>
                <p>But anyway, Mrs. Johnson talked to Harvey Black. And then after they got through
                    talking, I asked her, I said, “Mrs. Johnson, did you talk to Mr. Black?” She
                    said, “Yes, I talked to Mr. Black. He's the only attorney I know that I can
                    trust.”</p>
                <p>So anyway, by God, Harvey put the whole bunch at it. He said, “We're getting that
                    property for that woman.” And he did; she got her property.</p>
                <p>So I'm out at Waverley Country Club at a dance, and Harvey's there with his
                    wonderful wife, Beverly, who's still alive and still lives right next door to
                    us. And anyway, Harvey comes up to me and he says, “Punch, I want to talk to
                    you. Now, I don't do these things for free, you know, on Mrs. Johnson.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, I realize that, Harvey.” Harvey said, “I want to know something:
                    Do you think $10 is too much?” I said, “Ten dollars is fine.” So he sent her a
                    bill for $10, and I said to her, “Mrs. Johnson, did you pay Mr. Black?” And she
                    said, “Yes, I did.” She didn't think anything of it. She thought $10 was
                    adequate, too.</p>
                <p>That's what you run across in this life. And Harvey Black had tough reputation of
                    being a tough guy. He wasn't; he was wonderful.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>When we moved into the house, the space between the two homes - I'll show it to
                    you - was just gravel and mud. You know, Harvey could afford anything he wanted,
                    but Mr. Burke we bought it from - he was in the wheat business - he didn't want
                    to pay his half. Well, Harvey wasn't about to pay it himself, so for years they
                    had that muddy mutual driveway.</p>
                <p>Harvey called me up as soon as we moved in, and he says, “Would you like to pave
                    the driveway?” I said, “Sure, I'll go half with you. Why don't we do it right
                    now?” And boy, we were friends immediately. That's the way he was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it show that Mrs. Johnson didn't like men?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I think she had had a couple or three husbands that hatreated her
                    badly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did she say things that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Not much, no. But Mrs. Johnson, when the kids would have a beau - they get
                    to that stage, of course, 16, 17 years of age - and the guy would bring them to
                    the front door - I didn't know this, but as soon as they would get to the front
                    door, the door would open and Mrs. Johnson was there. The guy had no chance to -
                    he'd better stay in the car if he wanted to try anything.</p>
                <p>They called her Johnnie; we all called her Johnnie. She was justerrific. I've got
                    a picture of her somewhere at home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any experience with blacks...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No. No, not really. In government I met quite a few. I'having an
                    experience now with a black.</p>
                <p>I happen to like them. I think it's awful tough to be black. I mean, how you are
                    born. It's a roll of the dice. And I just think it's tougher than hell to be
                    black. But boy, when you get a good one, oh, boy. Particularly in government I
                    had a chance to move them up if they were good, and I've moved them up! And
                    they, of course, became very faithful to me, but I said, “No, you earned it
                    yourself.” But I knew how they felt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about as a kid in Portland?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>GREEN: In Portland we didn't have many at Lincoln. Jefferson mainly had the
                    blacks. There were a few, but not many. We had a lot of Poles, Greeks, Italians,
                    and everything else there. They called it Slabtown at Lincoln. Then we had the
                    Snob Hill boys, that's me, up there in Portland Heights. But we had a good
                    mixture. We didn't have any of this tragedy that's going on now.</p>
                <p>Q: At a certain point - going back to your work life again - things began to
                    change. You separated from Dooly &amp; Company. How did that change take place?
                    Did you get interested in other opportunities?</p>
                <p>GREEN: No. I had gone down to Irwin Lyons. Then they liquidated it. Then I saw,
                    well, this is how you make money, capital gains. Salary isn't the answer.
                    Capital gains.</p>
                <p>Before I go on, let me mention the following: Peter Walsh called me one day and
                    asked me to join this group which was bringing Professional Golf to Portland,
                    Oregon, and at the time it was a pretty big deal. There were 20 of us. The
                    newspapers called us “The Trembling Twenty.” All the sponsors were very good
                    golfers with the exception of me, but Peter wanted me to sell tickets and that's
                    what I did for him. But the reason I bring it up is because these twenty men
                    that formed this group, we kind of bonded together, and I just don't have all
                    the names and some have passed on like Bob Gunderson and Charlie Davis, but I
                    just have a great feeling about this group. We never had to dip into our own
                    pockets, and we donated quite a bit to charity, and we also had an awful lot of
                    fun. The group tended to open doors for me socially that had never been
                    available before because I'm not much of an athlete. Bob Atkinson can confirm my
                    athletic ability. However, he would tell you I am a scratch crap shooter.</p>
                <p>So I came back, and I put a little money into - with Joanie's help, guarantees
                    and things - I put a little money into this thing called Western Batteries,
                    which George Sheahan owned. It was losing money hand over fist, and I bought it
                    for half the amount of the inventory, so I couldn't really get hurt in the deal.
                    Just the effort.</p>
                <p>And there was a man there. His name is Bill Kennedy, and he should be included in
                    this thing, and I'll show you his picture next week. That's what gave me the
                    idea about having you up at the house. And Bill and I worked together on this
                    thing, and we had two guys out in the shop. And then it got a little better and
                    better, and then we finally made money in February.</p>
                <p>And I'll tell you another great help to us at that time was Moe Tonkon, an
                    attorney. He was the first person I saw when I wanted a Jewish member of the
                    University Club, Moe Tonkon. He did it. That was 1965.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>But anyway, we built a new factory, 15,000 square feet. We didn't figure out how
                    we'd ever fill it up with stuff at first, but then we knew that we had to expand
                    it and all that - and the reason was very simple, that it was that golf cart
                    batteries were just starting, and the big boys didn't want to change their
                    production. - I think I've covered this a little bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was before we recorded. This is now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, okay. And so anyway, we were shipping tens of thousands of these, to
                    Hawaii and everywhere. And they were good batteries, awfully good. I told the
                    people, I said, “I'm not going to argue with you about price.” I said, “I'm
                    going to make a little money on each battery, but I'll promise you there's going
                    to be as much lead as it will hold” - and that's what makes the life of the
                    battery - “and it will be as deep a chamber or cell as we can provide.” And we
                    even had Evans Production in Corvallis making special separators for us and
                    things like that. We got to be pretty big time.</p>
                <p>And then Chloride of London, England came along and wanted to know if we wanted
                    to sell, and we sold it. I think I made a mistake in calling them once too
                    often. I think I could have gotten a little better price. But we got an awfully
                    good price.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you go into it in the beginning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, I was just thinking about building it up and capitagaining it, that's
                    all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why that particular...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Because I got a deal on something where I understood what the product was,
                    and it was a sell situation, and I couldn't lose because I got it for half the
                    inventory, but all it took, really, was my effort - and I had Bill Kennedy, the
                    guy who really knew about a battery. I had the combination I needed. I mean, we
                    had obsolete equipment and everything else, but that was all right. We were able
                    to remedy that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you bought it at half of the value of the
                        inventory?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Of the inventory, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you couldn't lose.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>GREEN: Well, theoretically. I could lose a lot of time. I sold Western Batteries
                    in 1977 and Bill Kennedy got a well-earned 30% and Red Denning - our accountant
                    - 5%.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you bought it, your idea was to see what could be
                        done witit...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: And sell it. Build it up, yes. Burns Bros. was our first big customer. And
                    then, of course, we come into Bill Swinford, and we should mention him. This is
                    a good time to mention Bill Swinford. But anyway, Bill Swinford and I became
                    acquainted through, I think, Burns Bros. Bill Swinford is from Roseburg. I think
                    he lives in Arizona now. And here's a guy that, you know, I haven't seen in
                    years. So again, I think he and I are very close friends. But he retired.</p>
                <p>I don't think Bill - oh, I suppose maybe a couple of years of high school, that's
                    about all, but one of the best businessmen I've ever known in my life. And
                    honest, too.</p>
                <p>I ended up doing a consignment deal with him, and it was Southern Oregon Battery
                    Supply, and I had to get him - and he got Air Reduction (Airco), which is
                    welding supply equipment and things like that, and he needed a bank loan,
                    $10,000. And I guaranteed the bank loan for $10,000. For that Bill gave me 30
                    percent of the business.</p>
                <p>And we had another fellow names Gene Keatsman in there, where he got a little of
                    the business, too, and I gave up five percent and Bill gave up five percent.</p>
                <p>And then he had Western Explosives, which was hauling Trojan powder going from
                    one magazine to another. You couldn't lose on Trojan. All they did was pay us to
                    haul it. I mean, it was fantastic. And Bill gave me 30 percent. I said, “You
                    don't have to give me any of this. I didn't do anything for this.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Where would I be without you?” That's the kind of guy hwas.</p>
                <p>We sold that business for quite a bit of money relative to investment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were really instrumental with getting that $10,000
                        loan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: That's right. And he was instrumental with me, too.</p>
                <p>And as a matter of fact, when we sold Southern Oregon Battery and Supply, which
                    is the name of the company, SOB, out of Roseburg - we were in Roseburg, Coos Bay
                    and Medford. When we sold that company to Stan Richardson, the consignment -
                    that's not quite true. I was on his board, and I know what he was doing. So I
                    said, “Bill, let's get off this consignment stuff. I mean, we're entitled to be
                    paid for our product; we don't have to wait anymore.”</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>But the important thing was that hundreds of thousands of batteries had passed
                    between the two - between the manufacturer and S.O.B. And nobody went down there
                    and counted every six months to see if it turned out okay. We were about 50
                    batteries apart. And I said to Bill Kennedy, “Give it to them.”</p>
                <p>It was just remarkable. Amazing. That's something that people don't know much
                    about this company because it's outside Portland and that sort of thing, but it
                    certainly had a lot to do with the success I've had. I mean, knowing guys like
                    that. Their language isn't the best and all that, and their jokes are pretty
                    base, but they're terrific people, good people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And when you bought Western Batteries, what sort of idea
                        did yohave about how this company could be developed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I didn't really have one. I just felt if I could get some accounts going
                    through it - as a matter of fact, when I started, I got rid of most of the
                    accounts we had because we were losing too much money on them. It was better not
                    to sell them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were they losing money on them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: They were just too cheap. They weren't paying their bill, or if they were
                    paying their bill, I mean, the battery might cost ten dollars to manufacture,
                    and they were buying it for eight, that sort of thing. Anything to get it out of
                    the door. You'd be surprised how many people make a mistake like that. I'll give
                    you a story later on when we're talking about Benson about that guy I hired from
                    W.P. Fuller Company.</p>
                <p>But anyway, so I really didn't have any grand plan. I just thought if I could
                    build it up and make it successful and make it where it's making money, somebody
                    will want to buy this thing, and I want to sell. And I was very honest with Bill
                    Kennedy about that. I said, “We don't have family; this thing isn't something I
                    inherited or you inherited or something like that. It's nothing like that; we're
                    building this thing up to sell it. What's the matter with that?”</p>
                <p>And he agreed. And I said, “But you're going to have a good piece of it.” And he
                    had 30 percent. So Bill was able to walk away with a nice lifetime check.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were bringing real management to it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>GREEN: I guess, so. Yes. I'll tell you a funny story. We got a used truck, and we
                    spent a lot of money on the used truck. We needed one. And we had it all
                    repainted, and God, it was just beautiful. We thought it was gorgeous. And the
                    damn thing had a short in it somewhere, and we could never find it. And there it
                    was, Western Batteries, and the thing was stopped all over town. [laughs] So
                    embarrassing.</p>
                <p>Finally I went to a pal and I said, “You've got to find what it is.”</p>
                <p>I remember the first load of batteries that Bill Swinford took out of the plant
                    on his way to Roseburg, and I'll tell you, that truck was tipping. I mean, it
                    was just all askew.</p>
                <p>I said, “Jesus, just don't go by any road where the weigh stations are. You're
                    going to get hauled off.” And I said, “Call me collect from Roseburg to let me
                    know you made it - because if you tip over, we're both out of business.” And he
                    called me collect. He made it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you introduced some real selling to this outfit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. That's what I did bring to it. I think that's what I brought to
                    it. I have a lot of acquaintance - “Why would you want a battery?” I found a lot
                    of places where you could use them and then of course the others started.</p>
                <p>The Burns Bros., Jack Burns and Bob Burns, they were the first big account we
                    had. Boy, I had to get them awful low, but there I did learn where you could go
                    low with a little more volume because by buying in volume I could buy my lead a
                    little cheaper, and so it was there.</p>
                <p>But it was a fascinating experience, with Southern Oregon Battery and Supply and
                    Western Explosives, and of course Western Batteries, it gave me a base that gave
                    me a lot of confidence, too, that I could take on about anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you sell Jack Burns? He was a big client.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I knew him. You know, I went over there and - one thing we'd do was
                    we'd put private labels on them. We had an Auto-Ful Battery. It was my idea
                    because there was Auto Lite Battery which was well-known - fill it three times a
                    year. That was a big thing at that time. So I said, “Well, we've got to protect
                    it some way or another.”</p>
                <p>I never will forget years later we were making a lot of inroads with the Auto-Ful
                    Battery, and the Auto Lite people wrote me a very nasty letter. And I took it
                    down and gave it to Moe Tonkon, and he said, “This is the greatest publicity you
                    could get. You've been going long enough. Don't worry about it. Do you want me
                    to reply?”</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>I said, “Well, you handle it the way you want.” So that was the enof it.</p>
                <p>Moe was a great friend of George Sheahan's, and that's kind of how we inherited
                    Moe. And God, I used him all the time, but he never sent me a bill. So finally I
                    got embarrassed when we started to make some real money, and so around Christmas
                    time I'd give a few bonuses out, and I'd always send Mo a couple of thousand
                    dollars or something.</p>
                <p>And he'd call me up and say, “What's this for?” And I said, “Well, it's for past
                    services. You're entitled to something.” And he said, “I feel like a kept
                    man.”He was wonderful.</p>
                <p>Q: George Sheahan, perhaps you could draw us a picture of him.</p>
                <p>GREEN: All right. Joanie and I were on our honeymoon, and we spent it in Palm
                    Springs. We were at a place I picked out, and she didn't like it at all. We were
                    there for such a short length of time that I got some money back on my deposit.
                    That's the kind of place it was. I thought it looked great from the
                    pamphlet.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we went down to Palm Springs and stayed at the Desert Inn. And we were
                    out one night at the Racquet Club, I think it was, down there, and George
                    Sheahan was in there. And we were talking and that sort of thing, and he was a
                    wonderful man. Very dapper. Very dapper man. And he said, “Well, let me know if
                    you ever want to do something outside the insurance business” - you know, at
                    that time I was with Dooly - “I've got this little battery company.”</p>
                <p>So I always remembered that, and I went to see him once, and that's how we struck
                    the deal. And then we had a lot of fun together. We got to know each other very
                    well.</p>
                <p>And I'll tell you one thing that was kind of nice, when George died - he died in
                    Las Vegas, I think shooting craps. He had an aneurism. But anyway, he had stock
                    in the company, of course; he had the other 50 percent. But we had a deal that
                    if anything happened to one of us the other would get it, and then that's how I
                    got some of it over to Bill Kennedy and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>And there was another guy, Red Denning, who was our accountant, and he had a
                    small piece of it. Mo Tonkon wouldn't take any of it. I offered it to him, but
                    he wouldn't take it. He just didn't do that, didn't believe in it.And George's
                    widow, when he died, he died at a certain time, and I forget when our fiscal was
                    over, but we could have paid George Sheahan's estate for the stock a certain
                    amount of money. But I said to Moe, “We're having an awfully good year. If we
                    wait a couple or three weeks and Red gives us the figure, won't that stock be
                    worth a little bit more?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Yes, it would be.”</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>I said, “Let's wait.” And it was worth a few thousand dollars more. So that's
                    what we paid the estate, and the estate had forgotten that they even owned it.
                    It wasn't a big deal with George Sheahan. BUT that gave me a kind of a thrill, I
                    think. Jennifer, his wife, said she'd take a very nice trip or something like
                    that with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm interested in hearing more about Moe Tonkon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: He was a remarkable man. He liked me. He had a tremendous practice, liked
                    to help young people. He just was one of a kind. I remember when I asked him
                    into the University Club, and he said “You don't need that.” I said, “Yes, we
                    do. I've got to have you. You, and I'm going after Gene Oppenheimer, who's on
                    the Supreme Court.” Oppenheimer I couldn't get because he was too old and
                    wouldn't go through the hassle. But Moe came along, and then he went along to
                    the Arlington Club. He was the token Jew for a while. But then they joined
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember the details of that change in the
                        University Club?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, nobody thought much about it. I remember when they asked me to be
                    the membership chairman, and it was a high compliment because I'd just been
                    sober for a couple of years, and people were starting to think, “Well, maybe he
                    means it now, and we can bring him back into responsibilities.” And they asked
                    me to be membership chairman at the University Club. I was president in 1967, so
                    this is probably '65.And I said, “Well, I'll do it, but only if you allow people
                    of the Jewish faith, and perhaps -” and at that time we called them blacks, not
                    African-Americans. I said, “Look, it says just two years of college.” So I said,
                    “Let's knock this nonsense off.” I said, “Otherwise, don't ask me.”</p>
                <p>So to make a long story short, they did ask me, and I promised them that I would
                    get the best and let it go from there. And we did. I started with Moe, and then
                    we had some others. And if you go up to the University Club now, you see
                    marvelous Jewish men and women, and you see them over at the Arlington Club. I
                    think I had a lot to do with starting this in Portland. I've always been
                    secretly very proud of that.</p>
                <p>And then we got - and we had a dentist - gosh, I can't think of his name - black.
                    He was a Republican, and we used to work together a little bit. And he joined
                    the University Club, and I tried to get another. And I remember sitting with him
                    at an annual meeting - and you know, it's always tough to be black; you stand
                    out. He just called me up a couple of weeks after, as I recall, and said,
                    “Punch, I can't get that much out of it, and they're not ready to accept me
                    yet.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Well, maybe you're right.” But we tried.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And when the Jews came in, was there any fallout?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No. Not the ones that we brought in, hell, no. They had a lot of power in
                    this town. Let me tell you something, they were very careful about who they let
                    in. That's what I was counting on. And I told Mo, I said, “We've got to be
                    careful on this thing. Don't let it backfire on us. We don't want” - I don't
                    want to use a word, if you don't mind, on the recording - but “we don't want
                    bad, anymore than we want bad Irishmen or bad Englishmen or bad anything else.
                    We don't want that.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, cheap. Bad business reputations. Not being able to speak the English
                    language. A lot of little things, it being a gentlemen's club. Now, ladies are
                    joining the Arlington Club. I'm sponsoring a lady, as a matter of fact, right
                    now.</p>

                <p>GREEN: No, I don't. I recall Gus Solomon, but I don't recall asking him, no. I
                    didn't feel that close to him. He was a judge. But Solomon never joined?</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think he didn't. I think he resisted it. So
                        WesterBatteries, and then this kind of flowed on into...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, what happened was a fellow named Chet Patton came over to see me
                    once at Western Batteries. He said, “This is going along pretty well. How would
                    you like to join me in a glass company that I think we can really do something
                    with?” Tom Benson Glass Company was out at that time right in the middle of the
                    black section of town, Williams Avenue. And I looked at it, and I had my usual
                    optimism and everything else.</p>
                <p>And I borrowed the money from the bank, and Joanie guaranteed it. I didn't have
                    enough assets, but Joanie did, plenty, so I paid the interest for years.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>But we went through a tough time. A man named Jerry Clancy was the manager, and
                    he knew a lot more about glass than we did, but I think he resented us. And we
                    had an awful time with Hoffman Construction Company. There was a
                    misunderstanding on a bond which we had purchased with Hoffman. And I would have
                    frankly dropped it, but Jerry Clancy and Chet Patton wouldn't let me do it, and
                    I did not have 51% of the firm.</p>
                <p>So anyway, it went into a pretty bad situation. The relationshibeen repaired
                    now.</p>
                <p>But you know, it got pretty bad from the booze and all that, and I bought Chet
                    out. And then I was having an awful time with the glass company. The battery
                    company was doing fine, and Southern Oregon was fine. Everything was fine but
                    this.</p>
                <p>And I had a $40,000 loan at the First National Bank, at the Industrial Branch,
                    and a man by the name of George Goforth, and he was just kind - he'd always be
                    there for me when I had to postpone that, and I postponed I don't know how many
                    times. I got scared, I guess.</p>
                <p>So anyway, I got arrested for driving under the influence (my lawyer Bill
                    Bernard's term - it was drunken driving) on July 3rd, 1962, and after spending a
                    night in jail I went to Raleigh Hills Hospital. And after calling Joan, then
                    that Monday I called George Goforth up because I had a meeting with him on
                    Tuesday. And I said to him, “George, I can't make the meeting on Tuesday.” And
                    extremely coldly said, “Why can't you?”</p>
                <p>I said - and you've got to realize alcoholism at that time was not acommon as it
                    is now - I mean, it wasn't recognized as such.</p>
                <p>But anyway, he said, “Why not?” And I said, “Because I'm in Raleigh Hills
                    Hospital taking treatment for alcoholism.” And there was dead silence on the
                    other end of the line.</p>
                <p>Now, mind you, Joanie had said she loved me and she would stay with me if I
                    didn't take a drink. That was the one thing. The other thing, I had a business
                    going down the tube, and I needed time to get it going again.</p>
                <p>And finally I said, “George, are you there?” He said, “Yes.” And said, “What do
                    you want to say?”</p>
                <p>And he said, “You don't have to come in.” And my heart just sank, and I said,
                    “What do you mean, I don't have to come in?” And he said, “Your loan is
                    renewed.”</p>
                <p>And I'll tell you, I've never heard words that lifted something so quickly. We
                    became a terrific account of the bank. I'm still at Wells Fargo because of
                    George Goforth and what he did that day. I've never gotten over it.</p>

                <p>John Elorriaga was mad at me because I didn't go over there because he loaned the
                    $10,000 on the Southern Oregon Battery, and I said, “John, let me tell you a
                    story.” And I told him this story, and he said, “You're right.” And John
                    Elorriaga doesn't give up very easily, but he agreed with me on that.</p>
                <p>I mean, these amounts don't seem like much now, $10,000 and $40,000,but they were
                    huge when we were doing it in the '60s.</p>
                <p>But I think that moment had as much to do with my approaching the sobriety and
                    staying with it and everything as any moment, that and Joan. I can't tell you
                    what it meant to me.</p>
                <p>Q: Isn't it amazing that he had the latitude to make a decision like that. Do you
                    think that was something that would have applied then but would be less likely
                    to apply now?</p>
                <p>GREEN: That's an interesting question. I don't know. I would imagine a $40,000
                    loan wouldn't be much now, and probably a clerk could make that decision. But at
                    that time - he was very well thought of in the bank and should have been.</p>
                <p>We had to get the glass company out of there. They were putting the freeway
                    through, and we moved it over to Raleigh Street, and Ed Wolcott was manager
                    then, and he died of cancer. And Ed was good.</p>
                <p>It was a very competitive business. We weren't paying any attention to it. We
                    didn't have the right people. You couldn't get PPG, Pittsburgh Plate Glass, the
                    Fuller Company had it, and we couldn't get Libbey Owens Ford, Morehouse had
                    that. We had American St. Gobain, which was French and didn't mean a damn thing.
                    It was mostly products, imported glass, and then we started taking on some other
                    things, windows and things like that. So we just finally got it rolling, and
                    Fuller went out - and let me tell you something, we had a salesman from Fuller,
                    and he came over. I was going to mention this to you when you were talking about
                    pricing and everything. And he was one of their top salesman. And so I was
                    paying - I don't know what we were paying.</p>
                <p>But anyway, he came over, and he sold a $10,000 shipment of glass, $10,000. Gave
                    them two percent, payable in 90 days. And that one came across my desk, so I
                    called him in, and I said, “Let's pencil this thing out. I'm paying you this
                    amount. We've got $10,000 we've got to borrow to pay Pittsburgh to get our 2%.”
                    Oh, yes, and he had a 10 percent markup on it. “So you're giving two percent on
                    10,000, that's $200. Now, the rest of it is what we have for profit, and we've
                    got to wait 90 days for the money. I've got to pay you. I've got to pay the
                    overhead, all that. And you know, it doesn't work. There's no profit.”</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>So he said, “Well, I don't think we can get along.” And I said, “No, we can't.”
                    But I said, “I'll honor this sale so it's not an embarrassment to you, but no,
                    not with this philosophy. You can't do it. And that's what killed your company
                    too.”</p>
                <p>But then we built that company up, and then I had Claris Poppert with me, and
                    he's done very well. He's retired. He sold out. It took them about 10 years to
                    buy me out, but they did. Now they've got a man down there named Lou Niles, who
                    is a totally superb man. And they're all over the world. That book there is
                    Benson. It shows some of their projects all over the world.</p>
                <p>But it was awful touch and go for a while, boy. Awful touch and go. I think my
                    sobriety turned it around, and I think the fact we got a guy named Ted Brown
                    from Mercer Steel - Mercer was our big competitor. And we got him to come over
                    with us, and he got a good piece of the action. And between Claris and Ted
                    Brown, Dee Bedgood, myself and others, we just started humming with it.</p>
                <p>And then I made a deal with Bill Macy, of Blaesing Granite Company, and that
                    won't mean a thing to you, but anyway, it's the outside of a building - because
                    they had other material besides granite; that was just in their title. And so
                    what we did is confuse the general contractors at that time because they wanted
                    us to break out our figures. We wouldn't do it, but our total figure was lower
                    than whatever the combined opposition was. And usually Macy would be the head of
                    it because his number was more - he had more dollars involved in his facing than
                    we had in our glass, but sometimes we'd take the lead. We just killed them
                    around this town.</p>
                <p>I'll never forget - money is always important in business, and being sure that
                    you can get paid in a reasonable length of time is very, very important. And so
                    there was a Christmas party going on, and I had heard the retention on a huge
                    job had been sent out. There was about $100,000 and some odd dollars for Benson
                    in there, and a couple hundred thousand for Blaesing. And so I called - Macy was
                    out of town, and I called the bookkeeper and asked if it had come out. “Oh,
                    yes,” and she'd had a few pops, and she said, “I think so.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Could you make me out a check?” “Sure. Can you come out and get it?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Yes, I will.” I came out and got it, took it to the bank. And in those
                    days, if you could get your balance down to nothing for three or four days, it
                    was terrific as far as the bank auditors were concerned. And that's exactly what
                    happened to me that Christmas; I was down to nothing. We didn't owe them a dime.
                    And I got this tremendous phone call - I knew I was going to get it on December
                    27th, I it was, from Macy.</p>
                <p>“Well,” I said, “Have you got it?”</p>
                <p>And he said, “Yes, it came in today's mail.”</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>And I said, “Well, what's the problem, then?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, you're not supposed to do that.”</p>
                <p>I said, “I needed it. Gave me a very merry Christmas.”</p>
                <p>But he is a great guy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I need help understanding...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, well, look at the building behind you. See the glass, and then see in
                    between? That's what we did, and so we'd give them one figure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So for the whole works?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. But if I broke it out, say the glass figure for that building would
                    be a million-and-a-half dollars, and the other side was three million, they
                    could maybe shop around and find a glass figure for a million two, but they
                    couldn't find the other. Combine the two, we were lower. One company would take
                    it, and then we were sub to that company. It was my idea. It worked smoothly.
                    God, I just loved it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did that more than once?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. We did that quite a few times. And then I left.There wasn't
                    anything more for me to do.</p>
                <p>I run myself out of jobs, I find, in business. I would run out of where I was
                    needed. I mean, after all I sold - how many businesses was I involved in
                    selling? About 6 - and I'm the only guy that nobody ever asked to stay. They
                    don't need me. That's the reason I went into public life because I just figured
                    - I mean, I was a financially independent man.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>In order for this oral history to have some credibility, it should include some
                    misjudgments on my part. I have a great error in judgment to my credit - Benson
                    Glass Company's accounting firm is Price-Waterhouse (I've been with them since
                    Lassie was a puppy). They had, in the late sixties, a young outside auditor who
                    took over our account. I liked him immediately, and he always had a book with
                    him which dealt with primary accounting - you can imagine how this tickled me
                    and my sense of humor. He came up with ideas to help me get over this rough spot
                    in Benson history. One day he approached me and wanted me to put $10,000 in a
                    new athletic company he was starting - his name, of course, is Phil Knight, and
                    the company is Nike. I didn't have $10,000 to gamble at this time - well! I've
                    been very lucky in life but this was a good lesson to me - I can never get
                    conceited.</p>
                <p>I, occasionally, see Phil Knight and success couldn't happen to nicer guy.</p>
                <p>***Q: This is a continuation of the oral history with Alan Green, “Punch” Green,
                    and the date today is the 4th of May, 1999.</p>
                <p>You were just talking about the differences between the two family lines and sort
                    of the spirit of the families, and you were saying that when times got tough,
                    then the characteristics of the two family lines would show up.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. I don't mean to in any way denigrate the Greens. I mean, obviously
                    they were terrific people; look at their history. But I don't know, it just
                    seems to me that we tended to give up at the crucial times. Whereas the Irwin
                    side of the family, and the wife I married - the booze, which we'll talk about
                    later, and things - but I mean when I would be just devastated with the business
                    situations that happen - as you're building a business, it's not all easy, and
                    there are a lot of times you just don't think you'll pull it off - and Joanie
                    was always there to - you know, and then I'd finally think of some way, or the
                    people working with me would think of some way to pull the thing off to get it
                    up there.</p>
                <p>I think I mentioned before in Western Batteries when we made a profit in
                    February, it was only $500 or $568 or something - it was something like that,
                    and I remember getting the phone call from Red Denning, the accountant, on a
                    Saturday to tell me we'd made money in February. That was one of our goals in
                    that business.</p>
                <p>But I don't know, it's just that I've seen a certain firmness in thaIrwin line
                    that I don't see elsewhere sometimes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's that common expression that behind every great
                        mathere's a great woman.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>GREEN: Well, and I think as far as I'm concerned, if you look at it, that's
                    right. I mean, I had a chance to marry other people, I suppose. As I say, I
                    think earlier on I didn't even want to get married. I was afraid to, mainly
                    because of money. I was just scared stiff of it.</p>
                <p>But you're right. And later on in life - and we'll cover Romania, of course, and
                    the FMC, and even Port of Portland, you want to cover that, I noticed - when I
                    got into a kind of semi-public life, quasi-public life, I mean, Joan was just
                    perfect. People loved her, everywhere. I mean, really loved her - because she
                    loved them. And you know, that was a great thing for me. She didn't try to be
                    political. She was as nice to the upstairs maid as she was to the British
                    ambassador, for example. I'm not sure she wasn't nicer.</p>
                <p>Joanie and I have always felt that way about people, and we've taughour children
                    that. And I think our grandchildren picked it up.</p>
                <p>I got a letter the other day - I maybe should have brought it up and shown it to
                    you - from Paneit, my driver in Bucharest. It's a beautiful letter. And I copied
                    it and sent it to the children because they were over there and saw him.</p>
                <p>But you know, it's amazing if you can do a favor for a person that's really
                    having a tough time. It doesn't have to be a monetary, a big monetary or
                    something, just do something for them, say hello to them, something like that,
                    it's amazing what it does. “Geez, the ambassador said hello to me.” You know,
                    that sort of thing. It means something to them.</p>
                <p>It's a funny thing, I came back to Oregon - I'm kind of rambling now, but I came
                    back to Oregon because I had a chance to do some things in Washington, as I
                    said, being a talking head and that sort of thing on television, but I just
                    wanted to get back here. And the people - they don't call you “Ambassador” here.
                    As a matter of fact, when they do, they laugh when they do it and that sort of
                    thing. That's what I kind of wanted. I didn't want to get too much undue
                    attention.</p>
                <p>Now, I'm going to France in June, and you can be darn sure the hotel in Paris
                    knows I'm an ambassador, and I got a pretty good room - and the air show was on;
                    Paris is packed, but I got in. I mean, there are a lot of advantages to this
                    title, as a matter of fact, but you don't use it around Portland, Oregon, I can
                    tell you.</p>
                <p>Q: Living up here and having wealth, have you felt a separation from other people
                    in the community? There's a separation between the East Side and the West Hills
                    and that sort of thing. What has that meant to you and your family?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, I suppose so. But I've always lived up here. I mean, without wealth I
                    had lived here as a boy. Lived on Talbot Road, less than a mile away.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>And this is being taped in my home, by the way. We ought to notthat on the
                    tape.</p>
                <p>But oh, you don't like to think it's that way, but I suppose that there's a
                    separation. I get pretty disgusted with some things I see sometimes that I
                    should be more understanding of, I suppose.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, I don't know. You know, that's a good question. I shouldn't have said
                    it unless I've got something to back it up. Things sometimes you read in the
                    paper that go on up here, and they go on in other sections of Portland, and
                    elsewhere in other cities and things like that, and I just say, “That's kind of
                    stupid,” you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we'll have an opportunity to get into the issues
                        becauswe'll be talking about politics, for one thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. But I think the fact that mainly I have made my money - I'm intensely
                    proud of that fact; it means a lot to me. Now, I made it with the guarantees, a
                    couple of times, of my wife. So you know, that's where it essentially
                    intermixes. But I am intensely proud of that.</p>
                <p>So I have always felt that I could understand somebody that's, say, a teacher or
                    somebody that's trying to do something, and there's not a lot of money involved
                    in what they're doing, but they're doing so much good. I think we've covered
                    that. Those are the people I admire - I mean truly admire. I admire you, Jim. I
                    think it's terrific what you're doing, and it will mean, I hope, a lot to my
                    family and to some other people who might be dear to me.</p>
                <p>Q: Why don't we get into that very major subject in your life of the alcoholism
                    experience? If you could offer an idea of what was happening to you when you
                    began to get into alcohol in a problematic way.</p>
                <p>GREEN: I always drank a lot in college. As a matter of fact, I was called
                    “Alcohol Al,” and my roommate was “Boozy Bob” Forbes. He's okay. He went on to
                    Parade magazine, and he's been able to handle his booze.</p>
                <p>I didn't drink a great deal until about really - I suppose my sophomore year at
                    Stanford was when I started because I was running track, the two-mile, and I got
                    lapped by Roland Sink in the Los Angeles Coliseum in the two-mile; he went by me
                    like I was standing still. And I said, “This is not for me.”</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>So I went with a couple or three buddies who were down there watching this thing,
                    and they thought it was hilarious, and so I went with them to a bar and started
                    smoking and drinking - beer, mainly, at that time. And the coach, Jack
                    Weiehaeuser, I think his name was, he came in, and he said, “What are you
                    doing?” And I said, “I'm never going to be any good at this thing. I think I'll
                    just lead a normal life.” And I said, “Let me buy you a beer,” and I bought him
                    a beer, and that was the end of that athletic experience. Because I was very
                    fast a Lincoln High School. As I indicated, I almost won the quarter-mile; I
                    almost had the record.</p>
                <p>But anyway, then the booze just started flowing. I drank a lot in the insurance
                    business. We used to go to the University Club, a bunch of us, and we'd meet
                    there on Saturday, and I used to come home Saturday afternoon quite stiff. You
                    know, it was awful tough on Joan.</p>
                <p>And then it got to a point where I needed it. I mean, I thought I could break it
                    off, but I found out I couldn't. And on July the 3rd, 1962, I was driving to the
                    beach - I almost had a passenger, which I'm glad I didn't, for God's sakes, but
                    I almost did, a young girl, a daughter of a friend of ours - but a cop pulled me
                    over on 101 right at the tunnel, just after the tunnel. And he really roughed me
                    up and put me in the back of his car, threw me in the back of his car. He was
                    really sore at guys like me - and I don't blame him.</p>
                <p>And he took me back to Hillsboro, and somebody came and got my car, I guess. But
                    anyway, he took me back to Hillsboro and put me in jail. And I spent a night in
                    that jail; it's probably as bad a night as I've ever spent in my life, but I
                    deserved it. And I said to myself, “Okay, you're either going up or down, one of
                    the two. You don't have any choice.”</p>
                <p>So I called Joanie, and she was very sad I think I went over the George Goforth
                    and that with the other tape. But then I went to Raleigh Hills Hospital, and was
                    a successful patient there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You knew about them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. Yes, I knew Larry Haydon at the time. He and I later on had some
                    difficulties because I became an owner in Raleigh Hills. And I'll tell you one
                    thing, it had - Spike Hennessy was the name of the third party that owned it,
                    and you never want to do this in business; you never want to have a unanimity
                    clause. It worked to Spike's and my advantage. Larry would come up with some
                    terrible ideas, and I could just stop it because it wasn't unanimous; we just
                    invoked the unanimity rule. But never get involved where there's a unanimity
                    rule.</p>
                <p>But anyway, we were, and it worked to our advantage.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>I remember one thing - you talk about Joan, you know - this is 1962, when people
                    weren't talking much about the booze. There was plenty of alcoholism around, but
                    it was kind of in the closet, so to speak. So Joanie said when I got out - she
                    came out to see me, and we had a very emotional meeting at Raleigh Hills. And
                    then she came out and drove me home - here, to this house. And she said, “Are
                    you going to be all right? I'm going to the beach.” I said, “Yes, I'll be all
                    right. I'll see you on Friday.” This was Monday or something like that.</p>
                <p>And people thought she was crazy to leave me alone, and it was thbest thing she
                    could have done.</p>
                <p>We have Mrs. Johnson here, Mrs. Bertha T. Johnson, who I have mentioned. And
                    she's the one that was really mad at me. And I finally said, “Cool it, Mrs.
                    Johnson. I'm not going to have another drink.” But you know, she'd had bad
                    experiences with men. I mean, not sexually, but you know, I think beat her up or
                    something.</p>
                <p>But anyway, so it wasn't a problem. I was thinking all the time about it. And
                    then I drove down at the weekend, and we started a new beginning.</p>
                <p>I had an interesting experience. There is a fellow named Jim MacGregor, who in
                    1962 was a great athlete. He is a great friend of mine now, but wasn't that good
                    a friend at that time. He's a polo player, and he was playing polo in Lake
                    Oswego, and the horse went over on him, and he became severely handicapped.</p>
                <p>So he had to change his life. And they have a place right opposite where we were
                    renting at the time, down at Gearhart. So I went over to see him, and I said,
                    “You know, I think you and I have something in common. You can still drink, and
                    I don't want to ride a horse, but we've both got to change our lives. Why don't
                    we do it together? We might make it easier on both of us.”</p>
                <p>And we did. And he, of course, has become a wonderful friend, and he's still
                    around. I saw him last night. But you know, he's had to make a tremendous
                    adjustment, as his family has. But they have. They've all gathered around and
                    supported him, just like my family has gathered around in support of me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had paralysis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, he's partially paralyzed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall what things Joanie said to you at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>GREEN: Well, she made it very plain that if I had another drink that the marriage
                    was over, and the daughters, and everything was through. And I agreed with her.
                    I said, “Well, that's pretty tough medicine, and I think that's what it's all
                    about. But you're right.”</p>
                <p>I didn't have to give up smoking at that time. I've always admired people that do
                    them both. I didn't. I gave it up years later. And I'll tell you one thing,
                    giving up smoking was a lot tougher for me than giving up drinking. A lot
                    tougher, because - you know, there wasn't the social stigma that - I mean, when
                    you're drunk, you're drunk, and everybody knows it. It's bad.</p>
                <p>I don't see drunken behavior as much anymore. Every once in while I help people.
                    I became an owner in Raleigh Hills, and it merged into Comprehensive Care - ends
                    up in Comprehensive Care. And we were making an awful lot of money, quite
                    frankly.</p>
                <p>One thing to go back, I was thinking this morning, it's kind of interesting, I
                    was a Boy Scout, and the man who flunked me for my Red Cross merit badge so I
                    couldn't become a Life Scout, I guess it is, was Dr. Montague, who was the
                    doctor at Raleigh Hills Hospital later on. I told him that story. He's since
                    died. But I've always thought of that as being a coincidence - a First Class
                    scout is as far as I went.</p>
                <p>But we had a very difficult management time. We used to meet in an accountant by
                    the name of Bob McFarland's office. Spike and I always voted together, just
                    because we happened to agree. And Larry would come down and read things that his
                    wife, I think, had written; I don't know. But anyway, he'd read this stuff to
                    us, and it was weird.</p>
                <p>And then finally we got an offer, but we got an offer from two bad people. But we
                    took it - anything to get out of this thing we were in. And they were bad. They
                    were from California. They weren't bad guys; they were very nice guys, as far as
                    that goes, but they just didn't have the same ethics that I had.</p>
                <p>I went on the board of this thing called Neuro Psychiatric and Health Services,
                    and we went public on a best efforts basis. Best efforts means that if you don't
                    make it, it's all - you know, you see these IPOs or things going out now - does
                    that mean anything to you? Are you interested in that sort of thing?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, but go ahead.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, IPOs are new investments, they're bringing them out in the market.
                    Anyway, so we did this on a best efforts basis and made it. And Harvey Black,
                    right across the street, was alive at the time, and he bought some stock, I'll
                    never forget it, at $6 a share, I think it was, and it went to $8, and I told
                    him to sell it. I said, “We've got problems in this company.” But he helped us
                    get over the hump with the offering.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>Well, he did, and for a long time he was the only guy I knew thamade any money on
                    the stock.</p>
                <p>And then a fellow - and you should put this down - a fellow by the name of Lee
                    Karns, and this is where Stanford kind of comes into play, too. I didn't know
                    what we were going to do in this company. But there was a company that was
                    interested in our company and interested in the concept. And it was...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the Neuro Company?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: The Neuro Company. Petrolane, and the guy that ran it was a guy named Rudy
                    Munser. But he had under him the president of that company, was a fellow named
                    John Wallace, who was a fraternity brother of mine at Stanford, a Phi Delt. I
                    rushed him, as a matter of fact. We got him. And he was looking over this list.
                    He sent a guy over named Lee Karns, B. Lee Karns, K-a-r-n-s, a very key guy in
                    my life.</p>
                <p>They brought back to John Wallace, a list, and he looked down the list of the
                    board of directors, and he says, “Alan Green from Portland, Oregon. Does he have
                    a nickname?”</p>
                <p>Lee says, “Yes, I think they call him Punch.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Go ahead with this. It's going to be all right.” And that's from
                    Stanford. That started it, and they bought it. We got rid of these other guys.
                    We made all these changes and almost went broke.</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact, at one time the IRS was on its way over to shut us down
                    because we hadn't paid our taxes, and Lee had the money - I said, “What are you
                    doing?” He says, “I'm going to give them a check when they get here.” And he
                    did. I mean, it was dramatic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They picked up their check.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: They picked up their check. And then we started going, and it really - we
                    didn't have any competition, particularly. The concept was brand new, and we
                    were opening - we called it Comprehensive Care Corporation, we changed the name.
                    Neuro was the predecessor to Comprehensive Care.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Neuro's relationship to Raleigh Hills?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>GREEN: Well, when Raleigh Hills merged, we had to merge it into something. We
                    merged it into Neuro Psychiatric and Health Services. And they had a couple of
                    little rest homes and things.</p>
                <p>They had one very good hospital in Calabassas, California, as matter of fact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Raleigh Hills, when it started up was it independent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then this company began to acquire the
                        properties?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. But they didn't have any money backing it. I mean, wwere the greatest
                    thing in the world because we did it for stock.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem with the new people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Actually, they were nice people. Let's put it this way: Their ethics
                    weren't my ethics. I don't know how to say it with it going into writing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were not good partners and...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: They were not good partners, no. They weren't the right people. And when
                    Lee Karns and all that, when that came in, I jumped at it. And as a matter of
                    fact, another fellow, John Hall, and I were the only ones left on the Board of
                    Directors of the new Comprehensive Care Corporation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you go about clearing the board so that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: When they took over, they just let them go, fired them. Saino. I mean, “We
                    want you, Punch, and we want you, John, and that's it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. When the new company was formed?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. But they had a tough time. We got some help from the others, but then
                    we had an awful time fixing the company so it was profitable. Then it became
                    highly profitable, and it became huge, as a matter of fact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it moved into other areas besides alcoholism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, not really. No, that was the prime thing, yes. Well, Lee tried to get
                    involved with home health care and things like that. Medical Care International
                    was a company which I made a great deal of money in because Lee let me get into
                    it as a forming unit, and it ended up as Columbia Health Care System, and it's
                    been in the papers lately. I sold my share several years ago.</p>
                <p>What I've done is when I get this huge profit in these companies, I just bail out
                    and put them in bonds and stocks and things like that. I mean, it's very tough
                    to sell a stock you've authored. To buy a stock's very easy; to sell a stock's
                    very difficult because - but I figure the next guy, he just can't make as much
                    as I made on this thing. If I think ahead, I should sell it, and I did.</p>
                <p>And you know, as you get older - I have a theory about getting older, you get
                    safer. I don't want to go back to work, for example. I want to be able to
                    provide for my family and make them very comfortable.</p>
                <p>Q: You know, I think it would be a good idea to go back to your experience and
                    maybe find the link between it and the moving into the company. I would like to
                    go back to your experience in Raleigh Hills and then go to those moments when
                    you actually began to work on Raleigh Hills with Raleigh Hills as an investment.
                    But I would like to actually go back to your actual experience, going through
                    the treatment. What was that experience for you? (End of tape)</p>
                <p>You took yourself down there as soon as the weekend was over or...</p>
                <p>GREEN: No, they came and got me. Larry Hayden came and got me out of the jail. He
                    said, “Have you had enough?” I remember that, and I said, “Yes.” So he drove me
                    down to Raleigh Hills.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you know about him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I knew about him through the Portland Executives Association, of which at
                    one time I was president. It's a group from a lot of companies around town. It's
                    a wonderful group, and Raleigh Hills Hospital was a member of that.</p>
                <p>Larry and I were friends before this thing started. I knew him well.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had he ever said anything to you about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, I talked to him about it once. I got worried about it once, and he
                    talked me out it. He says, “No, I don't think you are, but let's watch it.” And
                    they needed patients. Man, they needed patients. There were only about four or
                    five when I got in there.</p>
                <p>But I'll tell you one thing, the experiences - after my conversation with Joan
                    and George Goforth, I really just felt good. I knew that I was in for a tough
                    time, but I thought I could do it, and that sort of thing. They give you these
                    treatments where they give you a shot of something that closes off your stomach,
                    then they make you sick from booze. But it can't get it into your system, you
                    heave. It's a pretty rough treatment. I've forgotten what they call it now. But
                    it worked for me.</p>
                <p>I sometimes wonder if I even needed it, but I did it because that convinced
                    people that, I was doing the right thing, and after all, perception's a lot of
                    this stuff. I knew I wasn't going to take another drink. I just knew that
                    personally. I wasn't going to do it. Had too much to lose, and it wasn't worth
                    it.</p>
                <p>I've often thought, I'll tell you, one of the things that - I was always
                    surprised at the people who had gone to Raleigh Hills, and once I became an
                    owner, I looked at the previous - it's a Who's Who in this area, quietly said.
                    And then I'd see people out there. I'd get a call that a friend of mine was out
                    there, and I'd go out and see him.And before I was an owner and after I was an
                    owner, I'd intervene and make people feel comfortable. Recently, I even had one
                    now who talks about it, Bob Atkinson. I have his permission to use his name.
                    Raleigh Hills is no more, but they sent Bob down to Newberg, I guess it is;
                    they've got a facility down there. It's a lot tougher than when I went through
                    it, I can tell you that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, it is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I think it is. I mean, boy. But whatever it takes. And they play
                    very much to the Alcoholics Anonymous, and I didn't do that. I didn't have to do
                    that. It really wasn't suggested. I've only been to one Alcoholics Anonymous
                    meeting in my life, and that was to meet Wilbur Mills in Washington, DC. because
                    I needed some help in getting the Shipping Act of 1985 passed, and Wilbur Mills
                    made a few calls for me. So as the world turns, as we say, eh? You just have to
                    pick up your opportunities.</p>
                <p>That's imagination, and that's something I've always had, is a little
                    imagination. I'd say, “No, no, there are other ways to do this thing,” and that
                    sort of thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>But I enjoyed talking to people and going out, and I'd put on an act. Actually,
                    I'm kind of an actor. I used to be in the Junior League Cabaret, and I'd have a
                    lot of fun in that, song and dance and that sort of thing. And Dad had a lot of
                    that in him. He was absolutely fantastic when he got on the stage, before he was
                    having problems. I never saw it, but boy, I've heard about it.</p>
                <p>Talking to potential patients, I would put on different acts depending upon, I'd
                    either be a nice guy or I'd be a son-of-a-bitch, you know, depending upon what
                    it called for. Because I've often said, people with a booze problem, you're as
                    tough as you can be until you seek treatment and admit that you're an alcoholic
                    - that's the biggest thing is admitting it, admitting it to yourself. Not just
                    saying it - I mean, do you actually realize you're an alcoholic and can't have
                    any more booze, that's it, it's over. Once you get there, then you give them all
                    the sympathy and the love and affection you can possibly bequeath. And that's
                    how I did it.</p>
                <p>There are a lot of people walking around now that I'm proud have got their lives,
                    families and everything. But the wife or the husband plays an enormous role in
                    this thing. I've spent a lot of time with wives, mainly, telling them, “Listen,
                    you've got to forget about the kind of guy he was if he's going to do this. If
                    you bring up things that will make him ashamed of himself, of what he did,
                    you're going to send him right back to booze. You just can't do it; they're
                    tender at this stage. They need sympathy and love. And if you can't do that,
                    just separate, just don't even try to do it.”</p>
                <p>You've got to watch it an awful lot because you're dealing with another person's
                    real life. You're not taking a contract away from them or something like that,
                    you're dealing with their relationships and how they are in their life, and if
                    you're successful, it's an enormously wonderful thing. And you can't tell
                    anybody; you keep it to yourself. They know, and you know. If they want to talk
                    about it, that's fine, but I can't say a word. It's the way it should be.</p>
                <p>And as I think I have mentioned on the tapes, to treat an extrovert's a lot
                    easier than to treat an introvert. Introverts just keep it to themselves, you
                    can't draw them out. An extrovert doesn't mind because it's the easiest thing in
                    the world to say, “I'm an alcoholic,” you know. It's easy. The key is mean
                    it.</p>
                <p>And of course now, in 1999, everybody understands it. In 1962 everybody didn't
                    understand it. We finally got it declared a sickness and covered by insurance.
                    We had a lot to do with that.</p>
                <p>Q: In the state legislature?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. And then we got it for Medicare and things like that. You know, this
                    big important thing. We got Blue Cross. I got Blue Cross finally to admit to
                    guarantee half of it, go half and half. That was a big breakthrough, big
                    breakthrough, that it's a sickness. And it is a sickness.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who helped you at the legislature?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, gosh, I can't remember who helped me. But I mean, you know, I knew all
                    of the people and they were - I'll tell you a guy that helped me a lot always
                    was Tom McCall.</p>
                <p>But it was mainly this Blue Cross; it was not the legislature so much, but Blue
                    Cross. If we could get Blue Cross, the largest provider at that time, certainly,
                    of health care needs in Oregon, and probably the United States, if we could get
                    them - and they singled out Oregon as a kind of a test state. I was trying to
                    get full coverage, but I couldn't get it. But they said, “Well, let's start it
                    with half.” I said, “All right.” I wasn't going to argue with them. And we
                    did.</p>
                <p>And it worked out well because it works to their advantage. Because I said, “Look
                    at the drunks you are insuring. I mean, they're going to be in an accident,
                    they're going to do all sorts of things. They're going to cost you a lot more
                    than say seven or eight hundred dollars” - I think it cost $1400, maybe, to go
                    through the whole treatment at that time - I said, “seven or eight hundred
                    dollars of your money now, and you're through with it. And if they take another
                    drink, they're not covered.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they have much difficulty in understanding that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, they had difficulty for a while because they're a large
                    organization, and they're - you know, it's a bureaucracy at work. But finally
                    they did it in Oregon to test it out, and it worked out beautifully for
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember about when that happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, let's see, I sobered up in '62. I'd say '69, '70, ithere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, pretty early, really?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. Well, when did I became an owner? That's when I becaminterested in
                    it. Probably '70, maybe, '69, '70.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tom McCall was a man who had a lot of difficulty with
                        alcohol,too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, but he could turn it off.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you aware of that at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Not particularly. He was so charming. Tom could put it on pretty good. But
                    he had two guys that made his administration. Tom was very important to it, but
                    without Ed Westerdahl and Ron Schmidt, Tom wouldn't have been near as effective
                    - and he had their total loyalty. And they're two of the smartest, nicest guys
                    I've ever known in my life. Particularly - I mean, Ron Schmidt I adored. I
                    remember when he was - you know, he became terribly successful, and I had to get
                    people to do things for me, lawyers and things like that, when I was going into
                    government, in the background search, and I needed a kind of a bio done of me.
                    So I went to see Ron about it, and he did a magnificent job. I said, “I want it
                    short; I don't want a long one.” So he gave it to me in a couple, three days.
                    Everybody else would charge me, you know. I said, “How much do I owe you for
                    this?” He said, “Nothing. I'm glad you're doing it for the country.” I mean,
                    that's the kind of guy Ron Schmidt was.And Ed Westerdahl is still around. I
                    don't see much of Ed, but boy, I think he's as smart a guy as I've ever known in
                    my life. I've often thought that Vic Atiyeh was probably the best governor we've
                    ever had, and I base that mainly because he had to govern when the state was
                    having a tough time economically. The times were tough. It's not the governor's
                    fault - people have to blame somebody, but it isn't the governor of the state
                    that's at fault.</p>
                <p>But anyway - and I wasn't here much during that time, but I'd heard about it
                    because I was in Washington or that sort of thing. But I think the
                    McCall-Westerdahl-Schmidt had to be the best combination any state ever had.
                    Nobody could ever improve upon that. It was just awesome.</p>
                <p>You talk about Tom - I mean, boy, they'd cover him. He was covered.There was
                    total loyalty between the governor and those guys.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it doesn't take anything away from McCall, I don't
                        think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, I don't think it should, because he had the ideas and he had the guts
                    to stand up and do these things that a lot of people didn't want done.</p>
                <p>Once I was working late in his office on his campaign - or I was working during
                    the day or something. It was a Saturday. I was his finance chairman, and Ed
                    Westerdahl asked me to do it. And I said, “You know I just got out of Raleigh
                    Hills Hospital a little while ago. I mean, people don't have a lot of faith in
                    me. I've got a lot of pressures. You sure you want me to do it?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Yes, it'll be good for you. You'll do a good job, and iwill help
                    you.”</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>And I said I would. So I did, and I did a good job, damn it. I dia very good job
                    for him, and I enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>I'll never forget, Owen Cheatham was the founder of Georgia-Pacific Corporation,
                    his funeral was in town, in Portland - or a memorial to him or something. It was
                    huge. And Tom McCall came in the office before it, and he said, “Would you like
                    to go to the funeral with me, Punch?”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Yes, I would, Governor.” I think he was governor then.“I would,
                    Tom.”</p>
                <p>And so I rode with him, and he sat - I don't sit on the right-hanside in the
                    back. Tom sat on the right-hand side in the back.</p>
                <p>But anyway, so we went to the funeral together. And the cream of Portland was
                    there, of course - or whoever, I mean, all the leaders were there, and you know,
                    they saw me with him. And that kind of helped me a little bit. I mean, I was
                    working my way up, I'm political enough to know that. The vibes were right.</p>
                <p>So we got in the car afterwards, and Tom had a bad cold, and we were driving back
                    to his headquarters downtown, and little kids were waving to him, and he was
                    waving to them. And I said, “Governor, are you sure that what you've got is a
                    cold? Are you sure it's not the clap?”</p>
                <p>Tom said, as he was waving to the little girls and boys, “I wish it were, Punch,
                    I wish it were.” [laughing] I've never forgotten it. It reminded me of W.C.
                    Fields, remember, waving to the children and saying awful things under his
                    breath to them. And I tell you, I just howled.</p>
                <p>But anyway, he was wonderful, and so is Vic Atiyeh.</p>
                <p>Q: The interesting thing about Tom McCall, when he was governor, I think he was
                    kind like an FDR, in a way. In one special way: He kind of betrayed his class.
                    He was a Republican, and yet he was so angry when he wanted to raise the
                    corporate income tax and so forth, and he would swear and say, “These guys are
                    making money, and they're not paying their share.” What about that aspect of
                    McCall?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, I suppose. I was young, you know, pretty young. Yes, I suppose at the
                    Arlington Club they were going pretty strong at him, but he was still a
                    Republican. He still would come - you know, a lot of times what people say are
                    not things that are done. They say it for an effect. I mean, Bill Clinton's as
                    good an example as any. I mean, that State of Union speech he made when he was
                    under impeachment, I mean, everybody thought that was wonderful. Well, he didn't
                    promise anything, and nothing came about from it, but he said what they wanted
                    to hear.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>And a lot of that was - I mean, you look at some of McCall Park, and the
                    Willamette River is clean under McCall- I guess they've got to clean it again,
                    but it was just a mess until Tom came along. And the Port of Portland Commission
                    and the Commission of Public Docks was put together, and they asked me to go on
                    that, and I did, and Ed Westerdahl was the first Executive Director of it, and I
                    was supposed to be the swing vote because it was an odd number. And I decided
                    that I was going to support Westerdahl on this thing because I thought he knew
                    more than anybody. Well, we had some awfully good people on that, and it never
                    came down to that.</p>
                <p>Q: Before we get into the Port, let's move back in the same subject and talk
                    about your first footsteps in the direction of politics and in local party
                    organization. I think it's really a valuable thing to have a chance to look at
                    party organization, beginning with the Multnomah County Central Committee.</p>
                <p>GREEN: I was chairman of the Multnomah County Central Committee.How I became
                    involved, I think it was Stan Goodell years ago. And he's no longer alive, but
                    he...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, he's alive.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, Stan, Senior, his dad. Anyway, they asked me - I had been involved in
                    the first United Good Neighbors here under Henry Kuckenberg. Those were my
                    drinking days. But I thought it was a good thing to do, and I'd done a pretty
                    good job on the United Good Neighbors.</p>
                <p>And then - they were just broke. The Republican Party was just plain broke.
                    Didn't have any money anywhere. And I thought that was kind of silly. So Stan
                    Goodell asked me to help - I guess he was the finance chairman at that time.
                    Anyway, I went to work for him. I still had the battery company going.</p>
                <p>Anyway, but on this one, having just come from the United Good Neighbors, I
                    decided what I'd do would be I would organize the Republican Party from a
                    financial standpoint the way the United Good Neighbors was. I'd get the lumber
                    people to do this, I'd get the manufacturers to do this, the doctors to do this,
                    the housewives, and get divisional chairmen.</p>
                <p>Anyway, it ends up we raised $40,000. It was a lot of money in those days. And I
                    went to the Multnomah County Republican Central Committee to tell them about it.
                    And they were very happy, of course, because they were broke. But then they had
                    some people on there that really the Republican Party at that time was more of a
                    knitting group than it was a political party - women just talking, old ladies in
                    tennis shoes. The party itself wasn't very active.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>And I ran to be the chairman, and that was when - let's see, Sig Unander was
                    running for governor against Mark Hatfield, and I was on Unander's side. Sig had
                    been a lifelong friend, and I was Unander's man. Mark Hatfield and I now are
                    very good friends, and we should be good friends because we have a lot in
                    common, and we like each other a lot. But at the time, at the start, it was very
                    rocky because - I mean, Mark won and Sig didn't, and it's the first time that
                    Sig had ever been denied anything in his life, I think, and he ended up in bad
                    shape. I mean, it was kind of a pitiful story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a blow to him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: My word, I'll tell you, a terrible blow.</p>
                <p>So anyway, that was a tough struggle. And I was drinking. I raised enough money
                    to pay off the mail machine that was automatic. We didn't have enough money to
                    update the plates. When Bob Packwood introduced me he said, “He's the only
                    chairman that paid off the debts.”</p>
                <p>I remember one Christmas - Jim Short was the name of the State Chairman in Salem,
                    and the state party didn't have any money. And so I decided on my own that I
                    would go out and see 30 people, see if I could see five a day, everybody's home
                    at Christmas, and ask them for $100 for the Republican Party. And I did, I got
                    30 yeses. A hundred dollars was a reasonable figure. Christmas, everybody wants
                    to give.</p>
                <p>I'll never forget, I called Jim Short up and said, “I'm sending you $1500 today.”
                    And he said, “What?” And he couldn't believe it. And then he started to cry, it
                    meant so much to him. Not blubbering, but a real catch in his voice. And I said,
                    “Well, you need it as much as I do, so let's split it up.”</p>
                <p>And then I left it. It got awfully nasty. I watched some of the Republicans - oh,
                    I'm trying to think of the name of the preacher that was involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Walter Huff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Right. Walter Huff and that group started to come in, the Goldwater group,
                    the far right started to come in. First time I ever saw people with their eyes
                    where they were just hard as nails. I mean, “If you don't believe in what I
                    believe in, you're wrong” type of people. And I couldn't stomach that. I didn't
                    like it, and I decided that I'd support candidates, not the party
                    particularly.</p>
                <p>A lot of us felt that way. Well, we feel that way now. I mean, they come after
                    me, and I say - for example, I'm giving to George W. Bush now.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Sig Unander was known as a liberal Republican, like
                        Hatfield.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I suppose. I like the word “moderate” better. Everybody wants to use
                    the word “liberal” and everybody wants to use the word “conservative.” And I
                    like the word “moderate” because I think “moderate” conveys that you're not on
                    either side.</p>
                <p>I was talking to a guy the other day, and he said he was a good conservative, and
                    I said, “What do you mean by conservative?” Well, he said, you know, he doesn't
                    want to see a lot of money spent ill-advisedly, and things like that, you
                    know.</p>
                <p>And I said, “Well, we all agree with that. Then I'm a conservative,if that's what
                    you mean.”</p>
                <p>But when I think about conservative sometimes, I think about some of these far
                    right, religious far right people. They call themselves conservative, and I'm
                    not for them. I dislike them as much as I dislike the far left. I don't like the
                    far left, either. I don't like either extreme.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The labels become problematic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I think the labels are very confusing. You remember Dukakis, we finally
                    got him to admit he was a liberal. I thought it was silly, but everybody was
                    very triumphant about it because being a liberal was a bad thing to be at that
                    time. Well, he finally said, “I'm a liberal.” Who cares.</p>
                <p>But I think there's a moderate, and I think a moderate means, as far as a
                    Democrat or a Republican - there isn't much difference. There's a difference. I
                    assume that you're a Democrat, and I think I'm right, but that's all right. I
                    think you'd vote for me, and I think I'd vote for you. There's a little
                    difference in emphasis of how you feel, and a lot of it is how you're brought
                    up, you know. My God, Dad voted for Alf Landon against Roosevelt. So did Mother.
                    In those days it was black and white for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you said that you went to different groups, and

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, I just got a chairman, yes, and said, “Can you raise...”- gave them a
                    quote, $2,000 or something.</p>

                <p>GREEN: No, this is for the party. Is this the $40,000 we're talkinabout?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, before you were talking about just in general how
                        you wenout and, following the pattern from United Good Neighbors...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, that was for Stan Goodell and the ultimate $40,000. He was having a
                    tough time, and I said I thought I could raise more dollars so I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So did you do something like, “Your company can handle
                        printing expenses and...”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, no, I was after dollars. I wasn't after in-kind. I'd go down to Bill
                    Swindells, as an example, and I'd say, “Would you handle the lumber industry for
                    me and see if they can get three or four thousand dollars for us, for the
                    Multnomah County Republican Party?”</p>
                <p>You know, at that time - inflation didn't even start until 1969. So in those days
                    when you asked somebody for $1,000, you were asking for the moon.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the other organizations and groups? For instance, one of the big
                    ones was the Young Republicans. Were you connected with that?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Not really, no. I didn't get involved in those. I don'know why, I just
                    never did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dorchester?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Dorchester I went to once for George Bush. I've only been tone of
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Later on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. I let Senator Gordon Smith and a few others use my housdown at
                    Gearhart for Dorchester.</p>
                <p>But no, I was never really involved in city politics, either. I gave a little
                    money to a few of them. I was involved in state politics, and then, of course,
                    national.</p>
                <p>It will probably surprise some of my acquaintances, but I have felt more than
                    once a kindred spirit with a prominent Democrat, Neil Goldschmidt. We have never
                    worked together on any significant project, and we disagree on certain political
                    solutions, but I admire him.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you said you went to some conventions. You went to the
                        SaFrancisco convention?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Where they nominated Barry Goldwater.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could sort of set the scene with how you

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I thought that it didn't make much difference, we were going to lose
                    anyway. I've always been a very practical politician - I mean, not as practical
                    as some of my friends. They will go and support Democrats even if they can't
                    stand them if they think they're going to win. I won't do that; I just
                    won't.</p>
                <p>But anyway, I remember flying home from that convention. I think that Rockefeller
                    was the one that was after it with Goldwater, and they selected Goldwater.
                    Goldwater had a lot of good things. He was way ahead of himself as far as a lot
                    of the far right, but they kind of melded around him, and he became our
                    candidate.</p>
                <p>Flying home, Bob Floweree of Georgia Pacific Corporation was sitting next to me.
                    He was down there on business in San Francisco, and he said, “Aw, I don't like
                    this; this is all politics.” And I said, “You don't play politics at Georgia
                    Pacific? Are you kidding me? It's all the same thing. You've got a big
                    corporation, you're playing politics.” He said, “Well, I guess you're
                    right.”</p>
                <p>Anyway, people think of politics - politics, you've got it every day of your
                    life. I'm trying to be careful of the words I'm using here, and I know I've got
                    a chance to look at them, but I might miss something, too, and out it comes.</p>
                <p>I'll tell you a funny story on Schmidt, Ron Schmidt. Goldwater was visiting, was
                    going to come visit Portland. And so they asked me to head up his visit, and I
                    agreed to do it. It was going to be at the airport, just a flying in type of
                    thing, make some comments at the airport and on his way.</p>
                <p>The night before Goldwater visited, I had a meeting of all the people in charge
                    of it, and Schmidt was helping me with it from the governor's staff, Ron
                    Schmidt. And I got thinking about it and I said, “Ron, what about outhouses and
                    things like that? My god, we're going to have 5,000, 10,000 people out
                    there.”</p>
                <p>He said, “You're right. I'll take care of it. They'll be there.” said, “Good.
                    We'll call them Schmidt houses.”</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>But anyway, that's one of the times when I saw this fervor in people that we
                    hadn't seen before. I remember one guy - Goldwater got in the car, and one guy
                    broke from the crowd and grabbed his hand and wouldn't let go, and the car was
                    moving. And I told the police, “Go over there and break it up.” He said, “How am
                    I going to do that?” I said, “Give him a chop blow on the arm.” I mean, the guy
                    had this look in his eye. He was seeing God, as far as he was concerned.</p>
                <p>Goldwater did some good, and he of course became more mellow - as all of us I
                    suppose, do as we age -. Under Lyndon Johnson, they had a very effective ad, I
                    recall, against Goldwater. They had this atomic bomb, a flower - yes, and then
                    they had Goldwater. So you know -. But Johnson, was that the one that got
                    him?</p>

                <p>GREEN: And it probably killed him . I'll tell you about how Mark almost became
                    President of the United States - should have become. I wish for everybody's sake
                    he had become, but...</p>

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: All right. You'll pick up on that. That was the conventioin Miami.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1968?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. Nixon. And we got in about four o'clock in the morning, mid way
                    through the convention. That's the one where I was a page. I had a little orange
                    jacket. By this time Mark Hatfield and I had become very good friends, and of
                    course Gerry Frank was Mark's #1.</p>
                <p>But anyway, so some reporter at the Oregonian - he and I got to be friends, he
                    died, I can't remember his name - but anyway, we got there about four o'clock in
                    the morning. And at that time, I'm not drinking. I mean, I'm through with the
                    booze. But anyway, it was exciting, and things were going on and everything. But
                    I went back to the hotel. Kenilworth Hotel, that's what it was, and they've
                    since torn it down. And there were huge, just huge television cables snaking all
                    through the lobby. And it was because Mark was staying there, and it was for the
                    Vice President's announcement of the candidate the next day, and everybody
                    assumed it was going to be Mark Hatfield with Nixon.</p>
                <p>And I got up about 10, 11 o'clock in the morning and dressed and went upstairs,
                    and there was nothing there. So I called Gerry Frank. He said, “They spooked the
                    delegates, the Southerners split the delegates and chose a guy named Agnew.” And
                    that's how close Mark came to being Vice President, and of course, President -
                    they would not have had to get rid of Mark Hatfield to get to President Nixon.
                    They would have been very happy to have Mark. In Agnew you had a guy that takes
                    a $3,000 bribe in public office.</p>
                <p>The system does work, in spite of all of its illnesses. In spite of all the
                    troubles we have, it does work. Look at what the country's going through right
                    now. It's fantastic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Billy Graham played a part in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, Billy Graham. That's where Mark Hatfield was thamorning. He went to
                    Billy Graham, I guess, and prayed.</p>
                <p>There's one I have admired: Billy Graham. I don't admire some othe others, but I
                    admire Billy Graham very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know Billy Graham?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No. Met him once, but no. But I admire him. He's genuine.That's the
                    difference.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, Travis Cross. Marvelous man. Yes, Travis and I werPhi Delts together
                    at Stanford.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, really. At the same time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, he was a transfer. He went to Willamette, I think, anthen came down
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was he like in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, he was wonderful. Actually, I think you could have picked Travis out
                    to do what he did at that time. He was that kind of a person. He was going to be
                    in politics and background politics, really.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what were your feelings about what happened to
                        Rockefeller,Rockefeller being left behind by the party?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I liked Nelson Rockefeller. Not because he was Nelson Rockefeller; I
                    knew that was probably against him because the average person probably wouldn't
                    like him.</p>
                <p>But the first time, I was for Henry Cabot Lodge, and Nelson Rockefeller - that's
                    when the Oregon primary meant something, in those days. Walter Cronkite came out
                    for it, and it was exciting. And Henry Cabot Lodge was the ambassador to
                    Vietnam, I think it was, or something like that. And Rockefeller came to Oregon.
                    He was running. And Dick Turner was the guy - a very smart advertising fellow.
                    He's since passed away. But he came up with a slogan, “He cared enough to come
                    to Oregon,” and the slogan just sunk us.</p>
                <p>And then the next time I went with Rockefeller because I liked him. And that's
                    when Nixon - matter of fact I went back in the plane, Bob Noyes and a couple of
                    us, went back in the plane with Dick Turner to get Rockefeller to convince him
                    to run against Nixon in Oregon, and Pat Nixon was on the plane. And we went up
                    to Rockefeller's penthouse, but we didn't get him to come to Oregon. He didn't
                    do it.</p>
                <p>But I liked him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your observations of and your feelings about
                        Nixon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I watched the debate where Kennedy - people would say to listen to them on
                    the radio, Nixon won the debate, but there wasn't any question who won the
                    debate when you watched it. I mean, Nixon needed a shave every five minutes, you
                    know, and Kennedy was extremely smooth.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>I don't know. I suppose I should be outraged by Nixon. I'm not. I think he did a
                    lot of good. I know this, that every Democrat that was President used him as
                    much as they possibly could; he'd come in the back door of the White House many
                    times to give them some advice particularly on foreign policy.</p>
                <p>He had a streak, I guess, about him that was bad. I mean, the only thing I had
                    was the East-West Center, and that was just a complimentary thing, and actually
                    we did a lot of good on it, but that was just a nice thing that somebody got me
                    for some of the work that I'd done in the political venues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, that came about as result of work in the national
                        campaign?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: We had Hatfield and Packwood. We had very powerful guys. Wendell Wyatt was
                    a powerful guy, and a very close, dear friend of mine. So we had power back
                    there. Small state, but we had power.</p>
                <p>Yes, they got me on this thing, and that was under Nixon. Do yowant to talk about
                    that just a little bit, or not?</p>
                <p>Q: Let's hold that for later when we have more time. What were the issues that
                    really exercised you, say, in the '60s? There were a lot of things happening in
                    the '60s.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, you had Vietnam and all of that.</p>
                <p>Q: JFK, and the turnaround in the economy after the recession at the end of the
                    Eisenhower period and the way JFK went about it in Vietnam. And then there's the
                    civil unrest, and the civil rights movement. It's certainly interesting, you can
                    look back into the period and you'll notice that everything lines up - say,
                    looking at Nixon, for instance, his resignation kind of covers everything else.
                    So I'm trying to get back to the times and how you saw things as you were going
                    along.</p>
                <p>GREEN: It's hard to say how you see things as you go along. In the '60s, let me
                    put it to you this way, maybe it was a selfish stage in my life. Because things
                    were starting to sizzle. Kennedy said the '60s would sizzle. Those were his
                    words, and he was right - for me, at least, for Punch Green. The businesses were
                    starting to go. I was sober, and I was getting - you know, after '62 things
                    started to happen in the economy.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>So you know, we didn't have Vietnam at the time. Everybody was preoccupied in the
                    '70s with it, I guess, and late '60s.But in Oregon, you know, that's another
                    thing that a lot of people don't realize. You're living in Oregon. People back
                    East, they couldn't understand why I wouldn't stay in Washington, DC. after my
                    stint as ambassador, and trying to explain to them, “I just want to go
                    home.”</p>
                <p>But you are far away from the their idea of action, like, for example, I was
                    talking to a person in Washington just the other day, and they were saying, “Can
                    you believe Clinton is doing...” And I said, “What are you talking about?” I
                    didn't know anything about it. I mean, it had to do with NATO and that sort of
                    thing, and I said, “That doesn't hit our papers as front page news.”</p>
                <p>If you live there, it becomes so - I mean, we had Vietnam and things like that,
                    but I said to my daughter Carter when she was at Williams College - she was in
                    the second group of women that went to Williams College. I'm very proud of her.
                    And there wasn't any demonstration; just one guy out on the football field, you
                    know, smoking a pipe or something. And I said, “You're lucky because these are
                    the best years of your life, and you don't have all this mess that you're having
                    at Kent State and all these other places, California and Stanford.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about the Vietnam War?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, I think I supported it most of the time. I'm mostly “my country, right
                    or wrong.” That's the way I was brought up. Since I've learned that the people
                    that were doing the protesting were mostly right. McNamara and that group led us
                    down the wrong path, but I didn't know that. I was mad at Mark Hatfield for a
                    long time because I thought he should support it; ends up that was a very
                    courageous thing for him to do.</p>
                <p>So I think I was wrong. But it's awfully difficult - at least for me and my
                    generation - to not support our country. I mean, I'm having a difficult time
                    right now with our role in Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>Q: Back in the '50s, earlier in your political development, one of the really
                    electric things that happened in the '50s is the defection of Wayne Morse, when
                    Howard Morgan and Monroe Sweetland got their party organization going, and they
                    got Morse turned around. Do you remember what that meant to you at the time?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, boy, I certainly do. I'll tell you what it meant to me mainly was my
                    father- in-law, Howard Irwin, was so incensed that he and a couple other
                    lumberman ran a guy named Dave Hoover - as I recall; I think it was Deadwood
                    Dave Hoover - against Wayne Morse. And of course he had no chance.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>But my father-in-law had a bad heart, and he was upset with Wayne Morse. And I'll
                    tell you another man in town that was mad at Wayne Morse was Edward C. Sammons,
                    because he'd gone all out in support of Wayne Morse - and he was an awfully nice
                    guy, but he was very in love with himself, I think - as opposed to Glenn
                    Jackson, who put on a better act than Edward C. Sammons. Anyway, Howard Irwin
                    was just mad, and therefore, I was mad. I mean, after all, I'm at an
                    impressionable age and I have just married Joan Irwin, and I was pretty mad,
                    too. So I'm going out and doing all I can to see that Wayne Morse, that awful
                    person is defeated. I still don't particularly admire Wayne Morse. I don't mind
                    people that change stripes, but they've got to have a better reason than that -
                    more registered Democrats than Republicans in the state.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Historians writing about Morse say that his reason for
                        departinthe party was his reaction to Robert Taft.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Could be. Huh. That's interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you aware of Robert Taft in those days? GREEN:

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did Taft mean to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I thought he was a fine leader. As I recall, he wasn't a colorful man at
                    all. He had the wire glasses type of thing. I didn't think much of him, but
                    Taft's from Ohio. I was more a do-it person. I don't sit around and read books
                    all day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I don't think anybody at the time really understood
                        whMorse left.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I just told you - more Democrats than Republicans in the state.</p>
                <p>I'll never forget when Bob Packwood beat him. God Almighty, that was a
                    celebration! And then they challenged it, and Bob asked me to go down to this
                    huge auditorium where they were re-counting the ballots. And so I got about
                    eight or ten people together and went down there. And if a person had just
                    marked a little bit off, they challenged it, when it was obvious they were
                    either voting for Packwood or Morse, and you could tell. But they were
                    challenging it.</p>
                <p>So finally I looked up - it was silly after about an hour, so I looked up the guy
                    who was my counterpart, and he was a good guy, the Democrat, and I said, “Why
                    don't we really be reasonable about when they challenge when it's obvious you
                    can't tell, let's challenge that.” I said, “I will guarantee you I will
                    challenge as many ballots as you challenge. I totally guarantee you that.”</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>He said, “You're kidding.” I said, “No, I'm not kidding. I plajust as tough as
                    you do. This is my game, too.”</p>
                <p>And so he said, “Okay,” and we did. And it didn't make any difference.And I'll
                    tell you who had a lot to do with Packwood winning was Bob Warren and Nani
                    Warren, they backed him up. They gave him some money and gave him some help when
                    he needed it. And I've had differences of opinion with them, but they were sure
                    there when Bob Packwood needed them.</p>

                    with people here. I mean, it's a big issue in the South, it's a big issue in
                    Washington, DC. It's not an issue here. We're getting along pretty well, I
                    think. I mean, we've got a black here at my home, Jan, and she's wonderful, and
                    we talk about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [How did you come to the] East-west Center?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I'll tell you, it's an interesting story. The government, you, the
                    taxpayer, paid my flight to Hawaii and back about three or four times a year for
                    about - well, three times a year for about two or three years. And boy, it got
                    to be a milk run. You know, I'd stay at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel, and Clare
                    Booth Luce and people like that were on the committee. We'd sometimes go to
                    Washington and have a meeting there - unfortunately.</p>
                <p>Anyway, then I'd usually stay over a week. Joanie come over, yoknow, at our
                    expense, and we'd vacation.</p>
                <p>But anyway, it's an interesting thing. When we got there, there was a fellow
                    named John MacGiver, a lawyer who lives in Wisconsin, who's the only guy I know
                    in Wisconsin, and he's a brilliant man. He introduced me to a man who - Tommy
                    Thompson, who is the governor of Wisconsin. I met him in New Orleans, at the
                    convention - and there's a governor who is doing well and should advance.But
                    anyway, John MacGiver and I became friends. And we were noticing that there was
                    quite a bit the government had spent at the University of Hawaii, for instance,
                    for the East-West Center auditorium, that we couldn't get into. And I was saying
                    to myself, “Why is it that we, the taxpayers, can't use the facilities that we
                    paid for?” I mean, the university should come to us; we shouldn't go to
                    them.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>Well, it turns out what happened was the checks from the Treasury were going to
                    the University of Hawaii, and they were not being used solely for the East-West
                    Center. And so John and I decided to do something about this thing. So we went
                    to the governor of Hawaii.</p>
                <p>Now, the governor of Hawaii in those days - and maybe it is now - but I mean,
                    that's a real powerful position. And the man was a nice guy. And then we bring
                    it up to the State Department. Jim Baker said, “My god, you've been to the State
                    Department before?” You know, it was surprising to him.</p>
                <p>So we went after this thing, to get the checks going to the East-West Center, and
                    the East-West Center would spend the money. It's East-West Center's money, you
                    know.</p>
                <p>And anyway, to make a long story short, we did, but what we did was we - and I
                    knew we were doing it - we worked ourselves out of an awfully nice situation.
                    Well, they didn't need us anymore. So they disbanded the board - not the
                    East-West Center. John stayed; and John should stay because he was kind of the
                    author of it, and he was far more important than I was, as far as I was
                    concerned.</p>
                <p>But I've often been proud of that, and I'll show you the letter thaHenry
                    Kissinger wrote me. It's still in my office.</p>
                <p>Q: Why did they disband the board?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, the board wasn't needed if they were getting the funds, and it was
                    coming in, and then they could go on. One of the big things of the board was the
                    constant fight over money and things like that, and it wasn't needed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the purpose of the board?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: It had representation from a lot of the people that were leaders in
                    Hawaii, and also around the country. And it was a very prestigious thing to be
                    on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, a Center is expected to have a board.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. Well, maybe they've got a board, but they didn't need this board. But
                    John stayed, and I told him he should stay - for a while; he's not still there.
                    But that I've always been proud of the fact we're one of the few people that
                    ever knowingly worked on something to get out of a government job. You know,
                    usually you get a little bit more power. We did it the other way, and said,
                    “No.”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's usually self-perpetuating.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, it's self-perpetuating. But we said, “No, this iwrong.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you heard from Kissinger?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, I got a letter from Kissinger. I've got it framed ithe office, and
                    I'll show it to you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was reacting to that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, he was reacting thanking me for just the time I'd spenon the board.
                    He was Secretary of State at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you first got there, what did you find was going on
                        with thboard in Hawaii, in terms of issues the board was dealing with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, gosh, I can't remember what they were. A lot of it was the
                    application, how was this thing being handled. The frustration of, “What do you
                    mean we can't afford this and that,” sort of thing. “Well, we couldn't get the
                    money for this and that.” And that started a lot of it.</p>
                <p>And you wanted to be sure you got students from all over the Far East - because,
                    after all, the idea - and we had students not only from the Far East, but we had
                    students from this country, too - but the idea was that, and basically it's a
                    good idea, is that the young people who are the leaders in China, Japan, or you
                    name it, would go to the East-West Center for their education, and when they
                    went back, they hopefully felt they understood how America worked. That was what
                    the idea was. And it's a lovely place, and it worked well. And I think some of
                    the people that are probably leaders now have had that experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You used the term a little while ago you had a sort of
                        quasi-public life.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. (End of tape)</p>
                <p>-but I want to be able to afford it, and I didn't want to run fopublic
                    office.</p>
                <p>Glenn Jackson at one time did ask me, when I was in my forties and everybody knew
                    I was going to stay sober - he asked me if I'd like to take a shot at running
                    for governor someday. And I said no, I didn't want to. I said, “I don't want to
                    be a public servant.”</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>I didn't feel that there was, frankly, enough money in it for me. I wanted to be
                    - I don't like to use the word “rich,” but I wanted to be financially
                    independent. I'd seen what it means to be financially independent. I think I
                    made the right choice - for me. I mean, other people, no, but for me, yes, it's
                    very, very important. I suppose you can find it in my background. We've covered
                    that enough.</p>
                <p>But I did want to serve something that was interesting. And then of course when
                    the Port chance came - there was a lot of drama at that time, you know, because
                    the people had voted that the Commission of Public Docks become part of the Port
                    of Portland, so they had a new Commission, and then four and four - you can
                    count them - and there was one other guy, that was me, that Tom appointed. He
                    appointed all of them, but I was the new boy in town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were alert to the Port politics because of the
                        merger...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. I remember supporting it and working for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have not managed to really understand very well what
                        thdifficulties were in getting that going.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Jealousies. Turf, that sort of thing. The same old stufthere always is in
                    politics.</p>
                <p>The Commission of Public Docks - you see, the thing you don't realize is we don't
                    have - we are a port city, but we're up a river. Seattle is the big competition.
                    You come right in, you don't need a pilot to get you over the bar from the ocean
                    to Astoria, then from Astoria you take another pilot to Portland. You don't need
                    that expense; you just go in with one pilot in Seattle and it is much faster.
                    They have a lot of things going for them in the Sound. The Sound is a marvelous
                    thing. The Sound made Seattle, just like the port made New York. You look at
                    some of port these cities, Long Beach, Oakland, et al.</p>
                <p>And I remember in the old days, apparently, the port was very popular because it
                    was fresh water, and the barnacles would fall off the sailing ships. Well, that
                    no longer applies.</p>
                <p>And people would say, “Well, we should go to Astoria and work with Astoria.”
                    We've certainly explored the idea of working with Astoria, but there's a big
                    problem with working with Astoria: How do you get the goods from Astoria in?
                    We've got one small railroad. Now, you could put other railroads in there, but
                    the environmentalists and everything else, it would be very difficult to do
                    that, and very, very, very expensive.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>So it's better to have what you've got here in Portland because we're the hub -
                    that's one thing we've got that Seattle doesn't have, we are the hub of the
                    railroads right here. Seattle does not function that way.</p>
                <p>And the port, we were way behind Oakland, for example, which was the first port
                    on the Pacific Coast to put in container facilities and things like that. I
                    remember when we had to make that choice, a brand new facility we called Fulton
                    Terminal for John Fulton, who was President of the Port and died in office.</p>
                <p>But what people don't realize about the Port of Portland is it includes the
                    airport, which is a huge, profitable machine. Right now it's going through some
                    things, but it's going to be, with Delta's participation, just wonderful.</p>
                <p>And then the property which they own, which they've been very smart, I think,
                    about leasing property that's on water, long-term leases, but don't sell it to
                    them. It's a finite resource.</p>
                <p>But the Port of Portland got to be very large. I remember we had one woman who
                    would come to the meetings and would just pester us, and she thought we were
                    getting big heads and things like that, and she wanted to be sure we kept it
                    down.</p>
                <p>I was out on a boat with her in the Willamette River, touring, and she said - and
                    I was President at the time, and she said, “Well, how do you like your - all
                    your properties and everything?” I said, “Well, how do you like all your
                    properties?” That shut her up. I said, “They aren't mine.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I can't remember her name; I'm sorry. I'd like to have hename because she
                    was a pain in the ass.</p>
                <p>But anyway, I remember one time in the Port of Portland - the art community -
                    Wendy Wells Jackson - she is Bill Wells' and Mitzie Wells' daughter - but she
                    came to me and she says, “You know, they're going to take down the painting
                    that's covering the center of the Terminal wall .” And you can still see it
                    there, above the restaurants - it's a modern painting that's up there. And she
                    said, “We're going to protest it.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Well, let me look into it.” Anyway, it came down to a vote, and the
                    vote was close, and I voted to retain the painting. And Wendy came up to me, and
                    all the artists and everyone - a bunch of liberal Democrats, you know - I mean,
                    not even a vote for my candidates anywhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Art-loving Democrats.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Art-loving Democrats. They were all hugging me and everything, and I was
                    getting some bad looks from some of these guys that voted the other way. And I
                    said, “Wendy, I haven't changed. I want to be honest with you. I looked into
                    this thing, and the reason I left it up there, and I don't think it's very
                    pretty, but the reason I left it up there is it would cost $40,000 to take it
                    down, and I think it's better up there.” I shouldn't have told Wendy that; I
                    should have let her just go and think that I finally had seen the light.</p>
                <p>And you can still see it. I see it when I go out there. I look foit every once in
                    a while and kind of laugh to myself. I always chuckle.</p>
                <p>But that was a great experience. Lloyd Anderson the new Port Executive Director
                    was a very good - he was different from Ed. He was a quieter man. He stayed
                    there - he worked under Ed for a year, so he watched - that was a smart
                    turnover, as you knew Westerdahl would do it that way. And I hated to see Ed
                    leave. But of course I'd known Lloyd from city government.</p>
                <p>I remember once with Tom Benson, we had a road behind Tom Benson which had a lot
                    of potholes in it, and Lloyd was in charge of roads. And you know, the potholes
                    were deep. The glass would break sometimes, in the trucks, that's how they'd get
                    into the warehouse. And I couldn't get the city to do much, and so I said, “The
                    hell with it,” and so I called up a guy I knew, and he went up and he
                    blacktopped it. I didn't say anything, just paid for it.</p>
                <p>And finally Lloyd called me to tell me that everything was ready, they were going
                    to come over and blacktop it. I said, “You don't have to. I've already done
                    it.”</p>
                <p>He said, “You blacktopped a city street?!”</p>
                <p>I said, “Yes, and it didn't cost you a dime.”</p>
                <p>He always liked that. And you know, I'll tell you, I do get along with the
                    liberals better than you might think. Pauline Anderson, his wife, was - boy,
                    she's something else. She's a liberal, you know, if you're going to use the
                    word, I suppose. But I just adore her. And we've had a lot of fun together and
                    teased each other a great deal, - if you can kind of tease somebody with some of
                    this stuff, if you don't get mad.</p>
                <p>Pauline really - I'm jumping ahead a little bit, but I think it ought to be
                    mentioned here, perhaps, and we can bring it in later if you want, but I'll
                    forget if I don't do it. When I was to go for Senate confirmation on the - I've
                    been confirmed by the Senate twice, one the FMC and one Romania - on the
                    Romanian one, there was a rumor out that I was a member of a club in Portland,
                    Oregon that did not allow females. Well, it had nothing to do with me being
                    ambassador. It was the Arlington Club.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>Well, I had voted - we had a vote in the membership - I voted for women
                    membership. And anyway, I got word of it before, and so I called up Bob Hedges,
                    the manager of Arlington Club, to find out, “Who do I talk to on this thing?”
                    And it was Pauline was one of the people.</p>
                <p>So I called her, and I said, “You know how I feel about these things. You and I
                    have disagreed on a couple of things, but I don't feel this way at all.”</p>
                <p>And she said, “I know you don't.” And she said, “When is thhearing?”</p>
                <p>I said, “I think it's the day after tomorrow.”</p>
                <p>She Fed-Ex'd me a beautiful letter. And I let it be known that I had the letter.
                    I said, “If you want to bring it up, fine, I'll read it. I'd like to read
                    it.”</p>
                <p>Same thing with people of the Jewish faith at Smoke Tree Ranch. Well, there was a
                    Jew in the Smoke Tree, fortunately. I mean, he was a wonderful guy. The senate
                    didn't know he was in residence, so I got his permission to use his name if the
                    matter came up. And I let it be known I had this information.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The politics of confirmation, that can be a subject.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, that would be a good subject.</p>
                <p>I thought Lloyd was a good leader. They changed everything when the
                    Administration changed - the reason I was President and then off was because Bob
                    Straub came in after McCall, and he was a Democrat, so he put his people on.</p>
                <p>But they asked all of us to stay on for an extra six months because we knew the
                    intricacies of getting the drydock floated over the Pacific Ocean to the Port of
                    Portland. We were involved in that, and they didn't have time to bring everybody
                    up to speed on it. So I said, “Sure, if it will help, I'll say on.”</p>
                <p>So we did. We got the drydock all there, and there's a little plaquin there
                    saying who the Commissioners were at that time.</p>
                <p>Then we went off the Commission. Then I was Vic's chairman and ran his campaign,
                    and we whipped Straub good. And Straub was a good governor, incidentally. I like
                    Bob Straub. He's the right kind of guy. But Vic Atiyeh is a better guy, and Vic
                    Atiyeh is a friend of mine.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>But anyway, so Vic asked me, he said, “Is there anything you want?” And I said,
                    “Well, I really enjoyed that Port.” And he said, “Okay.” So that's how that
                    happened.</p>
                <p>And then Bob Packwood was looking for somebody to be chairman of the Federal
                    Maritime Commission. And they said, “Why don't you get an Oregonian?”</p>
                <p>And he said, “Well, that's a hell of a good idea. Who would I get?”</p>
                <p>“Why don't you get Punch Green? He's almost retired, and he's had lot of
                    experience with the Port.”</p>
                <p>So they called me up. First you go through being a Commissioner,then Chairman,
                    and I said, “Only if I'm Chairman.”</p>
                <p>And they said, “Yes, that's assured. That's a promise.” So I said,“Okay.”</p>
                <p>There was another guy that wanted the chairman badly off the Commission - and he
                    kept sending me down - Tom Benson Glass Company - he kept sending me huge
                    packages of reading material that I'd have to go through, see. He was trying to
                    discourage me from doing this thing. I just junked it; didn't pay any attention
                    to any of it. I have my theory on that, but - give me about a page and a half of
                    redline stuff, and then we'll start to do some business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me, how did you have the nerve to ask to be
                        chairman?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I didn't have the nerve - oh, well, they kind of brought iup, really, just
                    as much as I did.</p>
                <p>You see, the Republicans controlled the Senate at that time. It was a two-year
                    span or a four-year span where they controlled - they didn't have the House, but
                    they had the Senate. So it's a Senate confirmation deal.</p>
                <p>And they wanted me as chairman, too. They didn't want me - I mean, the
                    Commissioner job is - well, you do what the chairman tells you to do - I mean,
                    you'd better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's going to be a great subject to get into.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>It's the 11th of May, 1999.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>Before we get to the Port history, just a couple of pick-up points. I wondered if
                    there was more to say about Mabel Bishop. Any details that characterize Mabel,
                    some anecdotes?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I'll tell you Mabel went on and married Mort Bishop.I've gone
                    through the secretarial thing, as being my first secretary?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. And she really went on to tremendous success. She married a wonderful
                    man, Mort Bishop, who is head of Pendleton Woolen Mills here now, and they are
                    very happily married. Mabel and I are about the same age; she wouldn't mind my
                    saying it, she's 74. But she went on to become the leader - the Regent - of
                    Mount Vernon in Washington, DC. As a matter of fact, in 1999 you'll see a float
                    for Mount Vernon, in the Rose Festival Parade, of which some of those roses
                    belong to me. I always support her.</p>
                <p>But I'll tell you a funny story. In the den in Romania, in my residence in
                    Bucharest, there was a picture of Mabel walking with the Queen of England at
                    Mount Vernon. People would ask me, “Who is that?” and I would say, “Well, that's
                    Mabel Bishop. I don't know who the other lady is.” But she looked very royal. I
                    was very proud of her.</p>
                <p>That's about what I wanted to say about her. She's a wonderfuperson and a success
                    few in Oregon appreciate.</p>
                <p>Q: In talking about the Comprehensive Care, that whole history, you had mentioned
                    working with Larry Hayden, and you talked about some differences. I wonder if
                    there is a way of getting into the differences that you had.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, we simply had a difference in philosophy. Larry was an actor, and he
                    was - and I guess I am, too. But I don't think I'm a prima donna, and Larry was
                    a prima donna. He wasn't used to having anybody step in his way and criticize
                    him and say, “No, we're not going to do it this way.” And that's where that
                    awful unanimity rule came in where I could do it. It was working for me.</p>
                <p>But anyway, we ended up filling up the place and making it extremely profitable,
                    if I can be so crass as to use that word with that sort of thing, but it was, it
                    was extremely profitable.</p>
                <p>But he wouldn't admit to any of that. I remember once Larry got very uptight with
                    me when a friend of mine, who shall remain nameless, was upstairs taking
                    treatment, and I heard about it, so I drove out there and went upstairs and saw
                    him. Well, he wanted me to get permission. I said, “Larry, I'm an owner in this
                    place. I can go anywhere I want to go.”</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>But anyway, it was that sort of relationship. Spike Hennessey I have mentioned,
                    and we had to get rid of Hayden - we just had to break it up, or it wouldn't
                    have worked. And so we did. We broke it up to two guys that weren't very good,
                    and their ethics were bad.</p>
                <p>Then Lee Karns came into it and saved it.</p>
                <p>Q: You know, it gets on the threshold of some larger questions, and I think a
                    really interesting question, although it's a very general one, is to ask you to
                    speak to just the lessons in business that you have learned. Here we've talked
                    about personalities. Some things must become pretty clear to you over the years
                    that would be good advice.</p>
                <p>GREEN: I've always felt that business really is a matter of common sense. To my
                    knowledge, I have never cheated. I've always tried to give the customer the
                    best. I'm not afraid to charge the customer if he starts getting so tough on me
                    that so I can't make a profit. I've never thought that - the volume was the
                    answer; I've always thought volume at a decent profit is the answer.</p>
                <p>I've always thought that - and this is something that people forget all the time,
                    particularly small businesses - who are growing is collecting the money for the
                    sale within a reasonable length of time. I would tell my people, I said, “Until
                    that money is in the bank and the check has passed, you don't have a sale.
                    You've just got a liability.”</p>
                <p>And we were very, very good about that sort of thing. They used to call me Greedy
                    Green as just a laughable thing, but I was very serious about this issue -
                    positive cash flow. I think that what you've got to do is you've got to find the
                    right people, and I've been blessed with that, to bring them along with you who
                    are technically good at it. I'm a rainmaker. Did you ever read the book The
                    Rainmaker? I'm the guy that goes out and gets the business, and then I send it
                    in to the company, and the company is the one that completes it - they take it
                    from there. Because I usually have majority control, they have my instructions
                    similar to what I've just said. But I would go out and get it, and I'd have my
                    parameters, I mean, what I thought we could sell it for and that sort of
                    thing.</p>
                <p>But then I always would bring my people that performed, after they'd been with me
                    for a couple, three years, and I liked them and had met their families and all
                    that, and I said to myself, “Well, you know, he or she wants his kids to go to
                    college and retire, the same as everybody else does,” so I'd help them. And they
                    became financially independent, some of these people, I mean on a relative
                    basis, when I sold out because they had a good piece of the action.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>I'll tell you two other things that I don't think you'll hear of other people
                    doing it, but as long as this thing is kind of for posterity, I'm rather proud
                    of my attitude for doing this because I've heard that it's seldom done, and that
                    is when I sold out of Comprehensive Care - well, I still had a few shares left -
                    and I'd made an awful lot of money on this thing, relative to investment - and I
                    collected quite a bit of money while I was there, too, I mean in Director and
                    salary type of things.</p>
                <p>So I called up Don Hering. I was in Washington, DC at the time. Don Hering was
                    with Black &amp; Company. And I said, “How much are you making on this sale?” We
                    sold it over a period of time, i.e. 4 weeks. It was a small stock, but there was
                    strength in the market, so we sold into the strength. And I said, “How much are
                    you making on this deal?” I've seen these enormous sums that they were making
                    back East on deals that I could see - I couldn't participate in because I was in
                    government, but I'd see it. And I said, “How much are you making on this
                    deal?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Don't worry about it.” And I said, “Well, I am worrieabout it. I want
                    to know.”</p>
                <p>And he told me. I said, “Double that.” And it came to about mid-five figures for
                    him. And I said, “It's a tax-deductible item for me, and I want you to have it.
                    You've answered my questions now for 20 years, Mickey Mouse questions. You're
                    the one guy in town that would.” And I said, “I want you to profit from this
                    thing, too.” So he did.</p>
                <p>Bill Bernard was my attorney on the Benson sale, he would answer questions over
                    time - I was out of town at that time, too, and I got a price, and I got
                    everything we wanted, and I told him, I said, “Look it over, but I don't want
                    you to do anything to screw this thing up with a bunch of legalese.” I said, “I
                    want this thing to go through so I get my money in a reasonable length of
                    time.”</p>
                <p>And he did, he had one clause he wanted to put in, and I said, “Well, go ahead
                    and try it, but if it stops it, don't do it.” He called me, and he said, “No,
                    they accepted it.” And I said, “Well, that's good.”</p>
                <p>So anyway, the deal went through, and then his bill came to me. And I looked at
                    it, and again, I'd seen what these DC lawyers were charging. So I called him up,
                    and I said, “Bill, you hear this?” And I tore his bill up on the telephone.</p>
                <p>And I'm not a fool on this stuff; don't get me wrong. But it's deductible as part
                    of the cost of the sale, and it was so minor compared to what the sale was, and
                    I doubled what the bill was. I said, “That's the bill I want.”</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>So that's kind of my philosophy in this stuff. I mean, I'm proud of it. And
                    sometimes I'll walk around town, and I'll see a couple of people that I know
                    that they're doing very well because I helped them. That's a nice feeling.
                    That's priceless, that sort of feeling. I'm not the second coming, don't get me
                    wrong, but I believe in it. And I don't think you have to be crooked or slick or
                    anything like that to make a great deal of money. I just don't think you do. And
                    I don't think you have to be in one set of businesses, as long as you get people
                    around you you can trust who do know that business. I wouldn't hesitate to go in
                    with a guy on the Internet, and I don't know anything about it, but if I can get
                    the right guy or gal -.</p>
                <p>But right now I just celebrated my 74th birthday, so I'm kind of jussliding
                    around now, having fun.</p>
                <p>Q: Why do you do this, this generosity, it would be called?</p>
                <p>GREEN: I don't know. I guess it's generosity. I genuinely like good, effective
                    people. They have done a lot of what I call Mickey Mouse things for me in the
                    past and never really charged for them, and it's kind of a payback for all that
                    small stuff.</p>
                <p>I think I mentioned to you Moe Tonkon in the Western Battery thing, did the same
                    thing. I sent him a check every once in a while; he couldn't figure out what it
                    was for. I said, “It's not for anything. It's just because I know you're
                    there.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How common is it to work that way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: They tell me it's seldom been done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's just not common.</hi>

                <p>GREEN: No. I don't think it is common, and I can understand. And I don't want to
                    start a trend, but -. Bill Bernard I've known all my life. Don Hering is a very
                    good friend of mine, and the whole Hering clan are good friends of mine. But I
                    mean, you know, Don's always been kind of the loner of the whole group, but he
                    was just terrific with me the whole Comp. Care time. He'd hold my hand during
                    tough times with Comprehensive Care - there were a lot of periods when I didn't
                    know whether the company was going to make it or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kinds of dishonesty do you encounter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I'll tell you one thing we had. Let's see how I caput this thing -
                    because I don't want somebody to get in trouble.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, we don't want to do that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: We had a hardware situation. We just started hardware down at Benson,
                    split it off a little bit. We had a new guy there, and I found out a couple or
                    three weeks later that we were low on a job. I said, “Geez, that's great.”</p>
                <p>And then I found out on another job that somebody else had the job, and he told
                    me before the opening of the bids. I said, “How -?” He said, “Well, we've got a
                    little knowledge.” I said, “No, we're not going to do that sort of thing here. I
                    just won't have it.” He said, “Well, you won't get any business,” and I said,
                    “That's right. I won't go to jail, either.” I said, “Just find yourself another
                    spot.”</p>
                <p>That's the sort of thing you can get into if you want to. I mean, it's easy.
                    There are a lot of temptations out there. But gosh, I can't emphasize - not the
                    straight and narrow, don't think that I haven't over-emphasized the product and
                    a few things; I mean, you know, I'm a salesman. But it's not cheating. I think
                    there's a great deal of difference between some of these things you read about
                    and a guy just out there trying to convince you that his product's better than
                    the next guy. And you know, a lot of it has to do with enthusiasm, and a lot of
                    it has to do with acquaintanceship, but a lot of it's trust. If you trust
                    somebody, you're going to buy from them. And you're not going to let a dollar's
                    price difference or something - it might be mentioned to you, but you say, “I
                    can't beat it.” I always tell them the truth. I say, “I can charge you that, but
                    I won't make any money on it, and I'll have to give it up.” And they'd usually
                    stay. Some would leave because of that.</p>
                <p>I know in the battery company we got rid of every account we had, with the
                    exception of one fellow down in Warrenton, Oregon. Wilt Paulson was his name, a
                    wonderful guy. I don't know if Wilt's still alive or not. But anyway, Bill
                    Kennedy was my genius there. God, he was a good man - is a good man. And he
                    said, “We don't have any business anymore.” I said, “No, we don't, but we're not
                    losing business.”</p>
                <p>We had Bill, we had myself, which I wasn't - I was on the payroll but not drawing
                    any money, and then two guys out in the shop. We ended up we were going 24 hours
                    a day, new plant and everything else. Sold it to Chloride in London, England,
                    biggest replacement battery manufacturer in the world in mid-'70s.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>But you know, it all takes time. It's not a unique philosophy. I don't believe
                    you have to go to business school to learn these things. I think if a person's
                    going to business school, a person ought to first go out in the world and see
                    what's going on, work in the summers, find out what really happens. I mean, it's
                    all common sense. You have to have people around you that know the product, know
                    the technicalities, but you're down to the common sense of delivering the
                    product on time, a good product, the best one you can give, charge enough so you
                    can make a profit - a reasonable profit, not gouging. I'm talking about a
                    reasonable profit. Tell them what the profit is.</p>
                <p>And work with the unionAt Western Batteries, it would have been deadly if we'd
                    had a strike. So Bill Kennedy got to know this guy pretty well, the union
                    representative. And the men were happy. They were getting overtime coming out of
                    their yingyang, and Bill would say, “Here, your contract's coming up, let's take
                    a look at the books.” We'd show them the books. We'd say, “Yes, we can afford
                    this much, but we can't afford to go any higher because then I'd have to raise
                    the price and the overtime goes out and we can't do it.” And he was reasonable.
                    We never had a strike.</p>
                <p>And then the one thing, and I'm repeating it, is collect the amount of money in a
                    reasonable length of time. I don't care if you're Microsoft. It doesn't make any
                    difference. These basic facts apply to any business. If you're selling hotdogs
                    down there, you'd better damn well have the guy sell the hotdog and get the cash
                    for the hotdog because if you don't get the cash for the hotdog you've seen the
                    last of him.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes. Even I have had some experience with that.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, we've all had it. I've had friends - and this is how you lose a friend
                    - I've had friends from high school that knew I was going along pretty well and
                    have come in to see me and needed some money and want to borrow it. So I usually
                    give them $200 or something, and “Okay, I'll pay you back next month.” And you
                    know, I'd see them walking down the street, and they'd see me and cross the
                    street. And I'd say, “Well, I'll never see that again.”</p>
                <p>Had one guy come in, and I said, “No, you can't borrow, but I'll telyou what I
                    will do, I'll give it to you.”</p>
                <p>And that's stopped now, too. I haven't done that in a long time.</p>
                <p>Anything else on that?</p>
                <p>Q: Well, the labor thing is going to come up again when we get into the Port
                    history, and that will certainly be an interesting return to the subject.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those were the things that I'd thought of picking up in
                        advance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>In general, what is the state of the culture or the atmosphere in business in the
                    Portland area, with regard to this trust and the attitude toward honesty
                    and...</p>
                <p>GREEN: I think Portland's pretty good. We're not a small towanymore. It's getting
                    very sophisticated, as you can see.</p>
                <p>Of course, communication is everything. What's going on in Bucharest, I know
                    exactly what's going on in Bucharest right now if I want to, and so do you.
                    Everything has changed. I mean, I met a person, played golf with him this
                    weekend, who does feature film type of things, lives in Oregon and doesn't
                    leave, doesn't have to. But I mean it's amazing, with this new computer concept
                    that's going on now, you live where you want to live.</p>
                <p>So I found underneath it all - there were some rascals, sure, but you knew them.
                    You knew who they were. I mean, when we'd bid a job, in the glass business for
                    example, we knew the guys that pedaled our figures, and we'd give them a figure
                    that's a lot higher than the one we were giving their competition. I don't think
                    I'm talking out of turn now. I don't want to mention names, either. Sometimes, a
                    couple times we got the job at the higher figure, too. The guy was low with
                    other stuff, and we got it. So I didn't say anything about that. I don't think
                    that's being dishonest. I think that's being lucky.</p>
                <p>Q: The period that we're getting into with the Port is 1970, and a setting for
                    all of this is the Nixon Administration, which is headed for a fall, it's headed
                    for a resolution of the Vietnam thing and opening of China and so forth, but
                    also the fall. And I wonder if you can get back in your thinking to what you
                    were going through in your mind as you saw Nixon's administration go through
                    these experiences?</p>
                <p>GREEN: And of course that was all televised, too.</p>
                <p>I was distraught, as I would imagine people who voted for Clinton have been
                    distraught. I know this sounds terribly partisan, and I try not to be, and I
                    think I really probably have moderated a lot since I've been back from Romania,
                    or maybe my age has something to do with it, but I really don't know what
                    Richard Nixon did that was so bad. He made tapes. They had a break-in; he lied
                    about the break-in. But there was a hatred of Nixon in this country that was
                    unbelievable.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>What he'll be remembered for is opening China. But I just don't know what
                    Watergate - I mean, I remember when I was ambassador occasionally people would
                    say to me, “What about Watergate? This happens here all the time.” You know,
                    break-ins and lying to the people and all that. I said, “Well, that's the
                    strength of our country. I mean, the system works.”</p>
                <p>You know, we almost had Mark Hatfield as President. We should have.I think I
                    covered that.</p>
                <p>But I don't know, Jim. I have never been that uptight. I was mad it was going on,
                    but I have to in all honesty say that I was far more partisan at that time. Now
                    the Republican Party has succeeded in turning me off in a lot of things. If
                    they'll take the abortion plank out of their platform, I'll come back a lot
                    quicker, and a lot of us feel that way. I mean, I don't like the far right in
                    the Republican Party, and they're controlling a lot of it. I like to win general
                    elections.</p>
                <p>But at that time we didn't have that, and I was far more partisathan I feel I am
                    as we speak in 1999 on May the 11th.</p>
                <p>But it was too bad. That's one of the times I met George Bush. He was chairman of
                    the Republican Party right at the worst time he could be, he took it on purpose.
                    And he came to town and seven of us met with him. The future President of the
                    United States. But you didn't, of course, know at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was party chairman during Watergate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: During Watergate. Kind of snuck into town and snuck out. There wasn't
                    exactly a parade down Broadway for him. I think there was only about seven of us
                    that met. I don't know where we met. I think at a hotel; we never try to meet at
                    a club because they might find out about it, the newspapers find out about it,
                    and it doesn't look as good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the purpose of his visit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, just to see the organization. He was going around and seeing all the
                    states. It wasn't any great thing. I don't think he hardly even remembers it. He
                    doesn't even remember I was there; I know that. I've asked him. It's kind of all
                    one blur, you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You saw the right come on in the party.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, I sure did.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You saw it locally and also nationally. When did that
                        happen anwhat were you seeing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, it was gradual. They won't give in on one point that they believe
                    in, which in a way should be admirable, I suppose, but life doesn't work that
                    way. And so - I mean, as we say, Walter Huss was kind of a joke. But he had his
                    people. And Barry Goldwater is when it all kind of started, near as I could see.
                    And then it just got stronger and stronger. We got weaker.</p>
                <p>Our trouble that we have is that we may go to church - I don't particularly go to
                    church, but they all go to church, their own church, and that's their choice,
                    and then they go downstairs in the church and put out the propaganda, and we go
                    out and play golf.</p>
                <p>You know, when Lon Mabon ran against Gordon Smith, he only got about 2000 votes,
                    I think. And you laugh at it, but then you think, that's 2000 dedicated people,
                    in a state the size of Oregon, and they're mainly in Southern Oregon counties, I
                    think. And you say, “Boy, they can do a lot if they're willing to do it that
                    way.” And we aren't. I've often thought we ought to get a fund up to hire some
                    people to do it. But I haven't done that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill Moshofsky's always tried to counteract it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. Bill Moshofsky's been trying. You know, it'frustrating.</p>
                <p>I kind of think the far right's leaving it. It's moving out now of the party.
                    They're always there. They're putting on a reasonable face, or trying to, until
                    you get to their basic stuff. But I think they're kind of being overcome by
                    people who believe as I do, moderate belief. I mean, we're just not that strong
                    about that subject. It's something that should be a part of their own personal
                    beliefs, but not part of politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you know Don Hodel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, very well.</p>
                <p>Q: Now, Don Hodel has made a progression from perhaps more moderate Republicanism
                    to being very closely identified with the far right. Do you know the story of
                    how that happened?</p>
                <p>GREEN: No, I don't. I knew him as a cabinet officer, and I knew him when he was
                    at Bonneville and all that. And I've read in the paper - well, it happens, you
                    know. I mean, Walter Dickenson's a good friend of mine. Dickenson's jellies. All
                    of that went down to some Christian radio network in Texas. I mean, it
                    happens.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>But the majority, I'm talking about, is far more reasonable about it. I mean, you
                    can't find a more religious man, I suppose, than Mark Hatfield, but nobody can
                    fairly say he's unreasonable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the '70s, were you seeing Reagan as part of this

                    speech in the Goldwater campaign, in defense of Goldwater. That's what really
                    brought him to national attention.</p>
                <p>My problem was I was looking at the people surrounding Reagan in Oregon, and
                    politics for me is a - I might be jumping ahead a little bit, but it's true -
                    politics for me is a hobby, and I want to enjoy the people I'm working with.
                    Otherwise, I'd just as soon skip it. So I didn't particularly like the people
                    supporting Reagan, the strong political belief people supporting Reagan in
                    Oregon. They made me uncomfortable. There were a couple of guys I played golf
                    with and liked very much, Pete Buck being one, he's no longer with us, I could
                    at least talk to him.</p>
                <p>So I just stayed out of it, and that's when Mort Bishop called me up and said to
                    me, “I don't see your name on it,” and I said, “No, you're not going to. Forget
                    it.” And he said, “Well, I've got a guy I think you want to meet.” And he and
                    Broughton Bishop, his brother, we had lunch with George Bush, and that was kind
                    of love at first sight for me. The Bishops went to school with George Bush.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, really? So you were seeing George Bush as an
                        alternative.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. I saw him as an alternative, and I also liked the people surrounding
                    George Bush around here, see. I was Bush's chairman in 19 - when was it? - it
                    was '80. I was George Bush's chairman in '80, and then of course we got about
                    six delegates to the convention, and then they asked me to be co-chairman of the
                    Reagan-Bush Oregon effort, and I said I would, for the general election.</p>
                <p>And I did that, and that's what kind of made me - never part of the top Reagan
                    group, they wouldn't allow me in there. But anyway, that's kind of what led to
                    my acceptance as far as they were concerned to be chairman of the Federal
                    Maritime Commission.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the group, the Reagan group earlier?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, it was Pete Buck, as I mentioned. And I'm trying to think - I mean,
                    I didn't know a lot of them. I can't tell you. I really don't know. Walter Huss
                    type of people, too, they were all very excited about him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you could see a religious right cast to this
                        group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Reagan himself was marvelous. He was marvelous. I mean,
                    he was funny, and he himself was an extremely charming man. I don't know why he
                    didn't quite understand what he was doing to the party. I don't think he cared
                    much. He might not have voiced it, but - certainly he had to see it. Because I
                    got to know his cabinet officers in Washington, and they were great - most of
                    them were great. Didn't like Donald Regan much, but that was all right; he
                    didn't like me, either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that it was a pretty high-level strategy to
                        involve threligious right, to infuse their fervor into the campaign.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, sure. It's a bloc vote, a huge bloc vote, a lot of them in the
                    South, where the South used to be solid Democrats. So they're all very, very,
                    very conservative in a religious conservative way. So yes, that was exactly
                    right, but when the champion leaves the ring, you know, what are you going to
                    do? He can control it, but George Bush I thought was a wonderful President.
                    George Bush had the President of the senate George Mitchell, a Democrat,
                    opposing him as head of the Senate, and he blocked President Bush every chance
                    he could get.</p>
                <p>I'm awful proud to have my name involved with Bush, I'll tell yothat.</p>
                <p>Q: One other thing about the period is the economic background. We were going
                    through a period of economic crisis with the energy crisis and OPEC and so
                    forth, and I think we have to have an account of how that affected things and
                    what you were experiencing as we went through that period of price rise,
                    inflation and finally recession and so forth.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I think it applies to all of us my age at that time. We were of
                    course older, and we were in business, and it depends on how we ran the
                    business, and it depends on the business - some businesses, of course, prosper
                    in times that you've just described.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>I mean, batteries, they've got to have batteries. You know. Wind storms, you've
                    got to replace windows. But we also experienced hard times, but we knew how to
                    handle it, even if we were young, but we still knew how to handle it. We hadn't
                    forgotten it. We'd been through a war. We hadn't forgotten any of that stuff. I
                    think a lot of us when we hit college were a lot more mature than the people
                    that came into college without going through the war. It's just a maturing
                    thing. You don't think about it at the time, but I think in thinking back, I
                    mean, I think this Oral History session, I'm just awful glad I did this because
                    it's like - I've never been to a psychiatrist, but you're like a psychiatrist,
                    Jim, you're bringing things out of me that I hadn't thought about for a long
                    time.</p>
                <p>Sure, there was a recession, I guess, but it was short-lived, and I always played
                    it conservatively, anyway, so I didn't feel it - and my wife had some money, and
                    we invested her stuff very, very conservatively, so I didn't have the terror of
                    losing a job; I owned the company. I had the terror of losing the company,
                    though, I can tell you that. I mean, it came very close to losing the company in
                    the glass company. One of the best things that ever happened to us was that
                    Columbus Day storm. [laughs] God, it was everywhere!</p>
                <p>I remember a reporter called me up. Everybody was saying it was just terrible and
                    things like that, you know, and the hospitals have to be first and everything
                    else. And the guy calls me up, and I said, “Gee, I think it's wonderful.” And
                    then I thought, “Oh, God.” I got quoted, and I must have looked like a terrible
                    person. [laughs]</p>
                <p>But I'll tell you, going back to my philosophy, it was tough because we had to
                    get out there, and we had to put the glass in the hospitals and put the glass in
                    the buildings and the hotels and things like that. But it was all insured. We
                    were the last to be paid and the first to be called. And you know, it was just
                    everywhere. It was good, but I mean, I was paying interest, and I - I finally
                    started calling these people up, and they'd say, “Well, we've got to get the
                    garden fixed, and then the insurance will pay.” But we worked through it.</p>
                <p>Q: In the economic crisis there was also the environmental crisis that was felt
                    at the time, especially by some people who were part of the environmental
                    movement. The energy crisis had a lot of talk about we're going to run out of
                    oil, and it was a very alarmist period. Did you go through an alarm in that
                    period? I'm thinking of not just that, but also the inflation.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>Well, the inflation, I was chairman of the FMC. I remember going down to the
                    Hay-Adams Hotel for lunch and looking across the street, and the AFL-CIO's
                    building there, and they've got a big sign up saying what the inflation is
                    today. It was terrible - I mean, for us. For some countries it's great, but
                    we're not Albania.But that got calmed. You have to go through that. Was I
                    worried? Sure, I was worried, but it's a funny thing about being worried about
                    these things: My philosophy is I'll worry - if it's a problem and everybody's
                    got the same problem, I'll worry with them about it, but I don't want to be the
                    only guy selling apples on the street; I want everybody else selling apples with
                    me. In other words, you can deal together with these crises. Inflation affects
                    all of us, unemployment wages and things like that. But if you're the only one
                    that's having a problem, then it's a real lonely problem, and that's the one
                    you've got to solve and I don't want anymore.</p>
                <p>Of course, I was pretty secure by the time I went back tWashington. I mean, I'd
                    gotten myself in a pretty secure position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you didn't have money in S&amp;Ls...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, I didn't have money in S&amp;Ls.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...which is one of the areas where people were getting
                        hurt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, they were being hurt. And you're always sorry when you read about
                    those things, but unless it's happening to you - if you're going to go into a
                    crying spell on every bad thing that's happened to everybody, you're going to be
                    constantly crying. I mean, pick up the paper this morning - what there is left
                    of it. It's a column short now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I just remember people hoarding gas and...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, we all topped off. Yes, we topped off. You didn't need gas, and you'd
                    go by a station and you'd see no cars - there were a lot more gas stations then,
                    too, than there are now - and you'd see nobody at the pumps, so I remember I'd
                    have three-quarters of a tank, and I'd pop in and get it topped off. We all did
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nixon actually tried some price controls.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, that's right. He tried price controls, and then when they came off it
                    was a disaster, just a disaster. You should never try a price control with a
                    free market economy. It's not there.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Amazing that a Republican would do price controls.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Desperate. Just desperate. Lousy advice. The trouble is you're sitting
                    there, and you're the one that's got to make the decision. Nobody else in the
                    world can make that decision. And you've got guys hammering at you that you
                    admire, you picked. Brilliant people, and they can make cases. And so it's
                    tough.</p>
                <p>But Nixon got out of them. Nixon had guts. Whether you like him or you don't like
                    him, he had an awful lot of courage. Boy, I think Pat Nixon's the one that I
                    admire. I mean, what she must have gone through is just awful. Just awful. And I
                    think their children, his two daughters, I've often thought about that, I mean,
                    my having three daughters, they were right there for their dad. And that's good.
                    That shows something.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, this is background for the Port. So let's go back to 1970 and getting
                    into your experience at the Port. I'm wondering when you started becoming
                    conscious of the Port. But in addition to that, the larger subject of what was
                    going on when you went in, the circumstances. And if you could help us
                    understand better what the problem was between the Portland Dock Commission and
                    the Port as they tried to meld the two.</p>
                <p>GREEN: It was voted on finally.</p>
                <p>Q: It was voted on. There were two measures, and both were withdrawn at the last
                    minute?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, they might have been, but it ended up being voted on, didn't it, in
                    1970?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. The Port wanted...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: To take over.</p>
                <p>Q: The Port of Portland wanted it to be done administratively, and the Portland
                    Dock Commission wanted it to be done by a vote of the City Council and the
                    legislature.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I think the basic problem was money. Port of Portland had some
                    money, and the Commission of Public Docks didn't have any money, to speak
                    of.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>So they voted on it - at least as I recall they voted on it. I wasn't on the
                    thing. Dennis Lindsay - this is what I was doing when you came in because I got
                    thinking about Dennis Lindsay last night, and Dennis, a wonderful guy, a very
                    strong Democrat but a wonderful guy, and he's on vacation right now, but he was
                    on the Port Commission from 1957 to 1969 - can you believe that?</p>
                <p>I remember walking into a building where they were first located when I was first
                    mentioned for the Port, and I wanted to look at it a little bit, and there was
                    the building. It was the Lindsay Building, and I said, “Boy, that's power.”
                    Well, it wasn't named for Dennis.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, I keep running into this, particularly doing this exercise with
                    you, my great-grandfather, W.S. Ladd, was the first President of the Port of
                    Portland. And they have pictures of all the past presidents, and I looked, and
                    there he is. So I was very pleased when I became president. I mean, very few
                    people knew it, but I knew it, and it meant something to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have you talked to Lindsay recently?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I talk to him occasionally. I tried to reach him thimorning, but
                    he's in Europe on vacation.</p>
                <p>There was animosity, and there was turf and things like that. And Ed Westerdahl
                    was the first executive, president. I had always admired people on the Port of
                    Portland, ever since I started being active here, I'd see it, and I said to
                    myself, “If I could ever get on the Port of Portland, I'd really be happy.”
                    Because it dealt with such a vast thing. It's the airports and the land
                    development. You can see how terrific this thing is.</p>
                <p>We have a problem in Portland in the fact that we're a river port, and I think
                    it's a problem. Most of the big ports of the world are river ports, but when
                    you're dealing with competitors like Oakland, where they come right in, with
                    Seattle, Puget Sound, they come right in. San Diego or Long Beach, they come
                    right in. They don't have to go over a bar up and then up a river.</p>
                <p>So the answer to a successful port, and we came up with it, river port, is
                    specialization, and that's what we did with automobiles and things of that sort,
                    importing automobiles. You go down there - at least you used to go down there
                    and there were just thousands and thousands of Toyotas and other makes.</p>
                <p>And then, of course, one other thing that Portland has that Seattle doesn't have,
                    and that's our principal advantage, is we're perfect for railroads. They all
                    come in here, and they spread out throughout the nation through here. So that
                    works to our advantage, of course.</p>

                <p>But we were the last - the container ports, we were one of the last to do that,
                    put containers in. Oakland was just way, way, way far ahead of us. Seattle was
                    ahead of us. Everybody was ahead of us.We had a lot of catching up to do, but we
                    did. When you've got a guy like Westerdahl - I'll tell you, I think Ed
                    Westerdahl is probably the smartest man I've ever worked with. A lot of people,
                    I guess, didn't like him because he was pretty abrupt. But he and I understood
                    each other perfectly.</p>
                <p>I haven't seen him. I guess he's around, but I don't see him much. You know,
                    that's the trouble when you go through stages in life and do different things, I
                    don't think you lose a friend, but you don't see them, you know. Same with Lloyd
                    Anderson, who was excellent. His style was entirely different than Ed
                    Westerdahl's.</p>
                <p>But Ed was there at an awful crucial time. He was needed, and he had the guts to
                    stand up and say “no” to the Commission. “No, we've got to do it this way,” and
                    the logic of it would be there.</p>
                <p>I always made it a point to support him whenever possible, and if I wasn't going
                    to support him, I called him up and told him, I said, “I'm not going to support
                    you on this because - now, go ahead and argue it out with me in private if you
                    want.” And sometimes I'd stay with it, and sometimes I'd swing him over the way
                    I felt about it. But it was amazing.</p>
                <p>I will never forget one instance in the Port. A fellow named Bob Wallace, who was
                    the president of First National Bank at the time, he was on the Port Commission.
                    And we were riding up in the elevator at the Lloyd Building, and I said, “Did
                    you see in the paper where there was about $3 million that if we don't spend it,
                    it's going to go back to the treasury? They're looking for someplace to spend
                    it.” And I always thought, and boy, I learned something on this one, I always
                    thought, well, go back to the Treasury, apply it to the national debt. I know
                    it's not much, $3 million, something like that.</p>
                <p>So anyway, the matter came up for us. And I said - and Bob agreewith me - I said,
                    “We don't need this money.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Bob who?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Bob Wallace. I think he lives in New York now.</p>
                <p>I said, “We don't need this money. This is public money, we don't need it, why
                    don't we send it back to the government so it could be used elsewhere where it's
                    more needed?” Because it was, it was kind of a floater.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>Well, anyway, to make a long story short, I just got pasted. I got pasted by the
                    labor press and everybody. What is the matter with this guy? Take the dollars
                    and use them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It became public?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. Well, it was in a public session.</p>
                <p>And then I thought, “Well, there's one place they will think I'smart: the
                    Arlington Club.”</p>
                <p>I went over to the Arlington Club, and there wasn't anybody speaking to me. They
                    were mad, too. It's a funny thing. So I learned something, you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you learn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I learned that people don't look at it the same way I do. I mean, I
                    hear people voting for light rail; they don't want a light rail, but if we don't
                    spend it here, they're going to spend it in Oklahoma. You know, that sort of
                    logic, which I guess is right. But I've never felt that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It makes some sense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, sure. It makes a lot of sense, as far as that goes, but I still think
                    -. I can remember the FMC, everybody - we had to be sure that we spent all of
                    our budget. Same thing with the State Department, we had to be sure we spent -
                    everybody was broke the whole year until the last month, then we found a little
                    money left over, and we had to spend it. If we didn't spend it, it would be
                    taken away from us the next fiscal. It's crazy. You ought to be rewarded for not
                    spending that money. It's crazy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this Port issue of the approximately $3 million, what
                        was thafor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I don't know what it was for. I think they ended up building a couple
                    tennis courts with it - not the Port, the City - which I think is a fine idea.
                    No, the area didn't lose it.</p>
                <p>Q: There are a number of things to pick up on here. Starting at the top,
                    Westerdahl: Can you illustrate his style with some cases, some instances of
                    dealing with him?</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>GREEN: Well, he's brilliant. He picks up quicker than anybody I've ever known. He
                    just - you know, he'd look at you. He likes the good life. I mean, he was making
                    good money and liked the good life. And he was entitled to it; he had worked
                    very hard.</p>
                <p>There were people that didn't like him because he didn't hesitate to state his
                    beliefs. And of course you have to realize he might have brought a little
                    baggage with him because he and Ron Schmidt had helped guide Tom McCall to a
                    very successful governorship.</p>
                <p>And Tom was the governor, so you couldn't say too much against Ed. The Port
                    politics has changed now, too. It's not what it used to be. When I was a new
                    commissioner - this is, I think kind of funny. Bob Wilson, who used to be
                    president of U.S. Bank, and Jack Meier of Meier &amp; Frank, and all that, they
                    were on the Port Commission, and Ray Kell was from the Commission of Public
                    Docks and all that.</p>
                <p>But they were dishing out - and I don't think they even do it anymore, but we
                    were in an executive session dishing out the trips. And that to me was one of
                    the real perks of this job, was getting to see Japan and Europe and a few
                    things, and it didn't cost you too much money personally. And at that time I
                    didn't have much money personally.</p>
                <p>And we did a lot of work. We worked on those jobs. Bunevertheless, it was fun
                    work.</p>
                <p>Anyway, they came up to the first travel meeting, and I'm the freshman on it,
                    see, the odd man out. And they announced it, and for the first year I was going
                    to be put on the Multnomah County Drainage District No. 1. [laughing] I went to
                    Gresham once a month. They thought it was the funniest thing in the world. And I
                    did; by God, I went to the Multnomah County Drainage District No. 1.</p>
                <p>And then we got a Democrat on, a pretty strong Democrat named Glenn O'Dell, who
                    was an engineer. And I said to him, I said, “Glenn, you wouldn't like to take my
                    spot of the Multnomah County Drainage District No. 1, would you, because you're
                    far more qualified than I?”</p>
                <p>He said, “I'd love that.”</p>
                <p>I said, “You've got it.” Then I got to go to Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you could actually influence the assignments?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>GREEN: Well, after my year of Multnomah - Yes, they promised me I'd only have it
                    for a year. But you see, when the governors turned - I think it was nine of us,
                    and you know, it was five and four if the Democrat was governor. And we had
                    Straub, and then when Straub came on, I stayed on for six more months, Jim
                    Thayer, myself and some others stayed on for six more months because the drydock
                    was being floated from Japan over, and we knew about that, and we knew the
                    intricacies as far as the Port Commission goes. So we stayed on another six
                    months. I said I would, and so did Jim. And then once the drydock was here, we
                    went off the Port, and Bob Straub got to pick his people. And he was very
                    gracious about it, Straub.</p>
                <p>And then Vic, I ran Vic's campaign, and we beat Straub. And Vic says, “Is there
                    anything in particular?” I said, “Yes, I'd like to go back on the Port. I really
                    loved that.” So he put me back on the Port, and they made me president again,
                    which I loved. Then I had to leave for Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does a person get out of the Port? You talked about
                        there'a prestige...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: That's it. That's about it. But I don't even know whether now it's the
                    same. Nobody seems to know much about it. I know that Bob Ames was the chairman
                    for a long time, and he was very close to Neil Goldschmidt, and Neil changed
                    things somewhat. Bob just stayed, as near as I can make out. He stayed President
                    of the Port for quite a while.</p>
                <p>I don't see much about the Port Commission much anymore. I know this fellow
                    Powell of Powell Books is on it. I've never met him, but he's on, or was on it.
                    But I just don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there isn't anything like advantage to business if you
                        are othe Port?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, not really. I'll tell you, it's almost a disadvantage, as far as I was
                    concerned. You remember when the - well, you know what the construction phase is
                    now we're going through, but when I was on the Port Commission, they had a big
                    job at the airport. I didn't bid it because I was President of the Port.</p>
                <p>Well, they got a guy in, a contractor in from the East for the glass and all
                    that. And they couldn't perform. And Lloyd called me just in desperation -
                    because in all modesty, we had the best glass company for big jobs - we still
                    do, it still is; it's a fantastic company - he said, “You've got to go out
                    there.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, you know my position. I want clearance in writing from the Oregon
                    Ethics Commission. Our company is busy at this time, and I would have to pull my
                    best people off jobs to complete the job within your time constraints - I also
                    intend to make a fair profit on this job - we will not gouge you though.”</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>When I finally talked to the Government Ethics Office and we had agreed on
                    details - I said to this bureaucrat “My company intends to make a profit on the
                    airport job.”</p>
                <p>His reply was, “How else would you stay in business.”</p>
                <p>I found this a most healthy attitude - we completed the job on time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Over the years with the Port, what were you principal
                        interestand sort of your driving interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, just - I'm competitive by nature, and I wanted to beat Seattle, if I
                    could. Very difficult because Seattle had Puget Sound - and I noticed the
                    airport now is starting to go pretty good with Delta and all of that, but it
                    would irritate me, it irritates me to this day when I pick up a newspaper, say,
                    the New York Times, and it's got Seattle, and then it skips and then it goes
                    down to San Francisco showing the weather pattern. I mean, it just irritates me.
                    I'm proud of this place. I love Portland, Oregon, and I love my state of Oregon,
                    and I just - you know, it just - I love being the underdog, I really do. It's
                    more fun being an underdog. If you can bite a little bit, it's just great. And
                    we did pretty well.</p>
                <p>I'll tell you, when I was appointed chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission,
                    Seattle went nuts. They had me up there, and I had to promise them that I'd
                    treat them equally and all this sort of thing. They were scared to death that I
                    was going to do something.</p>
                <p>And then Portland came back to see me after I'd been on the job for about a year,
                    and they said - we went to lunch, and they said, “Punch, can we bring something
                    up?” I said, “Sure, anything.” He said, “You know, you want to treat Seattle and
                    Portland fairly, and we understand that, but how about treating Portland fairly,
                    too?” I guess I'd overdone it, gone the other way, been afraid that some of the
                    regulations might favor Portland a little bit more than Seattle and all that. So
                    we straightened that out in a hurry, too. I saw to it that Portland was treated
                    equally to Seattle.</p>
                <p>Q: That's just an interesting large subject. There were some things that I
                    encountered. There was a port equalization agreement in 1974, and I'd like to
                    know more about the full story of that. There's talk about the hinterland for
                    each port that's recognized in this agreement, and they're dealing with problems
                    of cargo pirating. There's the Pacific Westbound Conference that's accused of
                    that. What's going on and what is this agreement?</p>
                <p>GREEN: That's when I'm on the Port here. I'm not back in Washingtoon that
                    one.</p>

                <p>GREEN: Well, yes, it sounds that way, but I think it's kind of like a excess
                    profits tax. It sounds good, but there isn't such a thing. I don't have much
                    recollection of it, and maybe I should, but it wasn't that big a deal with
                    me.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No. Vancouver was a competitive relationship. Vancouver, Washington, there
                    was a competitive relationship, and they were darn good. They had some tax
                    things going for them. But it was Seattle-Tacoma, that was what it was.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I think we talked about that a little bit, but the thing about Astoria is
                    we weren't opposed to - they're hard up for money; it makes sense, doesn't it,
                    to bring these huge cargo ships right into Astoria, unload them in Astoria, but
                    how do you get them out of Astoria? You've got to have a whole new system of
                    railroads, roads and everything to get them up here, to get them dispersed out.
                    That's the problem.</p>

                <p>GREEN: Portland really is the key distribution point. Portland is a better
                    distribution point than Seattle. They've got - what have they got? - they've got
                    Northern Pacific - we've got everything coming in here.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: We used to do some Alaska trade. But you're right, Seattle - but Seattle,
                    who does Seattle fight on the Alaska trade? They don't have it all. They fight
                    Vancouver, BC on the Alaska trade.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, you guys had a meeting with Seattle; for the first time, everybody went
                    up and met with them. I thought that sounded really interesting.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, it was fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it was in Seattle in '79. That's so funny that the
                        twcommissions didn't get together before then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I think that we instigated that one. It was high time. It was just a
                    get-together. I think it was more a get acquainted type of thing. I thought it
                    was enjoyable. I vaguely kind of remember this thing. It wasn't a crossroads
                    type of thing, but it was a good idea. Communication is a good idea.</p>
                <p>Q: In the reportage that I saw, they said that your committee people - you
                    commissioners were impressed by Seattle's control of recreational facilities.
                    And then when the Commission got back to Portland, they began to look into those
                    possibilities, and they were met with opposition, led by Jim Crest and so forth.
                    Do you remember what was going on then?</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>GREEN: No, it wasn't a big item. They were doing some things better than we were,
                    but they had more money than we did. I mean, their airport was getting much more
                    play than - it was the Portland International Airport; that's under the control
                    of the Port Commission - when I was on the Commission the only reason it was
                    called International is because we had one flight a day from Victoria to
                    Portland - or Vancouver, BC, I guess, to Portland on Western Airlines. That
                    makes it international. It was an entirely different ball game. We were really
                    small potatoes compared to what was going on up north.</p>
                <p>But we've caught up - I mean, we're catching up. A lot of theirs is they don't
                    have any land to expand to control much more, and we do. So it works out.</p>
                <p>I think one of the most unpopular things I've ever been involved in is when we -
                    the Port Commission, we wanted to put an airport - we've got three airports.
                    Where the hell was this airport? Tualatin, something like that. Anyway, it was a
                    spot that people - it was a small feeder airport, take the load of the private
                    jets and the small planes to take them off the big airport, so less
                    dangerous.</p>
                <p>And we went out to those meetings, and I'm trying to think where iwas.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, there was Hillsboro and then there was one in Clackamas County.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, okay. It was in Clackamas County, I think. And we were just roasted.
                    And I'd sit there, and I would - I mean, I was afraid for my life getting out of
                    there - but we'd sit there and take it at night. Boy, were they bitter. I think
                    we had...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the deal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: They didn't want an airport. They didn't want anything like that. And I
                    couldn't blame them, they had all sorts of ideas about the noise and crashing
                    and the inter-exchanges, and they just wanted their own rural area. They didn't
                    want it. I couldn't blame them much, really; they were fed the wrong
                    information.</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact, I think we ended up with a small airport there.You could
                    check that out. I'm not sure. But boy, were they bitter.</p>
                <p>Q: I haven't really noticed whether an airport went in or not. I thought that the
                    idea of putting an airport out there was part of offering some value to
                    Clackamas County. When the boundaries of the Port district were enlarged in '73,
                    I kept thinking this must be their way of telling these people, “You are going
                    to get something for being...”</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, they didn't want it. They didn't want it. Boy! think it was
                    them.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>Q: Why were they increasing the boundaries? What was the need? I can begin to
                    imagine, but I'd like to know more about it. In '73 they went to the legislature
                    and got the boundaries enlarged.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I think the Port has always felt, and I think rightfully so, that
                    they have the management and the expertise to guide this thing pretty well. The
                    Port is so much larger than people have any idea. The Port is - I mean, the
                    airport here is just a huge undertaking, and profitable, extremely profitable to
                    the citizens of this area by the landing fees and things like that, and also, of
                    course, the shops - I don't know whether it's profitable now with the
                    construction going on, but once it gets all done - the shops and all of that,
                    the fees from all that sort of stuff.</p>
                <p>And then of course you've got Pier 6, is something we did. We calleit John Fulton
                    Terminal after John died.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was paid for it, a lot of it, out of revenues from the
                        airport?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Bonds, too. Bonds paid for it. And they've never had to worry about a Port
                    of Portland bond. So you know, at the time the expenditure - what was it,
                    $600,000, I'm guessing, to float the drydock from Japan to Portland and build
                    there; I mean, it was enormous. We were going to pick up the Alaska trade on the
                    tankers. Didn't happen. I don't know whether that's been successful or not.
                    Anyway, the bonds got paid off; it's been that successful.</p>
                <p>Nothing that I can see has ever cost the citizens of this area anything. I think
                    if you look at cities around the country, Omaha and places are different, but if
                    you look at New York, you look at Seattle, you look at a lot of these - San
                    Francisco, the main reason they're there is because of their port, because of
                    the water. The main reason. And the Columbia River and Willamette River is why
                    Portland's where it is, where it can blossom out and speed things on its way.
                    It's terrific, when you think about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The dredging was essential to that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: The dredging has to be at 15 feet. The Corps of Engineerkeep it there. And
                    now I guess they're going for a little deeper stuff.</p>
                <p>Q: Forty-foot channel.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Forty-foot channel, yes. I'd kind of forgotten all about that. That's the
                    Corps of Engineers. They've got a barge digging all the time. It's got the Port
                    emblem on it, I think.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I guess so. It's kind of like I guess you've got to disturb some of
                    these things, if you're going to have it. It's like Ross Island Sand and Gravel;
                    the sand had been there for years and years and years, and all of a sudden they
                    find out that they're doing something wrong, something they've been doing for 50
                    years. I don't know - you've just got to get along, that's all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A similar issue is the barge traffic up the Columbia
                        system.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: That's been fixed a lot, hasn't it, by Bonneville? Hasn'that been fixed a
                    lot by the new gates and things at Bonneville?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To facilitate the barge traffic? I think so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I think it has. We had that problem, but we got started so that Bonneville
                    - because I remember Lloyd Anderson and I, along with some others, we took the
                    steamer Portland all the way up to Lewiston, and the people were coming out all
                    up as we went by waving to us, and bridges were all full when we'd go under
                    them, waving to us. We'd have a party every night, and I was in charge of
                    getting them on the boat and off the boat because I couldn't drink.</p>
                <p>But that was quite a - I've forgotten exactly when I did that, but I remember
                    Pauline Anderson met us in Hood River and drove Lloyd and I home. But that was a
                    four or five days trip. That was very interesting, and we made a lot of friends
                    for the Port. That was the idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did they go to Lewiston? What's the advantage?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Because that's as high as you can go, I think. Wanted to show that it
                    could be done and get the barges out and get them down here and more wheat and
                    all that sort of stuff. I think it was just kind of an opening thing.</p>

                        Seattle is landlord port. I wonder if you could talk about those

                <p>GREEN: Landlord port? And we're an operating port?</p>

                        someonwould say, “Let's get to be a non-operating port.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, I think it's probably the landlord port would be that the private
                    people would own the facilities, and they're responsible for making a profit or
                    loss and the upkeep. Whereas operating, we're responsible, and we keep the
                    profits or the losses. I think that's probably what it is. And then what we'll
                    do is - this is just a guess, but I think I'm right on it - we'll charge them or
                    they'll pay a fee or something for the use of facilities and that sort of thing
                    to us. I guess we own it.</p>
                <p>Q: It sounds like operating means we own the dock facilities, and that's our
                    business.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. It's probably right. It's been like that for years.</p>

                <p>GREEN: Of course, you've got to realize I've been out of Portlanfor about 10

                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>Q: In '71 there was an eight-month strike and so forth. I was wondering if talk
                    about, “Hey, let's get away from being an operating port.” I wonder if that was
                    motivated by the labor troubles.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, it might have been. We had a wonderful guy on the Commission named Joe
                    Edgar, who was head of the Teamsters. And I used to just turn to Joe for advice
                    on that sort of thing. You know, they all sleep together, these guys.</p>

                    I ran into them in the Federal Maritime Commission, and we'll talk about that

                    the Port's dealings?</p>
                <p>GREEN: I don't think we had that difficult a time. Sure, we had differences of
                    opinion, but I don't recall it as being anything that serious. I had labor
                    problems down at Benson once; it was terrible. Six weeks.</p>

                    us and didn't take on the others because we were the biggest. The glaziers were
                    sending me postcards from Alaska where they were fishing that said, “Don't
                    settle it yet.” I had bought a new car, but I didn't dare drive it down to the

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They knew they could send you a card like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, sure. They were good friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And know it wasn't inflammatory.</hi>

                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>GREEN: No, it wasn't, as far as I was concerned. No, I got a kick out of it. I
                    laughed and I said, “Well, have a good time, boys. I hope you get a big one and
                    bring me back some salmon.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there were some jurisdictional disputes, one
                        uniostruggling with another union.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. You have to realize newspapers have to - and television, the news
                    media in order to prosper has to print controversial news. I mean, they can't
                    say a plane landed safely in Portland, Oregon; that's not hardly news. Plane
                    crashed in Portland, Oregon, yes, that's news. And that's what people read. You
                    don't read the good news; you might read about weddings and things like that,
                    but...</p>
                <p>Q: Well, that's really an interesting picture of labor relations at the Port.
                    Sounds like it wasn't a hard-nosed, hardball sort of relationship.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I don't recall it as being. You've got to believe that that's '70,
                    that's 20- some-odd - quite a while ago. But it wasn't a big thing with me. You
                    know, when you're a commissioner, you're going about your own life doing your
                    own things. It's not your prime responsibility. It's Ed Westerdahl or Lloyd
                    Anderson, people like that's prime responsibility.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that would be a good idea to bring out. How often
                        did yomeet, and what...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: We met once a month, publicly. Publicly once a month. If whad a quorum, of
                    course, we had to meet publicly.</p>
                <p>Q: On that original board, the members were Borden Beck, Jack Meier, Robert
                    Wilson, Ray Kell, Ed Whelan, labor man, Robert Rickett, John Fulton and Walter
                    Gadsby.</p>
                <p>GREEN: That's right.</p>
                <p>Q: It would be nice to have some commentary on the personalities, but it would be
                    good to know about the different purposes that members had, and also how they
                    related with one another - sort of how things worked, what you may recall.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I think the key guy from the Commission of Public Dockis Ray Kell. I
                    think that Rickett - is that his name?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>GREEN: - looked at him very closely. I think John Fulton watched how Ray felt
                    very closely. But John was more of a leader, too. But he's...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were close.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, they were close, and Ray was used to things happeninhis way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Ray Kell was a powerful guy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, he was used to having his way. We didn't give it to him a lot of
                    times. But on the whole, I was supposed to be the swing vote, and it never
                    happened. It never happened - what did we have, nine of us? How many people did
                    we have on there?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Two, four, six, eight - and nine, that's you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Okay. So I was the swing vote. It was never five to four.It was always -
                    that I can recall, it wasn't a five to four vote.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Swing vote between Ds [Democrats] and Rs
                        [Republicans]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: The swing vote on the issues. But sometimes it comes to that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, this is Tom McCall, is that right, saying...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, he didn't say anything. I'd rather not say who said it, as a matter of
                    fact. And I said, “I'm aware of that. I can do the math.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Swing between what and what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, at that time nobody knew how the Commission of Public Docks and the
                    Port of Portland were going to work together. Nobody knew. And so it might go
                    four and four; if it goes four and four, “Punch, how are you going to vote?” But
                    it never came to that. I felt very good about it.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>We got along very well, really. Borden Beck was a fantastic guy; he was a lawyer.
                    You'd love him, he's very much of an environmentalist. God, he got so excited,
                    he found an arrowhead in Eastern Oregon. He wanted me to go to Eastern Oregon
                    with him to look for arrowheads, and I politely declined. But I loved him. He
                    was a lawyer down here with Harvey Black.</p>
                <p>And let's see, who else you got? There was Bob Wilson, still alive and living in
                    Seattle. He was the president of a bank, and he was one of the world's great
                    guys. Jack Meier, one of the funniest men I've ever known, and I just love him.
                    He's the one that got the biggest kick out of my going out to the Multnomah
                    County Sewage District No. 1.</p>
                <p>And who else is there?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ed Whelan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Ed Whelan was just great. He is one of the great, I thought at the time,
                    one of the great labor leaders because he was either way - he would see the
                    Republican position very fast, and if it was right, he'd say it. And with Ed I
                    felt very comfortable saying anything I'm saying to you, and I don't think Ed
                    would argue with too much I've said today about this thing. He was not one of
                    these - one of these tough labor leaders, like I was afraid Joe Edgar might be,
                    and it ends up he's a pussycat and a wonderful guy.</p>
                <p>People - you know, people are different when you get to know them. They've got an
                    aura about them and all that, but once you get underneath it, they're all about
                    alike.</p>
                <p>Q: So for the people who you might expect to be hostile or have some problems
                    with labor guys, with Joe Edgar and Ed Whelan, it just did not happen.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Didn't happen, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the real divisions in there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, sometimes I think Ray would try to get a few things bthat we didn't
                    want. I can't say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kinds of things?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I just remember feeling a little uncomfortable. It wasn't anything
                    where he would profit from it, that sort of thing, but I think they had a way of
                    doing things that we weren't used to, and maybe we wanted it done another way or
                    something. I was just - I can't really be specific, so maybe I shouldn't say it,
                    but you're asking me to comment on the individuals. I can't comment on the
                    instances because it's too far in the past, and it wasn't that important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John Fulton.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: John Fulton was - he died, and so that's when we named thFulton Terminal
                    after him. He spent a great deal of time on it.</p>
                <p>John Fulton was a very good politician, and he wanted it done - you know, he
                    would watch Ray Kell all the time. I mean, I'll be honest with you, he just -
                    you know, he was the leader. The public, as far as they were concerned, Fulton
                    was the guy. But I used to watch him, and he was pretty sure Ray Kell was voting
                    that way before he'd say too much. I think he was more afraid of the guy than he
                    was anything else. And that's kind of mean to say, I guess, because he was a
                    good guy, and I would see him in the hospital. His last words to me were, “Take
                    care of the Port, Punch.” (End of tape)</p>
                <p>So you could always get - from Walter you could always get the expertise from the
                    owners' standpoint of the maritime end of it. So he was invaluable in that
                    way.</p>
                <p>Q: There was a flap over the succession, the way the succession worked out, when
                    Anderson came in, and it was, I think, Walter Gadsby who complained the loudest
                    and most publicly that he hadn't been notified of the succession, that Anderson
                    was going to come on early and...</p>
                <p>GREEN: Anderson was there for quite a while while Ed was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, right. And Gadsby, this was in the press, and Gadsby
                        wavery upset that he hadn't been kept abreast of what was going on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: That might be true. Probably an oversight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the explanation seemed to be that Anderson was
                        considering a run for Congress.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Might have been.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>Q: Okay. Can you give me a sense of the difference better Westerdahl and
                    Anderson? What's the comparison of the two, running the Port, and just in
                    general?</p>
                <p>GREEN: There's not as much difference as you might think. Their styles are
                    different. Anderson's a lot softer, and he wouldn't get that upset - but I've
                    seen him mad. But things would get done under Anderson as well as they'd get
                    done under Westerdahl.</p>
                <p>I think Westerdahl had a far tougher assignment because by the time Lloyd got
                    there things were going, I mean, we had an organization, we'd worked out a lot
                    of this stuff. But when Westerdahl came in, and he didn't know what to expect,
                    either. We went out and had a little lunch before I went on, I'll be honest with
                    you, and talked about this thing a little bit. And I said, “Well, I promise you
                    that I'll do all I can to help you, within reason,” because he and I had become
                    friends from the McCall campaign.</p>
                <p>But you know, the difference between the two isn't that meaningful. I think
                    Westerdahl was there at the right time, was the right guy for that time. I also
                    think Westerdahl should have left when he left because I think he'd done about
                    what he could do, and brought in a guy that was in a way more of a bureaucrat or
                    a softer guy, and that's Lloyd. And Lloyd's got a fantastic wife, too, you know,
                    Pauline. She can give awfully good advice. Pauline Anderson used to be county
                    commissioner here and all that.</p>
                <p>I think both of them were there at the right time, and I didn't see Lloyd get
                    ruffled, and he had some ruffling things that were going on, but I never saw him
                    get ruffled particularly. Ed would get ruffled, but I was ruffled, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you talk about some of the ruffling, some of the
                        issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, we'd just get criticized sometimes, and, oh, prima donnas would attach
                    themselves. Had one lady, I'd forgotten her name, that was her thing was to
                    follow the Port of Portland. Every meeting. We'd go out on the steamer Portland,
                    she'd go along. I'll never forget once, she said to me - and I was president,
                    and we were coming up the Columbia to Swan Island and the drydocks, and they
                    were busy, fortunately, and things like that. She said, “Well, how does it feel
                    having control of all this,” or something, to me, see. And I said, “Well, how
                    does it feel for you to have control of it? You're a citizen, too; I don't own
                    it.” And she said, “Well, you know what I mean.” She didn't like that, see.</p>
                <p>But you'd get those people, and you'd get some stuff that was kind of - if you
                    really know a subject, you get unjust letters to the editor because they're
                    jealous, this is a big operation. It employs an awful lot of people, and the
                    positive ripple effects of the Port of Portland in this area are unbelievable.
                    Unbelievable.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>But I'd say that's probably the difference in the two. They werdifferent types of
                    people, there at the right time, both of them.</p>
                <p>Q: Gee, there was a point at which a representative from Eugene helped turn
                    around the expansion - in the legislature, expanding the boundaries of the Port,
                    and she instituted a new vote in the house, and I've got her name in here
                    somewhere, but she was saying even Lane County benefits from the existence of
                    the - well, the good management of the Port.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Of course. Of course. Ripple, sure. I had a tough time getting - what was
                    it? - I think I had a tough time getting appointed, I think the second time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, they were holding up your appointment for a time.
                        GREEN: They were holding up my appointment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A guy by the name of Bullock, Representative Bullock.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: That's right, Bullock.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was going on there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I don't know. It was - I don't know. I was warned of it when I walked into
                    the chamber. I thought it was going to be, you know, just a walk-through. I'm
                    not sure. It got resolved. I remember being a little frustrated by it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That came probably not long after the criticism of the
                        expensaccounts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, we had criticism of the expense accounts when Nixon was in town. We
                    went down and entertained - Ed and I and a couple others went down and
                    entertained some people at the London Grill; they were there for the reception.
                    And I didn't have my credit card with me, I think that was it, and so Ed picked
                    up the tab, and it was three or four hundred dollars.</p>
                <p>Then I'd gotten busy, and then once I said to him, “How much was that, because I
                    don't think the Port should pay it,” I said, “I should pay it.” And we got it,
                    and I paid him back, or I paid the Port back, whatever it was. But in the
                    meantime somebody had found out that Westerdahl paid for that thing, and I said,
                    “No, I paid for it,” but that was done afterwards. So yes, they made a big thing
                    out of that. I remember that, yes, vaguely.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>But that's what they could do to you. You've got to be so careful I mean, nobody
                    thanks you for putting in tens of thousands of dollars trying to help people and
                    things like that; they try to nail you for a $300 dinner or something like that.
                    I mean, I paid it, and I paid it voluntarily before this thing broke, didn't
                    even think about it. But it just irritates me that there are people out there
                    that want to do that sort of thing to you on the expense account. They should
                    have taken the time to see it had been resolved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I think Willamette Week was looking for issues.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes, Willamette Week. that's right. That's right, it was Willamette
                    Week. You're right. I knew there was something about Willamette Week I didn't
                    particularly like, and I guess that's it. Going back to that. I got the check. I
                    still - after all that thing, I think it's in my safe deposit box.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then the Port changed its rules.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, we changed our rules so that would never happen again.</p>
                <p>Q: Another issue that came up that I thought was really an interesting one, and
                    this is in '74, was a move by the Port - an appeal for federal funds. The Port
                    bypassed CRAG, the Columbia Regional Area Government, and Neil Goldschmidt
                    reacted very strongly to that.</p>
                <p>GREEN: That would be under mine because I wasn't there when Neil wathere.
                    '74?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In reading this, I actually couldn't get what the issue
                        was. was totally puzzled.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I don't know, either.</p>
                <p>Q: Relationship between the Port and CRAG. Another point at which the Port got
                    involved in regional affairs was an amicable one, but they took on - this is in
                    '79 - a transportation study for the City of Portland. And I thought how unusual
                    that the Port would undertake a study of transportation needs for the
                    region.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>GREEN: They were probably the only ones that could afford it. You know, it's a
                    profitable organization, and sometimes you have to do those things. I don't know
                    what the transportation studies would entail. It wouldn't be something in here.
                    If we're going to do it as a public agency you can't just - it would have to be
                    transportation studies of freight coming in or airport or something like that;
                    there could be transportation studies along that line. But it would have to be
                    in something where the Port itself has some sort of involvement. You can't just
                    go out and spend money to help Mayor Katz because she doesn't have the money. It
                    doesn't work that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like something that would come out of Anderson,
                        who halots of connections with...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: It could, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...Portland planning.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, yes, that's right. He was involved with that. They still have a
                    commission, of course, but seems to me we served on it for two years or
                    something like that, then we'd go off and then get reappointed - or maybe it was
                    four years. That was it, four years, and then we'd get reappointed as the
                    governor's term - but it was staggered.</p>
                <p>And then with the president of the Port, he would be president for one year, and
                    then we would circulate it around among us. And then when Neil came in, I think
                    he jut changed it somewhat and just had Bob Ames as the president, period, and
                    the others were commissioners, which seems to be working pretty well. Bob's not
                    - I don't know who it is now; I don't think Bob's still involved.</p>
                <p>I think our system was better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the advantage of your system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, it gave you a chance to be the president and see all the others.
                    You'd work your way up through the secretarial, the vice president, and that
                    sort of thing. You'd get a pretty good feel for it. You're not a spectator; you
                    know that at some time you're going to have to lead. So you learn something.</p>
                <p>But I don't know, for some reason they wanted to change it. I'talking about Neil
                    Goldschmidt.</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>When Bob Straub was elected, certain of us went off, and then Vic beat Bob. So
                    it's just structurally a little bit different, but I don't think there's been
                    any harm because you get back to how important is a commission? A commission can
                    really screw everything up, I mean if they get a bunch of guys that are - or
                    women that are doing it the wrong way with the wrong ideas, but it's who you've
                    got running it, day to day - because all of us have got our own problems with
                    our own businesses, our own lives.</p>
                <p>Q: On the report of the changes under Atiyeh, when you came in back in '79,
                    returned, the comment was that this board here is inexperienced, and it's
                    politicized, these are campaign people - three of them were campaign people from
                    Atiyeh's election effort and also that the emphasis is now on business as
                    opposed to social needs. Now, that's describing quite a change. Can you comment
                    on that?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Probably pretty justified, but I don't think that's criticism. Number one,
                    you're right, I've always felt that the best political plum, if you want to say,
                    that a governor can give is the - I suppose Chairman of the Highway Commission
                    would rank in there - but would be the Port of Portland Commission, because of
                    the interest in the life of the population.</p>
                <p>As far as the criticism of experience, I don't think that would apply to me
                    because I'd been there for several years before, and successfully. You get
                    experience very fast. As I said earlier today, all things are common sense, and
                    all things you've got to look at, and if you don't have the answer what you do
                    is you go out and you find somebody that has the answer that you trust, and you
                    get it. And they've got a staff over there that's fantastic, and you go to them
                    and ask them, and you say, “Well, you're not getting an independent appraisal” -
                    well, they aren't that, it's for the benefit of the whole community. It's not
                    something to benefit Punch Green, for example. It's to benefit everybody in the
                    community; that's what your philosophy has to be. They're paying for it.</p>
                <p>So you know, you get those criticisms, and in a way they're justified. The words
                    are a little harsh, I think. I don't think that's fair.</p>

                <p>Q: One of his staffers - you know, a journalist got to a staffer on this subject,
                    and the Straub guy said, “Well, the problem with the board that you have now,
                    the commission is a bunch of big shots. We've got to have more ordinary people
                    on it.” Now, that's a kind of a...</p>

                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that's politicizing it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: But why aren't there ordinary people, too - what do they want, do they
                    want some janitor sitting in there - not to degrade a janitor, but I mean, what
                    do they - you've got labor in there, I mean, you've got big-shot labor, but
                    you've got them in there. They know the wants and needs of their people. What do
                    you want, a bellboy? I mean, is that what you want?</p>

                <p>GREEN: I thought they were good.</p>

                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>GREEN: No. They were all politicized. It's the individual that counts; it's not
                    the fact that it's politicized. If you politicize it with the wrong people, men
                    or women, you've got a problem. You can use another word than “politicized.” I
                    mean, it just carries a bad connotation, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it's quality of appointments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Quality of appointments is everything, either side. thought we had good
                    quality.</p>
                <p>Q: In asking you about the subject of the missions, the trade missions, kind of
                    uppermost in my interest is how they worked and how they had effect. You know,
                    what actually was transacted, what came out of these missions?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I'll tell you one that I thought was extremely successful, and this
                    affected all - Westerdahl and I went to Japan, and I think there were a couple
                    others, and we took a train from Tokyo down to Toyota, and I think we met Dr.
                    Toyota and spent some time with him. And about a year later, Toyota's coming
                    into Portland. I don't think it would have happened if we hadn't gone there.</p>
                <p>They weren't all that successful. Do you want to hear a funny story? I'm in
                    Japan, and I don't know anything about it, but I figured out if I get a
                    matchbook of the hotel, I show that to the driver, he'll take me back - because
                    the hotel doorman would always say where I should go, to the taxi. So after the
                    appointment's through, I'd take my matchbook out and show him the picture of the
                    hotel with the name and everything, and he'd nod and take me back. And one guy
                    took me to a match factory. [Laughs] So I got a guy to write out a little card
                    and say where I'm staying. Honestly, that was the truth. Gosh, I just died. I
                    love to tell that story.</p>
                <p>But it's wonderful for us that had a chance to do it. And if you say we didn't
                    have fun or something, we did have fun. We had a wonderful time. But you know,
                    it was a constructive time. You were always on duty. You had breakfasts, lunches
                    and dinners with potential people and suppliers. And then of course we
                    established an office in Tokyo.</p>
                <p>We went to Europe. We went to places like that. You get to see the world that
                    you'd never seen, on the cheap, that's for sure, but you're working for the
                    people. And I think it pays for itself. I hope it did. I'll guarantee you Toyota
                    did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there needs to be the envoy. I'm just interested,

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: With him? It was in a small office, as I recall. I wasn't impressed by the
                    office. I thought it would be a huge thing; it wasn't. He seemed very nice. I
                    think we had an interpreter. And we were telling him - we had pamphlets, of
                    course, or literature about the Port - that we were thinking about specializing.
                    And we realized Seattle - I've always believed in saying your competitor, just
                    say it right out - great port, but with us you're going to get a personal - and
                    you'd be the first, and all that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>And you know, we didn't hear anything. We knew we'd done well, yocan get that
                    feel when you leave. Thanked him.</p>
                <p>

                <p>GREEN: I can't recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe the staff did that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I'm sure it was all involved in that. I wrote him a thanyou letter for his
                    time. But then nothing happened.</p>
                <p>There's a lot of business that's here - a lot of times you'll go to the source of
                    the steamship, where is the steamship located. We went to Norway, and we'd go
                    out in the fjords, and that's where the steamship companies have their
                    headquarters, and that sort of thing - which was a fascinating thing to do; I'm
                    not going to argue that. I mean, people spend thousands of dollars to go out on
                    those fjords to see them.</p>
                <p>But we were going to get them to call at the Port of Portland, and some of them
                    do now, some of them did. They go back and forth - it's very easy to get them to
                    go to Seattle; it's will they come to Portland, will they top off in Portland, a
                    lot of times, because I's more expensive to come up the river.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Top off means -?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, if they haven't got a full load after - and we've goenough down here
                    to -.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>It's not so bad now, but it used to be discouraging as hell for me, you'd drive
                    to Seattle, and I'd see all these containers going to Seattle, trucks full of
                    containers that should be going out of Portland.But a lot of that has been
                    straightened out with the railroads. We're doing more out there now, I notice.
                    The Port's doing a good job.</p>
                <p>Q: Did personal relationships with people, Europeans, Japanese and so forth, did
                    they follow from this? Was there a sort of personal relationship follow-up?
                    Would they visit over here and you would see them?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. Sure, and you'd have them to the house for dinner and things of
                    that sort - which I'd usually pay for, I was so paranoid about the other. I
                    wouldn't charge the Port.</p>
                <p>And it helped me with the FMC because I got to know some of those people in
                    Japan, when I went over there as Chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission.
                    Once I made a swing through the Orient, and I was the - I hadn't been confirmed
                    yet as Chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission, and it was an interesting
                    trip. I was still president of the Port of Portland. So Portland said, “Well,
                    that won't be any conflict to do that,” and I said, “No, I don't think so.”</p>
                <p>So we went out, and Joan went with me, which I paid for. But anyway, she - boy,
                    they greeted us like we've never been greeted before because they knew what was
                    coming for me, see, and how much - I think that's what made Seattle so nervous,
                    too. But it was good for the Port of Portland, very good.</p>
                <p>The work in the Port of Portland really is in the marine end of it, getting it
                    in. The airlines you don't - unless it might have changed, too - you don't spend
                    as much time. Land development, yes, and I suppose the acreage, the additional.
                    I will tell you one thing we did, however, with Westerdahl, myself and - oh,
                    who's that great architect that we've got here? - Bob Frasca, I think it's
                    Frasca - anyway, they had done most of the work at the Port, at least most of
                    it.So three or four of us got in an airplane, and we flew all over the country.
                    Stopped overnight in Texas, overnight in Florida, overnight in New York,
                    overnight in Chicago. And we were picking up ideas for the terminal. Came back,
                    and then all of us separated and sat down and wrote the ideas that we had picked
                    up and then put them in there and tried to incorporate it as much as we could
                    into the new terminal - not this new one, but the one in the '80s. And a lot of
                    it is still there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had some real direct input in the design of the
                        terminal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I did, yes, as a commissioner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you talk about your ideas that, you know, had an
                        effect in...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>GREEN: Well, one thing I wanted for sure was I wanted them, a person to come into
                    the Portland terminal and know that they were in Oregon. How many places do you
                    fly into, and you've got no idea where you are? I don't care, big places, it
                    doesn't make any difference. So I thought we needed Oregon shops, Made in Oregon
                    shops type of thing, and we have that. (End of tape)</p>

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: And going through Portland or one of them by rail and thegoing right

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I'm not sure it hasn't been pretty well put into effect. I mean, not that
                    you're ever going to get something like that, I guess, but that concept has been
                    a great help to Portland, and I think we've gotten a lot of freight. Now, that
                    was a help, for example, with the automobiles because they would come in - they
                    get washed here, and if you can believe it the fellow that had that job, he made
                    a fortune washing the cars and fixing them up, and then they'd send them on
                    their way in the freight cars to New York or something. They didn't send them
                    on, but I mean it was kind of a land bridge type of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it does work with the automobile?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I think so. Maybe they all stayed around here, but think they were -
                    but the land bridge is a valid concept, can be.</p>
                <p>The thing is, it's a huge amount of equipment and a huge amount of cost to get
                    any of this stuff going. I mean, you're talking about real money.</p>
                <p>

                <p>This is a continuation of the oral history with Punch Green. Todais the 25th of
                    May, 1999. So you were reminded of...</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I was reminded before we go on about the FMC, the Federal Maritime
                    Commission, one of two things. Number one, Mabel Bishop, Mabel Livingston
                    Bishop, who was my secretary at Dooly &amp; Company and went to Ainsworth and we
                    grew up together, but she went on to become a fantastic success in a volunteer
                    way at Mt. Vernon, which is, of course, where George Washington, the father of
                    our country, lived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She had a title of regent? GREEN: Regent of Mt.
                        Vernon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And so was she in DC when you were at the Federal
                        MaritimCommission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, she was there when they had meetings - she actually lived in Oregon.
                    When Mort Bishop, her husband, wasn't in town she'd call me if she needed
                    somebody for a reception and I'd come over. Joanie was usually on the Pacific
                    Coast or something.</p>
                <p>But anyway, another thing I wanted to bring out was a favor done for me that I
                    had forgotten, and it was by Don Sterling, who was the editor of the Oregon
                    Journal at the time.</p>
                <p>It was when I was having all that trouble with the Port of Portland in getting
                    reappointed, and they were looking into things that we were doing and all that
                    sort of stuff. And this guy wrote a pretty nasty - I've forgotten his name - a
                    pretty nasty piece about me, and it wasn't true. And my worry was my mother
                    because she was very proud of me. So I bought an extra paper and went up and sat
                    down and watched her read it, and she started to cry a little bit and you know,
                    I explained it to her and she was fine.</p>
                <p>But Don Sterling is the guy I called, he was out of town. He came back, and he
                    returned my call, and he apologized for the article. And I said, “Well, I know
                    your mother; how would you like to take that to your mother and have her read it
                    if it's not true?” And he said, “I wouldn't.” And he wrote me a letter, said I
                    could use it at any time, and I think it's in my safe deposit box or somewhere.
                    But I might add at that time they did write an editorial defending me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So he made the corrections?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, he made the corrections. I know how people feel. You get an awful
                    thin skin on this stuff, and your problem is that you're out there trying to do
                    something, nobody's getting paid, you're doing these things for the community -
                    it's for your own ego, too; don't let anybody kid you on that one. That has a
                    lot to do with a lot of the things you do. But gee, if you're doing something
                    stupid, go ahead and hit it, but if it's not true, it's not right.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think ego is the whole thing or is an adequate term
                        foit, or what else goes into...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, I think pride, I think ego. One of the things for me was, and going
                    back to the Federal Maritime Commission because Vic Atiyeh was pretty upset, he
                    wanted me to stay in the state and help him, and I said, “Vic, I've got to try
                    it on the national level. I've got to try myself east of the mountains and see
                    if I'm any good on this thing.” I also felt that with fellows like Blake Hering
                    there to advise the Governor, with common sense approaches, that Vic was going
                    to be in very good hands with responsible advice.</p>
                <p>I'd sold a few businesses, and that meant I was in my own mind very free. So I
                    could do it. And this kind of slides into what I think you want to talk about,
                    anyway. I think there's pride. There's patriotism, of course. And power, I
                    suppose; there is power. Boy, there's a lot of power - in a certain very limited
                    degree.</p>
                <p>There's a lot of power if you're elected. Washington, DC is an elected town, and
                    us fellows that come in as appointed - and ladies that come in as appointed,
                    we've got power over industries or something, we might have some say, but we
                    don't have the power that the elected official possesses - and I might add I
                    happen to agree with that because we're not elected there, we can leave when we
                    want to leave.</p>
                <p>But I think a lot of it's ego, too. But it's also a fulfillment of your
                    gratification; it's fun. It's a hell of a lot of fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm just thinking “ego” sometimes is a term that's seen so
                        negatively...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, but everybody's got one. But you're right; it is viewed negatively.
                    I don't view it as a negative thing myself. I think everybody living has got
                    one, whether they know it or not, some people, I know what you're saying, have
                    got a lot of ego that, you know, there's no reason for the ego.</p>
                <p>It's like when you're first, say, the chairman of the Federal Maritime
                    Commission, and you walk into an official meeting or something like that, and
                    everybody in the room stands up. Well, they're standing up for the chairman of
                    the Federal Maritime Commission; they're not standing up for Punch Green. And
                    that's the concept you've got to have. And some of these people never get over
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Separate the personal from the office.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, they can't get over it. It's a role you're playing, anit's fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's get into the story of how you arrived there.
                        Thfirst suggestions of it, the conversations...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, Bob Packwood was the key in that one. You see, the Republicans had
                    just taken over control of the Senate - not the House, the Senate. And also Mark
                    Hatfield played an enormous part in this thing. He was the chairman of the
                    Appropriations Committee, and Bob had the Commerce Committee, which also had the
                    responsibility of all the independent regulatory agencies.</p>
                <p>And I might add at this stage - I mean, here we've a little small agency and
                    things like that, I worried about it, whether it's going to be sunsetted or not,
                    and you know, how important a role do we play? That's always a good question to
                    ask. We can get into that a little bit later.</p>
                <p>But I'd have people like Volker, of the Federal Reserve, was nice to me in the
                    meetings when we had all the chairmen of all the independent regulatory agencies
                    - because I was the only one in the room that was close to Bob Packwood. You
                    know, that's how it works. So Volker was nice to me, anyway, but I think he was
                    a little nicer to me than he needed to be because of that. I don't blame him. I
                    think they call it schmoozing, and that's what I used to do when I sold. And I
                    enjoyed it, recognized it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Packwood came to you and...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, what happened was - this is apparently what happened - they were
                    looking for a chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission. They had a fellow
                    there named Dashbach who was running it. He was a Democrat, and he was the
                    chairman, and his term was running out. It's a five-year term.</p>
                <p>And they were sitting around talking about who should be there, and there was a
                    fellow there that wanted it named Peter Tiege. And he was a commissioner. And he
                    was Republican, I think. There were three Republicans and two Democrats - or
                    depending upon who's got the White House, three and two.</p>
                <p>But anyway, so they were sitting around, and there's a wonderful lawyer - I can't
                    think of his name - a smart guy in Washington, DC who said to Bob, he says, “Why
                    don't you find an Oregonian, and appoint him?”</p>
                <p>Bob said, “That's a fine idea.”</p>
                <p>And then I guess it's kind of the Port of Portland, a businessman. Not a failure,
                    but you know, a businessman that's made enough to be able to afford to go back
                    there, put it that way.</p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>And so anyway, the call came in. And I said, “Well, geez, I don't know.” I've
                    forgotten who made the call. They kind of sound you out type of thing. And my
                    main concern was Joan because I knew that she was very happy living here and
                    that sort of thing, and would she want to do this thing?</p>
                <p>And so I went home and we talked about it. And I said to her - she said, “Do you
                    want to do it?” And I said, “Yes, I do.” I said, “It would fulfill my life, as
                    far as that goes, and I think I could do some good back there. I can certainly
                    do as well as what's back there now.”</p>
                <p>And she said, “Well, let me think about it.”</p>
                <p>So we went to a party that night, and the rumor was out pretty strongly about it.
                    And as I recall I think it was Mort Bishop came up to me at this party and said
                    something to me about it, and I said, “Well, I'm thinking about it. I've got to
                    wait and see.” And I looked over at Joan, and she kind of smiled at me, and she
                    nodded yes. And I said, “Yes, I think I'm going to do it.”</p>
                <p>And so I had to promise her a white Jeep for the White House and mink coat like
                    Nancy Reagan, which I got her both.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was the one behind the white Jeep.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. It was Joanie's white Jeep, and she drove it alaround.</p>
                <p>There's a wonderful story about the white Jeep. I can tell it now. It kind of
                    bounces ahead. Do you want to do it now?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Okay. We were invited to the White House. Those are wonderful - I mean,
                    those are moments that I just treasure. We were invited to the White House for a
                    state dinner; I think it honored the President of Finland. And it was just
                    wonderful. It was under President Reagan.</p>
                <p>I went to the window and I looked out, and under the entryway - I said to Joan,
                    “Come here.” I said, “Joan, look out the window.” All the rented limousines were
                    all around, and there among them was a white Jeep under the center light.</p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>And it was really funny; when we left, everybody left at oncIt was about 11
                    o'clock, and there were a lot of celebrities there, and the Marines were the
                    ones that got the car for us. And this Marine comes up to me, and he says, “Sir,
                    are you the one driving the Jeep?” And I said, “Yes, that's me.” He said, “Would
                    you mind if I get it for you?” And I said, “I'd be delighted.”</p>
                <p>And he drove the Jeep up, and it was really funny. All these people were getting
                    into their chauffeured limousines, and there was kind of a titter went through
                    the crowd when the Jeep came up. And I said in a very loud voice to Joan, I
                    said, “Well, darling, at least this one's paid for.” And off the White House
                    grounds we went.</p>
                <p>But I'll never forget that. That was a wonderful moment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was another time in the white Jeep you bailed
                        somebody ouwho was stuck in the snow, I think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. And the fellow turned out to be...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the heir to a fortune. Borden Gray.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. Borden Gray and I became friends, and Borden was Bush's attorney
                    in the White House. And Borden was stuck in the snow. I didn't know who he was,
                    but where I was living in Georgetown, I knew it was somebody. I didn't know
                    anybody particularly, and there was this guy out there, so yes, I helped him.
                    And Borden was always grateful. Matter of fact, I had lunch with him last time I
                    was in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So about how much lead time are you getting on this? You
                        werconfirmed in March...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Then I had to find a place to live. I stayed at the Sulgrave Club for
                    about six weeks. God, it was wonderful. And then I stayed at the University Club
                    because the Sulgrave Club shut down in the summer. And then Fred Bush, who's no
                    relation to George Bush but is a good friend of mine, his wife became pregnant,
                    and they had to move out of their home, out of this little 1,000 square foot
                    apartment in Georgetown. And I just loved it. It was furnished, it was
                    everything, and it was just room for Joan and me. And it had a garage, even, in
                    that thousand feet.</p>
                <p>So we took it. Joanie came back to see it, and I said, “Honey, it's only going to
                    be for a couple, three years. I just want to get that act passed and all that.
                    I'm not going to stay here five years. Don't worry about it.”</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>So she came back, and I think this is Gerry Frank's favorite remark. Joanie had
                    never paid a great deal of attention to politics, although she's probably the
                    best natural politician I've ever known. But the Bushes gave us a little party
                    in this little apartment we were going to rent. It was about ten people, that
                    was the max. And this fellow that Joanie was sitting next to was going to be a
                    candidate for the Senate from Nebraska. And all of these people around the table
                    were very, very political. That's all they talk about in the beltway is
                    politics. That's their life.</p>
                <p>And there was a lull in the conversation, and Joanie just thought, “Well, I'll
                    add something to it,” and she turned to this fellow, the candidate for the
                    Senate from Nebraska, and says, “And how many senators are there from Nebraska?”
                    And you know, it just broke everybody up.</p>
                <p>That's the one time I was afraid Joanie would back out - going back to the
                    Sulgrave Club that night she said, “I'll never make it here.” I said, “You just
                    stay exactly the way you are; you're exactly what they want.” And it worked out
                    that way.</p>
                <p>But I sent a fellow named Greg Leo back, oh, two or three weeks early. I just put
                    him on my personal payroll, and I said, “Just go back and check this thing out
                    and see.” Because I was getting all sorts of things at my office from this Peter
                    Tiege, who actually turned out to be a pretty nice guy; he just wanted the
                    chairmanship - which is the only job to have, in my opinion, in one of those
                    things. But he was trying to frighten me out of it. He'd send me these huge
                    documents and things, and all I did was throw them out, I didn't even bother to
                    open them. Because I knew how I was going to do it, anyway.</p>
                <p>But anyway, so Greg did a good job on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like a difficult mission for Greg. How did he go
                        abouit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, it was a difficult mission. I mean, what I told him was, I said, “For
                    God's sake, don't act big shot or something” - “I'm representing the Chairman,
                    and you do this and that...” I'm afraid he did a little of that, frankly,
                    because he was too young. He didn't understand quite how it should be done. At
                    the age he is now with the sophistication he has now, he'd be perfect to send
                    back.</p>
                <p>But he didn't do any harm. They weren't used to that being done thaway,
                    anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you know Greg?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: He just moved from the Bush campaign. I liked him, and I knew he was at
                    loose ends, and I asked him how he'd like to go back there. It just seemed like
                    a fairly good idea to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But he was helping you prepare. How else were you
                        preparing foit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, Rusty Johnston - I met Rusty. Bob Packwood is the one that
                    introduced me to Rusty, and he was on Packwood's staff, and it was love at first
                    sight. He was just the guy for me. He was smart and everything, and he had the
                    smarts of Washington, DC better than anybody I've ever met. And I needed it.
                    Boy, I needed that badly.</p>
                <p>And I asked him to stay with me, and we went in to see Packwood, and Packwood let
                    him go with me - because he was pretty key in Packwood's staff, too.</p>
                <p>But anyway, so Rusty helped me. And through the confirmation hearing, of course,
                    I had to prepare - Bob Packwood was the chairman of the confirmation hearing,
                    and Mark Hatfield was the person who spoke on my behalf.</p>
                <p>But you see, what happens is you go in and then you get confirmed as
                    commissioner. Then the President has to appoint you as the chairman. So it's not
                    just - I mean, that was the understanding because I remember saying to Rusty
                    once, I said, “You know, this is an awful lot of work to be chairman.” I said,
                    “Wouldn't it be better just to be a commissioner?”</p>
                <p>And he said, “No, no, you don't want that.” And he was right,absolutely right. So
                    we went through with it.</p>
                <p>Matter of fact, down at the desert I've got the certificatdesignating me
                    chairman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So can you describe the process of getting confirmed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I've done this twice now, once for this and once for the ambassador,
                    and it's the same process. You go around earlier and meet the Senators who are
                    on the committee, and that's Rusty's job, and he took me around. It was kind of
                    fun. We'd go to these hidden offices, you know, where the Senators don't get
                    disturbed; they call them hideaway offices, and they're all over the Senate. You
                    know you've really arrived when you get a hideaway office.</p>
                <p>So that's kind of fun, to meet them in an informal way. And I didn't have any
                    trouble. Slade Gorton was a lot of help to me; he was there at the time. I
                    promised him that I wouldn't take any undue action. I'd treat Seattle just as
                    fairly as I treated Portland. That was his main concern, and I think we covered
                    that a little earlier; we're bouncing around with this thing. But Seattle was
                    worried.</p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>And then Portland came to me and said I'm overdoing it, but I think we covered
                    that. If we want to go back, we can always go back on this sort of thing. I
                    guess we'll have a session like that when we finish this exercise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, some detail may crop up, too, as we go along.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: So anyway. And after you've done that, Rusty had me pretty well programmed
                    in on what questions they'd ask and how I should answer them, really, when it
                    comes right down to it. And that's what I did.</p>
                <p>It's nerve wracking. I'll tell you one funny thing is that then I was presenting
                    the FMC budget, and this was shortly after confirmation, and it's when Sandra
                    Day O'Connor, who went to Stanford at the same time I did, was there. She and I
                    became good friends and are very good friends now, and she's of course on the
                    Supreme Court. And I followed her with our presentation and there were reporters
                    and everybody just packed in there for Justice O'Connor, and she did it, of
                    course, beautifully. And then it was my turn, but everybody left. I asked one of
                    the reporters, with a grin on my face, I said, “Don't you want to hear the
                    Federal Maritime Commission budget?” The guy said, “Are you kidding?” He was out
                    of there.</p>
                <p>So anyway, that was an interesting thing. Hatfield was extremely helpful, and
                    Gerry Frank was just marvelous. It wasn't as if I was after more money or
                    something like that in the budget. As a matter of fact, a lot of times what I
                    was trying to do was save money. But the government's funny on this thing.
                    Supposing you've got a million dollars, and it's still there, you haven't spent
                    it, isn't that good? In private life I'd sure buy a guy a dinner or give him a
                    piece of it or something. But in government, you've got to spend it. If you
                    don't spend it, they'll take it away from you, so you don't have it the next
                    year. And you might need it the next year. I mean, it's crazy. And this happens
                    all over government at the end of the fiscal, and the government's fiscal is
                    September; it isn't year end. So that to me is I think one of the big things
                    that could be quite easily changed - it's really an attitude thing.</p>
                <p>When I got there, there were about 430 employees, which is a small agency, and
                    there were - let's see, we had New York, San Francisco, New Orleans and I think
                    Florida offices. When I left there, we didn't have any of that. We had a New
                    York office, I guess, but we were way down. We were down to about 250 people and
                    getting twice as much done. And I didn't hurt anybody. I didn't fire anybody. It
                    was just attrition. When somebody retired, what I'd do would be to go and talk
                    to, or I'd have my personnel guy talk to them, and I'd find out who was sitting
                    next to him, and if we gave him a new computer with more to it and upgraded him
                    a couple of grades where he would get a little bit more money, this one guy
                    could do two jobs, and it was very easy. So that's how we did it.</p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>I'd have people in my office, the chairman's office, which is a gorgeous office,
                    a huge office with its own lavatory and all that. You know when you've made it
                    in Washington, DC, when you have your own toilet. Next door, of course, a
                    conference room and all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was morale when you walked into the job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: It wasn't good. It was terrible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What signs of that did you see?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, you could see it in the elevator as you went to work. Some of these
                    people had never been in the chairman's office. I couldn't believe it. So I
                    said, “We're going to start doing that; we're going to start bringing them up
                    here, and we're going to start to talk to them.” And we did. We got them all in
                    there, and there were a lot of - you asked me when you and I first met if I'd
                    ever worked with blacks, African-Americans; that's where I got a lot of
                    experience working with African-Americans in Washington, DC. And I'll tell you,
                    we had some fantastic people working for us. And we had some that weren't very
                    good, and we had some WASPs that weren't very good, too.</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact, we had one Judge - I'll never forget this - you can't fire
                    anybody in Washington. If they want to stay on, they can stay on. And this one
                    guy was just terrible, and he was in Bob Bourgoin's section. I can't remember
                    his name, but I do remember I couldn't get rid of him. So I had him in my
                    office, and I had the personnel man - always have a witness when you're in one
                    of these things because it's just smart to have one. “That's not what the
                    Chairman said,” and that sort of thing. They don't call you “Punch,” they call
                    you “Chairman.” And that's kind of fun. That helps you out. You don't like the
                    word “ego,” but it doesn't hurt my relationship with that person at all.</p>
                <p>But anyway, I had this guy in my office, and I said, “You're not going to leave
                    me, are you?” And he said, “No, and there's nothing you can do about it.” I
                    said, “Yes, there is.” And I had checked this out before. I said, “This is a
                    Friday. On Monday you're going in the mail room. You're paid $50,000 a year, but
                    you're going to be a $50,000 mail room clerk, if you want to work down there. I
                    can put you anywhere I want to put you. Or if you come in Monday and say you're
                    leaving, that's fine with me, I'll give you a nice party and we'll say all sorts
                    of nice things about you. Either way you want to play it, and it doesn't make
                    any difference to me.”</p>
                <p>He came in Monday and quit. That's the only way I could get rid of him. And that
                    may sound cruel, but it was necessary and he got his full pension.</p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>Being actually sworn as chairman, I did it over at the agency. I invited
                    everybody that worked for the agency, plus a few others, and Bob Packwood swore
                    me in. And that had them all a-twitter, that the chairman of the Commerce
                    Committee would leave his post and come over and swear me in. That meant a great
                    deal to them, to the people over there. And then I gave them a party which I
                    paid for. I said, “Stick around and let's have a little fun.”</p>
                <p>Joanie was with me, and we just kind of went around and talked to all of them,
                    things like that, so we got that sort of thing going, and we just kept that
                    going. That's what I did with business.</p>
                <p>You asked me things about how you went about changing an agency. When I first got
                    there, they wanted me to go to New York, and I'd been at the F.M.C. about a
                    month. And we'd had our meetings that were public, and the Daily Journal of
                    Commerce is the one that covers the Federal Maritime Commission, and I gave you
                    that nice editorial they wrote when I left.</p>
                <p>And so anyway, I went to New York with Rusty. We were on our way down to this
                    meeting, in this carpeted hall, very fancy, and this guy comes up to me and
                    says, “Well, you're on your honeymoon, and we're going to give you a couple,
                    three months to see how you work out.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I don't know who it was. One of these young guys.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Private sector?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, private sector guy. So I turned to him - I just stopped. I said,
                    “Hold it. Come here a second.” I said, “You don't know much about me, but you
                    know, I can leave this anytime I want. So I'll make you a deal, you give me two
                    or three months, and I'll give you two or three months, too, to come around to
                    thinking the way I do.”</p>
                <p>And boy, it got back to me in about two weeks. My phone rang from a lot of people
                    in the industry saying, “No, he was way out of line saying that to you. We like
                    the way you're doing it,” and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>I used to have the people in from the industry. You know the first question I
                    asked them? I said, “Are you making any money? Are you making a profit?” You
                    can't stay in business without making a profit. Well, that from a government
                    person was unheard of.</p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>“Is it an adequate profit? Is it enough to build a new ship or get the money from
                    the banks to build a new ship and that sort of thing?”So that just relaxed them
                    immediately because that's talking down their line. And I was there to help
                    them. I said, “I'm not there to hurt you. I'm there to help you, all of you. I
                    mean, that includes not only the big boys, but the little guys, the freight
                    forwarders and things like that.”</p>
                <p>And so it just plain worked. I felt very comfortable doing it. AnI had good,
                    competent people in the key roles at the F.M.C.</p>
                <p>And Joanie was now getting into it. We joined Chevy Chase Country Club, and she
                    could play her golf. She went out to a public course for a while before we got
                    in there, and thought nothing of it, and we took some of these real golf pals,
                    and we'd take them out for dinner, and they didn't know what hit them. Joanie
                    just handled it in a natural way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just liked playing golf with all kinds of people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: That's right. And it was very nice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Including four nuns?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, she played golf with some nuns. I'd forgotten that. don't know how
                    you learned that one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She just met them; is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. Just met them on the golf course. And we're Episcopalians, and I
                    said, “Don't have me play a round of golf with them,” because my language is
                    terrible on the golf course.</p>
                <p>I've got a wonderful story to tell you about my secretary iBucharest, but we'll
                    get into that later.</p>
                <p>Q: Okay. The industry people that you're beginning to deal with, they also saw
                    another side of you eventually, didn't they, as Federal Maritime Commissioner?
                    As you worked with them they saw that you had to do your job of regulating, as a
                    regulatory agency. Did they have to kind of adjust to that, too, after they
                    found you were a really nice, approachable guy, did they then also have to think
                    of you as a person who was doing the work of the office?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, I think that was always in the back of their mind.</p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>I think the one I admired the most in the private sector on the American side of
                    it was a fellow by the name of Crowley, who died. As a matter of fact, he
                    married a Portland girl, Molly Murphy, Molly Crowley. Bob Crowley was his name,
                    and he was the smartest, I thought, because he had tugs and he had barges and
                    things like that. The one that founded Sealand - I'm trying to think of his
                    name...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Finnerty?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Finnerty, not quite. He was the one that did containers. I mean, it's
                    fantastic what he did - he modernized the industry. This tale of my life winds
                    itself in and out so. This is all you're doing. I didn't think too about - I
                    thought about the Thursday letter to Mom, and then the rest of it is just the
                    way I've always done something. I have this tunnel vision for success. And the
                    success goal I finally got was the passage of the Shipping Act of 1985. That's
                    where I got working with Elizabeth Dole and all of that.</p>
                <p>Q: It would be really wonderful to go through the story of that Bill, beginning
                    with your first notes that people gave you, the first word that they gave you,
                    Packwood, Gorton and so forth, telling you about the Bill - because it had been
                    going already before, they'd been working on it.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. But the problem with the Maritime that I could see was there
                    isn't any constituency. They've got their little cliques going here and there -
                    including labor. But with Packwood in the position he was in and Hatfield in the
                    position he was in - but particularly Packwood in the Commerce Committee and
                    being head of it, we could move on it.</p>
                <p>I'll tell you an interesting example. One of the big things we got out of the
                    Shipping Act from the agency's standpoint was that we could represent ourselves
                    in court. We didn't have to go to the Justice Department and have the Justice
                    Department represent us. My argument was the FTC, Federal Trade Commission,
                    could represent themselves, why couldn't we? We had very adequate lawyers. We
                    had very good lawyers. I was always amazed by how good lawyers we had at the
                    price we were paying, the government price we were paying.</p>
                <p>But anyway, so I was talking to this guy who was Inouye's number one - Inouye is
                    the Senator from Hawaii - his number one guy. And the Democrats were having an
                    awful time adjusting to the fact they weren't in the majority, and this guy just
                    couldn't believe it. So he called me up once, and he says, “I've kind of given
                    some thought to this, and I don't think you should be able to - I think it would
                    be better if you had to go through the Justice Department rather than going
                    directly to court yourselves.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Well, the FTC has it.”</p>
                <p>“Yes, but we think it's...”</p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>I said, “How long are you going to be there?” And he said, “Well, half an
                    hour.”So I called up Bob Packwood, and I got him right away, and I explained to
                    him what the Aide proposed. He said, “Do you want me to pull the bill?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Would you, if I called you back?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Yes.”</p>
                <p>So I called this guy, and it was really dramatic. I said to him, “You know, I
                    just talked to the chairman, Packwood,” and the guy finally - Oregon - and I
                    said, “If you insist upon this, I'm going to call him back and tell him to pull
                    the bill, and he's going to pull the bill, and we're going to blame you and your
                    Senator totally for this debacle.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Aw, forget it. We're not going to do anything.”</p>
                <p>“You're not going to do a thing?”</p>
                <p>“No, we're not going to do a thing.”</p>
                <p>“All right. Fine.” Called Bob back, and I said, “Let it go.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were dealing with an aide of Inouye, and this would
                        havbeen pretty early in things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: It was about midway. We were ready to go with the neShipping Act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this after Metzenbaum's filibuster had put a stop to
                        it thfirst time around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, I guess so. I've kind of forgotten. Yes, I didn't like Metzenbaum.
                    Oh, God, Metzenbaum!I think the bill - matter of fact, our first general
                    counsel, the one before Bob Bourgoine, Jonathan Benner. Very good man. He said
                    to me, “You know, you change about ten words in the Shipping Act of 1916, and we
                    could work with it.” But they can't - Washington can't work that way. And I
                    said, “Yes, but the ten words wouldn't get us direct to court - take the
                    politics out of it, really, by not going through Justice.” I mean, when you go
                    through Justice, you get into politics. When you go yourself, you're in
                    politics, but it's your politics, to the courts and things like that. And that's
                    a very important thing.</p>
                <p>That's another thing I'd let people do that they just couldn't believe. I said,
                    “You've got to go over to the court. I don't use the car very much” - the
                    chairman had a car. I said, “You use the car and the driver.”</p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>So one guy finally said, “I'm going to take him up on that.” So he did it, came
                    back, and I said, “That's wonderful. That's what it's there for. Use it.”</p>
                <p>So the guys were having the driver - and this guy, the driver, was a marvelous
                    guy. He said, “Is that all right?” I said, “Yes, of course it is. Do it. I want
                    it used.”</p>
                <p>Q: The Justice Department seems to play quite a role here, and you were just
                    saying that it's politicized when it goes through Justice. Can you tell me more
                    about...</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, you've got to go through three or four different people.</p>
                <p>Take for example we had this problem with Gleason, and he was head of the ILA,
                    Tom Gleason. And it dealt with the 50-mile rule and a few things like that. The
                    50-mile rule is - what they were trying to do was get anything within 50 miles
                    of any port has to be handled by an ILA member. Well, that puts almost everybody
                    out of it, except the ILA members - because you go 50 miles outside of New York,
                    and how far are you from Baltimore, and you know - I mean, there go all the
                    little guys. And we wouldn't let it happen. I said, “No, that's just wrong.”</p>
                <p>So we beat them on it, but they threatened a strike, and they went to Justice,
                    and they went everywhere. And the political pressure on us was simply enormous.
                    And I was in Seattle making a speech, and I got into trouble. They made a phone
                    call - I mean, they were expecting maybe an ILA shut-down strike on the East
                    Coast during the election campaign, all because of this little bastard Punch
                    Green and the FMC and his people. “What's the matter with you? Get that
                    straightened out.”</p>
                <p>I said, “No, we're not going to do it.”</p>
                <p>We had a great Democrat on the committee, Tom Moakley - I'm sure I've mentioned
                    him in the notes. Anyway, we came to a stand-down, and I called them all back on
                    a weekend. And one guy who was a Republican was getting a little nervous about
                    it, whether he'd stay - I mean, he was about ready to go off to the commission,
                    anyway. I said, “I'm the guy that's going to get it. But don't worry about this
                    thing.”</p>
                <p>I was plenty worried, but you know, you've got to put on an act. But anyway,
                    Tuesday my phone rang about 8:30 in the morning in the office, and it was this
                    other commissioner, the Democrat, saying, “Mr. Chairman, he blinked.”</p>
                <p>I said, “What do you mean?”</p>
                <p>“He's postponed anything until after Christmas,” which meant aftethe
                    election.</p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>And then there was no strike - that was the end of it. It didn't happen. I tell
                    you, I took a few boys out and I said, “I can't drink, but you drink.” I'll tell
                    you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tom Moakley...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Tom Moakley is the commissioner who called me. And hibrother's a
                    Congressman. You did your homework.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Justice involved in this, the Justice
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, the Justice Department was - I mean, they're not bad people; they're
                    just part of the administration. We're an independent regulatory agency. We're
                    not part of the administration. And a fellow from Justice has to act for the
                    Justice Department - if the President of the United States calls Justice, or you
                    know, somebody like that calls Justice, they've got to react that way because
                    that's where their power comes from - their authority, I should say.</p>
                <p>An independent regulatory agency - like the Federal Reserve, for example, the
                    most famous of all of us, is an independent regulatory agency. So you don't want
                    to go through anybody else.</p>
                <p>That's another thing I told the people. I know I sound like an angel, but it's
                    the way I've always done business. I said to them, “You're free to take
                    chances.” And that would get to a few of them. I said, “That's the way you are
                    in government; I know that.” I said, “Let me make you a deal that I think you'll
                    enjoy. We're going to make some moves here, we're going to do some things, and
                    if they don't work out, you blame it on me. If they do work out, you take the
                    credit. I don't care because I'm going back to Oregon, anyway. It doesn't make
                    any difference.”</p>
                <p>They just loved that sort of thing. And then Bob Bourgoin came up with this kind
                    of “one, two, three, four” idea of his that if it wasn't very important we just
                    whopped it through. If it - when it got down to the fourth category, which we'd
                    get about three or four, involving countries and things like that - and we were
                    supposed to be flag blind - those were important and that's what the Commission
                    was there to do. But the Commission wasn't there to okay a building that they
                    might put on an Oakland dock. That doesn't make much difference, but they had to
                    do it. Oakland had to come to us because that's the law.</p>
                <p>I never will forget when we finally quietly put this new procedure in effect, and
                    Oakland came to us with a building on a dock, and it used to take them four or
                    five months before they'd get an okay from the FMC to go ahead and put the
                    building up. The thing came up on a Monday, and Tuesday it was okay, we'd okayed
                    it. And Oakland, the guy called me and says, “Do you know what you did?” And I
                    said, “Yes. We've changed things here a little bit.”</p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>“Boy, have you changed it!” I mean, they were no more ready to put the building
                    up than the man in the moon because they thought, we'd delay it forever.</p>
                <p>But that was fun, and Bob Bourgoin should get all the credit for that. He was
                    nice enough to tell me he was waiting for a guy to be chairman that he admired
                    before he made that suggestion.</p>
                <p>Q: So all of this sort of thing was not happening before, in the old commission
                    before you arrived, because big changes took place in the whole makeup of the
                    commission?</p>
                <p>GREEN: They were stepping out with me. I can tell because I went back there
                    recently, and the FMC right now is doing very well. But I went in to see the
                    chairman now who's there, and he said some awfully nice things, and there have
                    been a lot of chairman between myself and him.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, that's really an interesting concept. So there were people there who
                    knew the commission and had ideas, and when you came along, they then had the
                    opportunity to go ahead with them.</p>
                <p>GREEN: They had the opportunity to do what they wanted to do.</p>
                <p>Q: And who are the principal people who represent that sort of continuation, who
                    were there in the previous Commission seeing what was needed and through
                    you...</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, there was a Frank Herney, who was the Secretary. He was a marvelous
                    man. I made a mistake; I should have appointed him as the head guy. I appointed
                    Jim Cooper instead. Jim was okay, but he was the old type. He was really pushing
                    me for it, though, and I relented and did it - because I had Rusty, mainly,
                    because I knew I was going to handle it with Rusty, anyway. But Jim was just all
                    aghast when I'd do something in New York or - so finally we just parted ways -
                    it was too bad because he was an awfully nice guy. He's an ex-FBI man. But it
                    just got to him. He knew that things were changing.</p>
                <p>Herney died, but he was just loved. He handled how things came in on the agenda,
                    and I called him up once when Admiral Shearer, who was head of the Maritime
                    Administration, which is part of the Department of Transportation, and he wanted
                    me to do something for China, and we had a regulation, so I called Herney up,
                    and I said, “Frank, we've got something about China coming up,” and he said,
                    “Yes.” And I said, “How far is it away?” We met every week. He said, “Oh, it's
                    about three or four weeks.” I said, “Could you get it up to this week?” He said,
                    “Yes, I can do that.” So he did all that, and we passed it out.</p>
                <p>I went to a party that night, and Admiral Shearer came up to me and he said,
                    “Punch, you did a great thing today.” And I said, “What's that?” This was early
                    on. So he went over and he poured himself a belt, and he went over by the fire,
                    and I said, “Admiral, there's something about me I think you should know.”</p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>He squared his shoulders and he said, “all right, Punch. What is it?”</p>
                <p>I said, “I was a buck private during World War II.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Why, you won the war?”</p>
                <p>That's one of my favorite stories.</p>
                <p>But you know, socializing in Washington, they go after you. You don't have to
                    worry about it. I lost a lot of weight in this job. A lot of it was tension. I
                    lost a lot of weight in Bucharest, too, and a lot of it's tension. But you also
                    don't eat as much because you go to these parties and you might eat a little
                    hors d'oeuvres, but I didn't go out for dinner afterwards. I'd just skip dinner.
                    Joan agreed with me.</p>
                <p>And a lot of times what I'd do would be to - not a lot of times, and I'm not the
                    first one - if I had a guy that had done a really good job or something, I'd
                    give him the invitation to some embassy party or something like that, and I'd
                    say, “Here, sign my name on the register down below and go up there and have
                    yourself a nice time.” That was a nice little perk for them, and I got myself
                    out of having to go and schmooze things. I didn't do it too often because they'd
                    know whether I was there or not. As I got to be known around town. When I was
                    first there I could do it more. But I was at that time bringing the people in to
                    support me in the agency, anyway, so it made it okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it like going around to these social events?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, it isn't any different than anywhere. I mean, you see people you've
                    heard of, let's put it that way, but I mean, you know, they aren't much -
                    really, people aren't much different, Jim. There are good guys and bad guys,
                    good gals and bad gals. I mean, no matter where you are. I've seen the other
                    side of the mountain, and I can tell you there is little difference.</p>
                <p>A lot of people are in Washington and are way up there as a result of tremendous
                    wealth and things of that sort. They had to do something and went into public
                    life. It's not really their abilities; they were born very lucky. And there are
                    other people that vice versa, that are there that, were staffers and went on to
                    become Congressmen, usually, and then Senators.</p>
                <p>But it's an interesting group of people. I'd go to these parties, and you could
                    always tell the recently-deposed Democrat because he'd say that he was a
                    consultant. So you'd say, you know, “What were you doing when the Democrats had
                    control?” if you knew them well enough.</p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>But we made some awfully good friends, from a standpoint of just social, too. And
                    that really was Joanie's job more than mine. I didn't have time for it, but she
                    did. She did a marvelous job of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was she there with you most of the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, most of the time. I was very proud of Joanie's success in Washington.
                    She was a member of the Chevy Chase Garden Club and derived a lot of pleasure
                    from it, and also she joined the Friends of the National Arboretum, she and
                    Nancy Ireland were very active in it and still are, so that's a lasting good
                    memory of Washington, DC, for both of us. She'd come out to the beach in Oregon
                    and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And where were the girls at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Kelsey's Portland, and Carter was in - yes, she was married and she was in
                    Minnesota. And Laddie wasn't married, and she lived in Chicago.</p>
                <p>I remember once then Vice President Bush called and wanted to know if Joan and I
                    would like to go to the theater, the Kennedy Center, with them. And I said,
                    “Well, Joan's out of town. Yes, I'd love to, and my daughter from Chicago would
                    love to come.”</p>
                <p>“Well, she doesn't want to go out with a bunch of middle-aged people,Punch.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Yes, she would, if you wouldn't mind.”</p>
                <p>He said, “No, fine, if she wants to come.”</p>
                <p>So Laddie came up, and she said that's one of the outstanding timeof her
                    life.</p>
                <p>We called Joan at our Oregon beach house from the limousine on the way to the
                    Kennedy Center, and there are only two of these telephones in the world: one in
                    the President's car and one in the Vice President's car. So it goes right
                    through, and Joanie was at the beach. And Joanie answered the phone, and the
                    Vice President said, “Joan, this is George Bush.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, come on,” and she hung right up.</p>
                <p>He said, “That happens to me all the time.”</p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>But we had some marvelous times. There was a Christmas event that we spent at the
                    Vice President's home, and it was snowing, and the carolers and the setting -
                    you know, those are the times that make some of these very trying times that you
                    have in DC, just make the whole thing worthwhile. It's just beautiful.</p>
                <p>But I never wanted to live there on a permanent basis. I want tlive where I'm
                    living, in Oregon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who else were you socializing with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, we had a Congressman who lived right behind us named Andy Ireland
                    from Florida, and Nancy Ireland. And Nancy and Joanie still are still very close
                    friends - they're coming out, as a matter of fact, they're visiting us..</p>
                <p>Then we had Mary Bowman, who is a relative of Cy Walker of Portland. He used to
                    be head of Pope &amp; Talbot, and she opened a lot of doors for us. Then we had
                    Patsy Pope who lived in DC at the time, married to this fellow, and he got us
                    into Chevy Chase and that type of thing.</p>
                <p>And Reese Taylor and I went to Stanford together, and he was head othe ICC, the
                    Interstate Commerce Commission.</p>
                <p>You know, it wasn't very difficult to get - people in Washington's attitudes are
                    different than they are in Portland or elsewhere. It's such a transitory thing.
                    There's an awful lot of nice people moving in with each administration and
                    moving out. And it's sad. A lot of people in Washington, DC don't want to get
                    that close to you because they know they aren't going to see you after three or
                    four years.</p>
                <p>And I got some beautiful letters from some people when we left. But it's also
                    easy to get acquainted with new people because they're new, too. And I've kept
                    my membership in the Metropolitan Club and in the Sulgrave Club because they're
                    wonderful places to use when Joanie and I visit Washington, DC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You set up some kind of an organization - was it you who
                        set iup? - the CIPA, of heads of regulatory agencies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, Reese and I set that up. All of us, we'd meet for breakfast once a
                    month, and we had a lot of us - Volker never came, but a lot of us who were the
                    chairmen of the independent regulatory agencies, and we'd meet for breakfast in
                    Georgetown at the Four Seasons Hotel, and we'd just talk about common
                    problems.</p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>Once we met with President Reagan. He heard about it and liked the idea, so we
                    met with him, just told him - you know, we never discussed anything because with
                    all the very legal subjects we had to keep it very confidential.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean you didn't get into any legal stuff going
                        oindividually?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, no. You can't do that. But you do have common problems: personnel
                    problems, “How did you settle that,” and that sort of thing, or “I read about
                    you in the paper and that you've got this problem; how are you coming with it,”
                    and that sort of thing. I mean, you'd get a lot of information so that you could
                    avoid doing those sort of things, and you'd get as much advice out of it as you
                    could.</p>
                <p>They listened to me very carefully, mainly because of Packwood - because he could
                    make their life miserable for them, or he could make their life very nice for
                    them. He had some problems with Reese, but we tried to get that straightened
                    out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, just personal. I think it was just a personality - thchemistry wasn't
                    there. It happens all the time.</p>
                <p>But yes, we had that. I'd forgotten that. And we were fairly regular about it. I
                    remember once when we were there that people saw four or five of us at
                    breakfast, and they were kind of impressed by who was there. Mark Fowler,
                    chairman of communication, radios and television, movies and all that.</p>
                <p>But anyway, we got acquainted, and we had interesting times. I thinwe did the
                    right thing.</p>
                <p>Q: Your advice to your successor: in it you mentioned these meetings, and you
                    pointed out that chairmen who didn't have a personal relationship with their
                    individual commissioners would have a bad situation to deal with. It seemed that
                    you did have good relationships with your commissioners, but the others didn't.
                    Was that what you were finding?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, yes, they didn't understand it. It's just a personathing. People
                    want to be treated decently.</p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>You see, a commissioner - and this applies to any of them - has got to be
                    assigned by the chairman to do something, or he just comes in and reads the
                    paper and - I mean, you can sit there and read all day the stuff, if you want,
                    and get nothing done. I had everything briefed for me and just redlined. I said,
                    “I'll spend maybe half an hour or an hour a day on this stuff, but we've got too
                    much to do, I can't read all that stuff.”</p>
                <p>But I tried to keep my commissioners busy by giving them something to do,
                    something to think about. And another thing we'd do - I guess I can say this now
                    - I really controlled it, just totally. But every once in a while I thought it
                    was a good idea if the Democrats won one - but you couldn't let it happen very
                    often because they'd pick it up. “Green doesn't have the control anymore that we
                    thought he had.” So I'd say to Rusty, “All right, let's tighten this thing up
                    now.” So we'd tighten it up for quite a while.</p>
                <p>But they went along. Tom Moakley was a lot of help to me, and the other guys were
                    great. The Republicans were very good; I'm trying to think of their names
                    now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I wrote them down. Jim Day was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Jim Day was an older man, and he was a very nice - he'd beein politics for
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then Jim Carey from Chicago.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Jim Carey was a marvelous guy. And he wanted to be chairmaso badly after I
                    left, but it just wasn't to be, I guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then this was a later arrival, Robert Setrakian.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes, Bob Setrakian. Yes, he was very difficult, to puit mildly. I see
                    him occasionally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Difficult in what way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, he didn't like the role of a commissioner. He misunderstood it. He
                    was used to running his own shop, and you know, he'd raise a lot of fuss if he
                    wanted to make things difficult, he could. Or he can get along. Bob knew that he
                    wasn't going to be the chairman, and he had a very unfortunate thing, he had
                    polio when he was young, so he didn't have the use of his arms. But he also had
                    an ability on the stage and so on; he had a lot of talent that way. But Bob
                    Setrakian and I crossed more than once.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would be the issues within the commission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: He'd want to do things himself without bringing the rest of the commission
                    along. He got a nice write up in the Washington Post about his physical
                    condition and how he'd risen above it and what his position was and things like
                    that, and it was well deserved. But I think it kind of went to his head a little
                    bit. I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm having a hard time envisioning what sort of initiative
                        thahe would do. Was there any example?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I'm trying to remember what the one thing was that really sent us up
                    a tree, and I can't remember it now. But it was really something that he just
                    wanted to do something - I'm sorry, I just don't remember. It's probably
                    referred to somewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's get into Dashbach and the Kehoe affair. What was
                        Dashbaclike? He was a commissioner and had been chairman.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, he was chairman of the commission when I came aboard. He was not a
                    popular man, and the staff didn't like him. I don't know; I never had to deal
                    that much with him because when I moved in, he was out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But he remained on the commission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, he remained on the commission but he was up in NeHampshire most of
                    the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, he was away much of the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like just on the face of it a difficult
                        situation.Here's the old chairman, now stepped down.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. Well, it was, occasionally. You know, because you're being paid - in
                    those days, the chairman got $50,500 and the commissioners get $50,000 or
                    something like that. The money is a very small difference between what you get.
                    As chairman it's the power to move on things that makes it fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what was going on with the Drew Lewis thing and the
                        BriaKehoe threat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, Kehoe used to be at the commission, apparently, in the general
                    counsel's office, and then he moved to the Maritime Administration under the
                    Department of Transportation. This is when Drew Lewis was really riding high in
                    Washington, DC.</p>
                <p>You remember the strike of the air traffic controllers? That's under the
                    Department of Transportation, and the administration won it. And Drew Lewis was
                    a very powerful man in Washington, DC at that time.</p>
                <p>Then I was told by a few people at the commission that if Kehoe came back they
                    were resigning, and they were key people. I said, “What's the matter with him?”
                    And there were a lot of things said. I don't want that in here because it's
                    rumor as far as I'm concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: People on your staff didn't like him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. Well, throughout the agency. And you know, commissioner that the
                    staff fights is a liability.</p>
                <p>So I made an appointment with Drew Lewis and went over with Rusty and explained
                    the situation to him. And I thought it was all taken care of, and I felt pretty
                    good about it and left, and I understand in ten minutes he was on the phone to
                    other people advocating this thing.</p>
                <p>I noticed that Drew had a drinking problem after he left DC because that was in
                    the papers, so that could explain some of it, and I can be sympathetic. It
                    certainly wasn't evident to me, I can tell you that. I see him occasionally.
                    We're okay now, but we're never going to be close friends, I don't think. That's
                    okay.</p>
                <p>I remember once - I think it was the Shipping Act, and they had a White House
                    meeting. It was Drew and the Attorney General and all sorts of people. It had to
                    do with a monopoly situation that shipping lines have to have in order to
                    compete, and the rules are so different than they are in, say, domestic
                    commerce. But the only person they'd talk to would be me. They wouldn't let
                    anyone accompany me - I said, “What about me bringing an aide with me to help me
                    with the question?” “No, just you.”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Because Lewis was running it. I handled it. I was all right in it. I joked
                    with them, too, you know, and got them laughing. But it worked. It was just
                    unfortunate, but they finally dropped it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What made them finally drop it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I can tell you one thing. I remember once - I couldn't believe this
                    - I remember once I was at a party and Drew was there, and he said that he was
                    going to bring it up to Hatfield.</p>
                <p>I said, “Mark Hatfield?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Yes.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, that's a good idea. Why don't you do that?”</p>
                <p>So I just got on the phone just immediately and talked to Mark, and he said,
                    “I'll take care of that when that comes.” So finally Drew put together Oregon
                    and Packwood and Hatfield. He needed Hatfield and Packwood just as much as I
                    did, you know, and he dropped it fast.</p>
                <p>But it was an unfortunate thing. I don't know how it got started. I didn't start
                    it. All I did was respond to the people who I had that I admired that we were
                    finally all working together towards getting the Shipping Act of 1985 through,
                    and here I've got this stuff thrown at me that could have thrown a real wrench
                    into it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what was their purpose overall, do you think, in
                        trying tget Kehoe established there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I don't know. I really don't know. Show a little power. Maybe “This guy
                    think he's pretty good, this guy Green, and let's show him a little something.”
                    I mean, I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, Rusty said the same thing. He said, “I don't
                        know.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Did he? Isn't that interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. He said, “I haven't got it figured out.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>GREEN: No. We haven't spent - well, we've been busy since. I knew Kehoe was very
                    bitter about it, but that's okay, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in imagining things I was beginning to think does
                        this somehow tie into sort of the ideological situation? You've mentioned
                        the purists a number of times at the White House, and they were a factor in
                        this. I wonder if you could describe what was going on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Could be, but you know, we were such a small agency, such small potatoes,
                    that it couldn't have been a big thing. I mean, they all got very nervous when
                    they thought there might be a strike and our agency would be the cause of it
                    during the campaign, when Reagan was up for reelection. You know, it would have
                    been very difficult for the F.M.C.</p>
                <p>Q: You sent a note over to Reagan, to his office, saying, “He's about to make a
                    speech to the Longshoremen. You'd better pay attention to that fact that the
                    fat's in the fire on the 50-mile rule.”</p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, I guess I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know what they did about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I don't think they did anything. It just happened. Maybe somebody got to
                    Gleason; I don't know. Somebody might have talked to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, in the meantime. Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: As I sit here talking right now. that's possible that coulhave
                    happened.</p>
                <p>Q: But I wanted to open it into the larger question of the fact that at the White
                    House there were these people, and I'd like to know who they were and what their
                    thinking was.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I mean, you've got Ed Meece and that sort of thing, but it got to
                    where Ed Meece and I became very good friends, and I could talk to him very
                    easily.</p>
                <p>You know, once you get into these things and you get a subject matter, it doesn't
                    make much difference if you're far right or far left, you can usually get the
                    subject matter taken care of. And that's what I had. I didn't have the
                    electorate to worry about. I wanted to get a replacement for the Shipping Act of
                    1916; I wanted to get it replaced so that the United States would have a modern
                    regulatory body. Well, there's nothing the matter with that - it's
                    bipartisan.</p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>And then it takes about six or eight months to get it in place, and I stayed for
                    that. And that's when I decided to leave, after the Act was finally in
                    place.</p>
                <p>But sure, there were - on that one at the White House, that was a purist move, I
                    think, because I talked to Jim Baker - Jim Baker said, “Are they out to get you?
                    Are you having a tough time?” He was at that time number one to Reagan.</p>
                <p>And at some point I said, “Yes, I'm going over there.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of an idea did you have of the purists in your
                        owmind? What did you make of them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I just avoided them. I didn't pay much attention. I had my little
                    world, and if they were trying to rock it, fine, we'll go after them on that one
                    thing, but the rest of it I didn't even bother with them. I didn't read the
                    Washington Post. I read the Wall Street Journal and the Daily Journal of
                    Commerce. I just wasn't interested. The far right or far left have never
                    interested me. I don't like them. I don't like purists on either side. I never
                    have. They don't get anything done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were making a point of tariffs; they didn't want
                        tariffs.Why? That seems kind of extreme.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, no. You've got to have tariffs, but - who was making point of not
                    wanting tariffs?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The purists in the White House giving you trouble.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, there's a good example. There's a good example. Yes.That's
                    government interference or something.</p>
                <p>You've got to have tariffs. I mean, that's the most favored nation, that's what
                    the thing's all about. You know, with China every year they go through this
                    thing.</p>
                <p>But I remember when we had the Japanese, and we had the law and we'd finally
                    gotten it. So Rusty and I went to Japan to explain it to them - no, this is what
                    we did. I said, “Rusty, we'll go to Tokyo, and we'll let all the people in Asia,
                    all the people around that area know that we're in Tokyo, and let them come to
                    see us. That will save everybody a lot of money. That will save us a lot of
                    money, and we've got it all right there.”</p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>So we did. For about a week, week and a half we were staying at a nice hotel and
                    met with these people. That's how I met the fellow that's running Hong Kong now,
                    C. H. Tung - at least I think - I might have met him before. But anyway, the
                    Japanese were very nervous about the Shipping Act because they'd had it - they
                    didn't like any change, and they had a very good deal going.</p>
                <p>As I say, we have to be flag blind, and a lot of people didn't understand that.
                    And I had a tough time with it. When we made a decision, it couldn't be because
                    it was American; it had to be what they called flag blind, the credibility of
                    the independence of the commission. So that was tough for me to get because I
                    said, “Well, you know, we're the United States Federal Maritime Commission.”</p>
                <p>But what you've got to think about are the consumers that are there and the price
                    that they're paying. And then it starts to make sense to you, as far as you have
                    to be flag blind because otherwise - you know, it doesn't work any other way.
                    But that took a little while for me to get it.</p>

                <p>Dupont was a good example. They were trying to work some things, anwe had to slap
                    them down a little bit.</p>

                <p>GREEN: Yes.</p>
                <p>Q: They wanted to be able to have the kind of contracts that they want - I'm not
                    sure what that would be - so that they could do their bulk trading. So what was
                    the problem with their demands?</p>
                <p>GREEN: I don't know. I've forgotten. I saw it in your notes, and really can't
                    remember. I mean, they're a huge trader.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went to Japan there was also the issue of the
                        high cubcontainers. That sounds really interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. That was something.The American Chamber of Commerce in Tokyo, so
                    I made a speech about - is it high cube?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: High cube containers. Six by nine.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. And the Japanese wouldn't admit - because they wouldn't get under
                    their bridges, they were saying, and all these excuses. And so I very gently
                    reminded them that the high cube containers were manufactured in Japan and sold
                    to us. And I said, “Unless they're all manufactured right at sea level in your
                    marvelous country, I just don't see how...” Anyway, that one got dropped. We got
                    the high cube containers taken care of.</p>
                <p>The Japanese were funny. They had about six or seven people, all very powerful in
                    Japan representing various companies at a meeting. And all six of them were
                    extremely courteous to Rusty and myself. But this one guy, he was elected to be
                    the bad cop. I mean, you could just tell it. I had a hell of a time keeping a
                    straight face in the whole thing. I like a good argument, particularly if I
                    think I'm right and I think I'm doing it for this country. That gives me a great
                    feeling. I'll take anybody on.</p>
                <p>Q: It sounds like a really provocative and very un-Japanese thing to do, to say
                    something that forward, to put them on the spot with the fact that they are
                    manufacturing these things. Did anybody say, “Hey, I'm not sure I would do
                    that”?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. The Chamber of Commerce guys came up to me, and one guy said,
                    “I've been over here for 20 years, and I've been waiting for a speech like
                    that.”</p>
                <p>I said, “I don't know. Think I can get out of here tomorrow?”</p>
                <p>Q: Well, how is it that the Japanese came around? Because they had to put a huge
                    capital outlay to respond to that, and they did, they had to put up a lot of
                    money to convert.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, that's what they didn't want to do. What we did. It's just part of
                    it. I mean, look at all these things that are going on. You just have to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It succeeded because they had to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Sure. I mean, it's modern - you've got to drag some people kicking and
                    screaming. They've got a good deal the way it is, and they don't want to change
                    it.</p>

                <p>Q: I was also interested in your writing about you were telling your Mom, “I'm
                    going to go down to Sealand, and I'm going to give these people a piece of my
                    mind.” This was fairly early in your stay at the agency.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. We had a very good meeting. What was that about? Theall were there,
                    all of Sealand's management.</p>
                <p>You see, nobody had ever gotten out and talked to them from thFederal Maritime
                    Commission.</p>
                <p>I can't remember what the issue was; I'm sorry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They're a big player.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. The fellow that established Sealand is the one that developed
                    containers. He used to be in the trucking business. That's where he got the
                    concept. Now everything's container. Brilliant man. I'm trying to think of his
                    name, too. They just slip by. Senior memory. Excuse me. I'm seventy-four; it
                    shows every once in a while.</p>
                <p>Q: One of your critics, a guy by the name of Robert Pouch [?], said that this
                    bill - you know, after it was passed he said, “The problem with this bill is
                    that it's too full of compromises. The original purpose that they had in
                    creating this new bill was really good and right on the mark, but all the
                    compromises that they've had to make creates a bill that's,” he said, “just
                    about the same as the bill of 1916,” which might have been quite an
                    exaggeration. But what about this idea of compromises? Did you worry about
                    that?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, there were compromises, there's no question. You have to give
                    something to get something. That's how you get things done in Washington, DC. I
                    didn't think they were that bad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were some of the compromises worrisome?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No. I mean, I had certain things that I definitely would not give on. One
                    was our ability to represent ourselves in court. As far as I was concerned, that
                    was the number one thing. And also recognizing you've got containers now, and
                    bulk cargo is no longer used to a great extent. I mean, it's not an important
                    factor.</p>
                <p>There were certain things, I guess, on the niceties of the law that maybe could
                    be stronger; and I think they're working on it now, as a matter of fact, to firm
                    it up a little bit more.</p>
                <pb facs="0173" n="Page0173"/>
                <p>Oh, yes. Well, you've got to get your criticisms, and I suppose to a degree it's
                    right. It's always easy when you're on the outside looking in and you don't have
                    the responsibility.</p>
                <p>Q: Most of his assessment was pretty favorable, really, in the end. It kind of
                    surprised me; he then swung around and said a lot of great things about it.</p>
                <p>When the bill was passed and done with and you were writing up the regulations
                    and so forth, you were finishing the work, what worries did you have in your
                    mind about what could go wrong with this bill, as it worked out?</p>
                <p>GREEN: I didn't have any particular worries. I knew it was a lot better situation
                    than it was before. And I also was starting to think about my own future at that
                    time, and Rusty and I had talked about it, and I had talked to a few of the
                    other people I was close to. And I said, “After this, there's not going to be
                    much reason for me being around. I'll stay around, of course, until the bill
                    becomes a law, officially.” And that's when I went over to see Vice President
                    Bush, and that's when he and I talked and I said, “I'd like to handle your '88
                    campaign in Oregon if you want me to.”</p>
                <p>He was interested, and he said, “What do you want?”</p>
                <p>I said, “I want you to be a good President.”</p>
                <p>He said, “No, no. What do you want?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Why don't you make me ambassador to an interesting country?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, perhaps that could be arranged.” That's exactly whahe said.</p>
                <p>So then I went back, and boy, they, the Reagan people, were just delighted to
                    have the opening because this is level three job. So you know, it's a pretty
                    high opening, and nobody could believe I was leaving. I mean, it was the
                    cushiest job in town - because the only thing I could see that there was to do
                    was to get the tariffs computerized, but really I'd have nothing to input
                    there.The toughest thing I had to do was talking Joanie into the move because
                    she was loving Washington, DC. I said to myself - what goes around comes
                    around.</p>
                <p>I wasn't too concerned. I suppose there were - really Rusty and Bob Bourgoin were
                    the two that wrestled the law through. That was lawyers' work getting that stuff
                    done. I could get them that far. I could get them financed mainly because of my
                    friendships with Hatfield and Packwood.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Gerry Frank help you? What did he actually
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>GREEN: Well, he was number one to Hatfield. And you know, sometimes I'd have
                    problems with the budget, sometimes I'd have problems with people, and sometimes
                    I'd have problems with how do I get this done, how do I get that done. And I'd
                    just call - after all, I've known him all my life. And he always responded. Even
                    when he was out of town he'd call, and I'd say, “Where are you?” and he'd say,
                    “Los Angeles.” I'd say, “Well, you didn't have to call me.” He'd say, “Wait five
                    minutes and call a staff man,” and whom to call. So I'd call, and usually the
                    problem would be taken care of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he helped a lot with the budget?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: He helped somewhat with the budget, sure. I mean, if we had a
                    misunderstanding or something like that, yes. I mean, you can't do it on a
                    dollar-and-a-half, you know. It's got to be done - we didn't try to raise the
                    budget particularly. What we tried to do was just protect the darn thing.
                    Because we had less people, and so we had less payroll, and we had less outside
                    offices, but still - they could cut us a little bit; I let them cut it. We had
                    less budget. But you know, these guys, most of them never met a payroll, and
                    they don't have any idea what it's all about.</p>
                <p>So yes, Gerry was an immense help when I needed somebody from whom I could get a
                    sympathetic ear. A staffer, that's who I needed. I didn't need to talk to a
                    Senator. I learned that quickly enough, you talk to the right staffer. It's fine
                    if you know the Senator, you know the Congressman, but it's also very fine if
                    you know the staffer. I always felt that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got rid of the responsibility for petroleum
                        spills.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. You know, Helen Bentley was the chairman of the Federal Maritime
                    Commission under Nixon. They were very proud of a woman being that high in the
                    administration. That was the highest, at that time, that any woman had been in
                    any administration. And she wanted more power, so she went after this oil spill
                    thing or whatever it was, where every ship of 3,000 tons or more had to have a
                    notice from the Federal Maritime Commission that they were in compliance, and
                    the Coast Guard could board them and see, and we had to keep a person on
                    Saturdays and Sundays, 24 hours a day, waiting for one phone call every two
                    weeks or something.</p>
                <p>And I was fiddling around with this little problem, and I said, “Why do we want
                    it? Why not give it away to the Navy or the Coast Guard or whoever? Then we rid
                    ourselves of about 20 people. And also, it's just kind of silly.”</p>
                <pb facs="0175" n="Page0175"/>
                <p>So we did that. I mean, we went about it - and as matter of fact, the Washington
                    Post wrote us up because we were one of the few agencies that had ever
                    voluntarily given up power. But that's why we did that.</p>
                <p>Who did we give it to? Was it the Coast Guard?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the Coast Guard eventually got it, but it went

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Where did it go first? Because we were pretty careful abouthe people we
                    gave them, and we got rid of an awful lot of people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Maritime Administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: It might have been the Maritime Administration. It might have been them.
                    But they got two people who were damn good; I mean, they knew what was going
                    on.</p>
                <p>I got rid of the one guy that every time I was riding in the elevator and he was
                    on it, he'd hit me up for a raise. I said, “Put him in that group fast.” Oh,
                    boy.</p>
                <p>And one poor lady, she couldn't - she didn't even know where she was,. She
                    shouldn't have even been there. She kept coming back to our office, you know.
                    Matter of fact, once I used the car, as I recall, and said, “Jim,” my driver,
                    “just this once take her over there.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was in shock from the transition?</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's part of life in Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, but it's tough when you're - you know, you've got trealize people are
                    human.</p>
                <p>Q: Isn't it ironic that you're faced with the sunsetting movement and there's
                    this talk in the administration of sunsetting all the regulatory agencies? There
                    seemed to be a drive to do that sort of thing. I don't know if this man was part
                    of it, but Rusty mentioned Jim Miller and said he was kind of a factor in
                    things.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. Jim was the candidate for the Senate. Who did he ruagainst? He's been
                    very active. What did he say...</p>
                <pb facs="0176" n="Page0176"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Office of Budget and Management.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: That's right. Yes, he was the Office of Budget and Management. And the
                    funny thing about it is that the Federal Maritime Commission is still there; ICC
                    is no longer there. There are a few of them that have left, which surprises me.
                    And the F.M.C. has done an awfully good job. They've got a very strong chairman
                    now, Harold J. Creel, Jr.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you rationalize this for people when they said, you know, “It's the
                    philosophy of this administration to deregulate and so forth...</p>
                <p>GREEN: I didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...so the FMC should be one of the ones to go?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I didn't rationalize it. I said, “That's fine. Sunset us. But who's going
                    to do it? What are you going to do with the people? I mean, as far as that goes,
                    they know what they're doing on it. Give us something modern, and we'll do
                    something for you. We're not going to interfere. But go ahead.”</p>
                <p>And I said to this one guy - I'll never forget, we were over there talking about
                    the budget. You're constantly talking about the budget to these people in the
                    administration. And I'd take our comptroller, who was good, and I'd say to them
                    when we got over there, once just out of exasperation I was talking to this one
                    guy over in the administration, and I said, “Why don't you cut us down to a
                    dollar-and-a-half? Just forget it. Just knock us out of there. The government's
                    not going to fall because we're not here.”He said, “Well, I don't mean
                    that.”</p>
                <p>I said, “I know, but we are performing a function which is very necessary, but I
                    can tell you one thing, the function has to be modernized. Then you'll really
                    have something good, and something that will help the people of this country,
                    not hurt them. Help them.”</p>
                <p>And you know, it was politics. And also we had - don't forget we had Hatfield and
                    Packwood. Never forget that; you've got them on your side. And that's
                    everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of dealings did you have with Jim Miller?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Jim and I became very good friends. I didn't have anproblem with him.</p>
                <pb facs="0177" n="Page0177"/>
                <p>He went from - he was the chairman of a regulatory agency before hwent to OMB, so
                    he knew what the problems were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So I was getting at an impression of what he really
                        represented,whether he was an ideologue or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, he'd be an ideologue; I suppose he would be, yes. Yes, Jim would be.
                    I think he ran against Oliver North, though, and was defeated.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, then Packwood follows up, and he introduces legislation to meld several
                    agencies into one single regulatory agency. Was this some kind of strategy to
                    deflate the - what was he trying to do?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, it was probably a good idea. Was it when I was there?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and I didn't see signs of it getting very far. GREEN:
                        I don't think it went very far.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Q: Now, during this time you are observing the administration of Reagan, and I
                    wonder if you could give a picture of being there, seeing Reagan go through his
                    presidency - and he went through the assassination attempt...</p>
                <p>GREEN: I wasn't there at that time. That was after I'd left.</p>
                <p>Q: Oh, okay. When you were there he went to Bittburg, Germany, and that's where
                    he really began to slip. His administration began to really get into trouble,
                    and it was after that that Howard Baker was brought in to cleanse the White
                    House of some of its worst ideologues, if you will.</p>
                <p>GREEN: I think that was after me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was after you left.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I think so because Jim Baker was there as the number one, anthen he went
                    to Treasury.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and he was really the moderate.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0178" n="Page0178"/>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. He was a Bush guy. We were all Bush-ites. All Bush-ites were
                    level three; I don't think any of us got above level three, except Baker, Jim
                    Baker. He was a moderate, I suppose, though I've been chewed out by him, and he
                    didn't sound very moderate to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, you've been chewed out by Jim Baker?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. We'll get to that with Romania when he waSecretary of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh. Well, I'll be glad to hear that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I'm going to ask him sometime; I really don't know why thhell he did.</p>
                <p>Q: We'll make a note of that. So can you describe the situation, then, of the
                    Bush-ites? Are you leading a dangerous life being a Bush-ite?</p>
                <p>GREEN: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is going on in this dialogue or maneuvering?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, we all knew who we were. I mean, we'd go to parties and things. We
                    knew who we were. We knew the people who were Reagan all the way. But we got
                    along. We all had a kind of common ground. With all politicians, loyalty has got
                    to be a very, very important factor with you. I mean, I wasn't with Reagan, you
                    see. I joined after Bush was defeated in Oregon when he ran against him for
                    President. I knew he wasn't going to beat Reagan, but I liked the Bush people
                    more than I liked the Reagan people. My moderate philosophy, as I like to call
                    it.</p>
                <p>But I met President Reagan several times when I was there, and he's one of the
                    world's great salesmen. He's got a smile that will knock you dead. But I was
                    never close to him. I'll never feel close to a President like I am to George
                    Bush, as far as that goes. It was a unique experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you thinking of Reagan as you were around
                        him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, you know, he's a lot brighter than a lot of people thought. He knew
                    how to let people run the thing, and he didn't get too uptight.</p>
                <pb facs="0179" n="Page0179"/>
                <p>I asked Ed Meece once, I said, “How do you stand it?” The papers were just all
                    over Ed. And he said, “Well, I know there's an end to it.” That's one thing
                    about it: When they hit you hard on everything, and they were hitting Ed on
                    everything - and he would, I suppose, be considered an ideologue - but there is
                    an end to this stuff. It's just amazing now, for example, you mentioned Howard
                    Baker or Sam Nunn, you don't read about them now. But when you're there, you're
                    there.</p>
                <p>But when you leave - and this is why a lot of people can't leave - it's whoever's
                    there now, who takes the place. That's what people can't get through their head,
                    and that's why people are so afraid to leave because a lot of them were nothing
                    when they got to Washington, became something as a result of this, and
                    particularly if they were elected, many weren't exactly successful people in the
                    world, and they got a staff and everything else, and everybody's catering to
                    them. They wouldn't leave this for anything in the world. And that is what is
                    one of the problems, I suppose, but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's part of the scene.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: It's part of it. And it works. I mean, whether people likit or not, the
                    damn thing does work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wanted to ask you something about the need for the right
                        to seup conferences for inter-modal [?] service. Why was that
                        difficult?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Because it was change. That's probably why it was difficult. Any time you
                    have a change - and there are many people; some people are hurt by change, and
                    some people are helped by change. But any time you have change, people kind of
                    resist. The Japanese are a good example of that. If it's going their way, then
                    they'll be all for it - that's a human nature thing, too.</p>
                <p>You're bringing up things that happened 20 years ago. Inter-modawas a big
                    factor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess one of the problems was this whole idea of
                        grantinantitrust immunity.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, that was a lot of the thing when I went over to the White House -
                    Martin Feldstein, who's at Harvard now, was in the Cabinet. And he's a great
                    free-trader.</p>
                <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                <p>And I said, “Well, it all works fine. I am, too. But you've got to have antitrust
                    immunity. I know it sounds terrible, but I wish I could find some other words
                    for it, but you've got to have it because you've got an international thing,
                    you've got these huge cartels, and they've got the rules on their side, the
                    other countries. They don't have this thing. Our people are just out of it
                    unless they're granted some sort of protection. Otherwise, it's a mess.”</p>
                <p>And he went along with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's an economist, Martin Feldstein...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: It was Martin Feldstein. He is a brilliant economist. Actually, he ended
                    up, I think, agreeing with me. He said, “Maybe you're right,” and he threw his
                    hands up at the meeting. And Lewis went, “Oh...”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it sounds kind of common sense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, sure. That's what everything is, really.</p>
                <p>Q: The foreign competition is using rebates, and then they also mentioned
                    fighting ships. So I know what rebates are, secret deals. Fighting ships I
                    didn't...</p>
                <p>GREEN: I don't know. I can't recall. I suppose it's something that they just put
                    out there free or something like that. It's not a battleship, if that's what
                    you're thinking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Heritage Foundation was weighing in on this sort of

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, they didn't have much influence on us. The Heritage Foundation - you
                    see, when you're chairman of an independent agency they've got to be awful
                    careful how they handle you. I mean, Elizabeth Dole stepped in when the Reagan
                    people were getting pretty uptight because she at one time was chairman of an
                    independent regulatory agency - I think under Reagan or Ford, as a matter of
                    fact. Yes, she was, before she went to the Department of Transportation. She
                    stepped in and said, “Just leave them alone. You don't want to get in that.
                    That's part of his job.”</p>

                <p>GREEN: Yes. Very favorable impression. I like her very much. I like George W.
                    Bush better, but I'd love to see her on the ticket. I like her husband, too,
                    very much.</p>

                <p>Q: Rusty was saying that we should really describe the signing event, March 1984,
                    going through that ceremony. He said it was just such a great moment, I think is
                    probably his thinking.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, it was a great moment.</p>
                <p>The President - you can see how I'm placed, I'm right behind him. There's
                    Elizabeth Dole, and there's Admiral Shearer. There's Slade Gorton. Congressman
                    Biaggi, who went to jail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, that's the guy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. Oh, he's a wonderful man. He was the most decorated policeman in New
                    York's history. I don't know what he did. I guess it involved money. Anyway, he
                    was a great guy to me. He was a Democrat. And then Congressman Smith there. He
                    died. I felt sorry about it; he was a wonderful man.</p>
                <p>But yes, when the President of the United States says “Punch Green” and you don't
                    know the President very well, it impresses you. It makes the time worthwhile.
                    And you know, you've got your name where you stand, it's all down there printed
                    on the floor. And they put my name right there, right behind him.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, relief, and you know, I was happy for all of us that it was finally
                    done. I was surprised to know that there was a lot more work that the commission
                    had to do in order to make the law into a law, in order to make this statute
                    into a law. That's where Rusty and the rest of them came through so well.</p>

                <p>GREEN: Sure. I don't know, maybe - sure, it was an impressive moment, but I knew
                    it was going to happen, too. I just was absolutely convinced it was going to
                    happen. I just don't get impressed very much. Is that an awful thing to say?</p>

                    point think you weren't going to make it and you were going to have to
                    substitute some alternative?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. Yes, I thought that, but also - I don't know, I kept going back
                    to the fact that it was starting to move: the commission was starting to move,
                    the people were starting to move. It was exciting to kind of lead that charge,
                    to see them react to things that they've never done before and all of that sort
                    of thing.</p>
                <p>And then when you've got this tremendous asset of both Oregon Senators - they're
                    not beholden to me, but I certainly helped them a lot in their careers, and they
                    were totally on my side, trying to help me with it. The one thing was I had to
                    get it done while we still had control of the Senate. If we hadn't had control
                    of the Senate, I wouldn't have been able to do it because Packwood and Hatfield
                    wouldn't have been Chairman.</p>
                <p>Q: You've read a lot of different assessments of your term and its
                    accomplishments. What in your own thinking do you see that you accomplished
                    there and did for that agency?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I think we brought a moribund agency some life, and I think we
                    brought it into a modern age and brought it down to a number of people who by
                    themselves by being there had to be effective, and it applied to everybody. The
                    proof of the pudding is the fact that it's still there now, and it's doing
                    outstanding work now as we speak. And as a matter of fact, I think I read
                    somewhere where they are looking at the law again, to change it.</p>
                <p>But when you come in in 1982, and you're enabling act is the Shipping Act of
                    1916, I mean that can be pretty daunting. When you say fighting ships, there you
                    probably are talking about a battleship. But I mean, you know, it just had to be
                    done.</p>
                <p>But I always felt comfortable - and I'll go into that with you on Romania, too -
                    in kind of a turnaround situation. It's a funny thing, but I'm comfortable with
                    a turnaround situation. I say, “Okay, we'll do this and we'll do that,” and that
                    sort of thing, and get the right people.</p>
                <pb facs="0183" n="Page0183"/>
                <p>It's really motivating people is what everything amounts to, and how do you
                    motivate them. You can't motivate them in government by a promise of money as
                    you can in the private sector, so how do you motivate them? You motivate them by
                    giving them credit, seeing their name in print. A lot of things - take them out
                    for dinner, entertain them, you can do all that. If I pay for it, well, why not?
                    Who cares? And just be a human being, be a nice person to them.</p>
                <p>As I said at the beginning of this session, there were people at the Federal
                    Maritime Commission that had never been in the chairman's office. And some of
                    these little African-Americans here were just scared stiff. I wouldn't have them
                    up there by themselves because that would scare them. I'd have five or six of
                    them up together.</p>
                <p>We'd sit with Rusty on one side and me on the other, or Bob Bourgoin or something
                    like that, and we'd talk. And the personnel guy, I'd always have him there. He
                    was very good. But you know, they'd admit that they'd never been there. And I'd
                    say, “Well, you let me know, you let Marguerite -”</p>
                <p>There's something I should say. I should mention Marguerite Woods. She was my
                    secretary, and she was just fantastic. She and Rusty and I - I've been blessed
                    with the fact that I've always had good women around me that were loyal, would
                    do anything reasonable for me, protect me in any way.</p>
                <p>I'll tell you an interesting thing, you talk about how once you leave Washington
                    how quickly forgotten you are, when Joanie and I left we were driving to
                    Chicago. I was going to give the Jeep, the white Jeep, to Laddie, who was living
                    in Chicago. So we drove the white Jeep to Chicago, but I think I'd left a scarf
                    or something in the chairman's office, so I called. A strange voice answered,
                    and I said, “This is Chairman Green.” They said, “Who?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That fast?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. Three days, I think. So you know, I kind of laughed,and we got it
                    straightened out. But it was something else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rusty said that the final party was a wonderful moment
                        foeverybody and that everybody just felt terrible that you were going.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0184" n="Page0184"/>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I didn't stay the five years, but there wasn't anything else to do.
                    It's just like when I sold the businesses. I mean, I don't blame anybody for not
                    hiring me; what are they going to do with me? There's a certain time when I'm
                    the right guy, I feel comfortable doing it, and then - leave it at the top. I
                    think Michael Jordan and all of these people leaving when they're leaving is so
                    smart it's unbelievable. Don't wait till they hammer you to the ground. Leave
                    when they want you to stay.</p>
                <p>Q: And there were some moments maybe when you're confidence was a little low? I
                    think at one time you told your staff, “Quit picking me down,” and I think you
                    told Packwood around the confirmation time, “Look, if I don't make it in this,
                    I'll be ready to leave.” But it sounds like your confidence was pretty high most
                    of the time?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Most of the time I think it was high. (End of tape)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...grandest moment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, you have a lot. The signing ceremony and the farewell. But I think
                    for me on a personal basis was when Tom Moakley, the Democrat, but a good
                    friend, called me and said, “Mr. Chairman, Gleason blinked.” I said, “What do
                    you mean?” and it went - postponed it till after Christmas, the contract, so
                    therefore there would not be a strike in the Reagan Administration on the East
                    Coast during an election. That was a great feeling. But that was a personal
                    moment. I mean, Rusty knew it, but very few others. That one did excite me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that was through a period of real stress as...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: If you had my swings up and down, I bet I lost ten pounds during that
                    thing, just through stress alone. You're so lonely. You're awful lonely. I mean,
                    you've got a couple, three people around you.</p>
                <p>And the commissioners are great. They're there. I mean, thestayed, the Democrats.
                    Moakley was right there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were actually re-packing freight? They would take
                        freighand re-pack it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, they'd re-pack freight, that's something, because it hato be done by
                    them. I mean, it was expensive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you seen that in the Port of Portland?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0185" n="Page0185"/>
                <p>GREEN: No. It's not as rough a union. No. It's another union.No, they aren't as
                    rough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How rough was this union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Back there?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I'll tell you, at one time - and maybe I'm being - maybe I read too
                    many mystery novels and spy novels and things, but at one time in Washington,
                    DC. I was worried about Joanie staying. I thought she'd better go back to the
                    Pacific Coast. I mean, I really was worried that they might try to - they never
                    did, of course. But I know if I'd gone down to the docks and been identified in
                    New York, all hell would have broken loose.</p>
                <p>But Gleason was a very charming man. Before we got tied into this he had me out
                    to a labor thing once, and I went. I mean, he's an Irishman, and he was funny,
                    and introduced me with a lot of pride to some of the people who were in the
                    union with him and all that sort of thing. That's before this thing came to a
                    head. He knew it was coming, and he kept hinting about it, but I didn't say
                    anything. I didn't think that was wise at the time. Plus the fact I had to be
                    sure of four other votes; I knew I had three, but I wanted it to be unanimous
                    vote on the Commission.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a continuation of the oral history with Punch
                        Green.Today is June 3, 1999.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>So a number of things to pick up. We're in between subjects. Let's start with a
                    subject close to what we were last into, a description of social life and how it
                    worked in DC.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. It's different than it is anywhere else. And this might be a little
                    repeating of what we've done before, but giving an example, Roy and Nina Denman
                    are people - we became very close to and then later on, after we left
                    Washington, are still very close to.</p>
                <p>You have these people coming in and out of Washington all the time, and the
                    Bush-ites and the Reagan-ites and all of that, and I suppose the Clinton-ites
                    now, and that sort of thing. So you have something in common with these people,
                    and it's something entirely different than what you were doing at home, and it's
                    exciting. There's no question about it being exciting.</p>
                <pb facs="0186" n="Page0186"/>
                <p>And then you split and go back to your lives, whatever you have done. So that's
                    something that Washington DC offers the non-elected person that other cities
                    simply don't. I mean, if you come to Portland, you're coming to Portland
                    probably to live. You're not doing that in Washington DC. We've talked about
                    that a little bit with some other friends, but I just did want to mention
                    that.</p>
                <p>There's another person that was terribly important to me at the Federal Maritime
                    Commission, and that was Marguerite Woods. She was my secretary, and I guess
                    sometimes I feel a little sappy the way I always kind of sing the praises of
                    these people, but they're so important to me. I mean, Marguerite, when I was
                    there she became my secretary and Rusty Johnston's secretary. She took it upon
                    herself to learn about computers. Now, I didn't ask her to. Nobody asked her to.
                    She just did it, and she saved us, our office, the chairman's office. She was
                    always there, very similar to the secretary I'll describe a little bit more
                    dramatically, I think, that I had in Bucharest.</p>
                <p>The other thing I mentioned that I was - well, let's talk first abouBob Packwood.
                    Or do you want to talk about something else?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we identify the Denmans further.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Roy Denman? Yes. He's a very successful businessman, property development,
                    I think. He was with the administration, but he couldn't find really a good
                    spot. But he was wealthy enough to live in the best spot in Washington, DC,
                    Kalorama Circle. But he was kind of modest about it all.</p>
                <p>She's a dynamo. After being there for a few months, she was headinup the big
                    museum parties and things like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What office was he in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I don't know what he was. That's my problem. He had something to do with
                    home loan or something like that, but I just don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you did a lot with them and...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, socially. We were socially very, very good friends and had a lot in
                    common. You know, I miss seeing a lot of people, but this isn't a social
                    commentary. I think what you're more interested in is how this thing kind of
                    worked and things like that. That's as good an example as anything of how it
                    works.</p>
                <pb facs="0187" n="Page0187"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the Sulgrave Club was important to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: The Sulgrave Club was very important to me, and also to Joan. We're still
                    members of the Sulgrave Club, and members of the Metropolitan Club, as a matter
                    of fact - because I occasionally go back there with the Council of American
                    Ambassadors.The Sulgrave Club, I lived there when I first went to Washington,
                    DC. I couldn't find a place to live.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Somebody recommended it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. Joanie - yes, and then she joined. And I had a lot of the members of
                    the staff of the Sulgrave Club come down and watch Bob Packwood swear me in at
                    the Federal Maritime Commission, and they were all thrilled about that.</p>
                <p>And then they closed for the summer. Then I moved to the UniversitClub, and then
                    I found the spot that I described before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Sulgrave Club is one of many clubs, or is it the club,
                        owhat sort of function...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I think it's the club, one of the clubs in Washington, DC,particularly for
                    women. It's a women's club, really.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, really?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. Men are allowed, we're tolerated, but it's a woman'club.</p>
                <p>But I loved it. I stayed way up on the third floor. Nobody eveknew I was
                    there.</p>
                <p>I volunteered, I said, “I'll tell you what I'll do. When you closthe club, just
                    give me a key to the place.”</p>
                <p>Q: So let's talk about Bob Packwood now. My thought about getting into Packwood
                    would be to have - you have your own ideas, but it would be nice to get some
                    kind of inside understanding of him, some closer understanding of Bob Packwood.
                    You know him from his whole career, don't you?</p>
                <pb facs="0188" n="Page0188"/>
                <p>GREEN: Well, not entire career, but yes - I mean, I worked for actually Bob and
                    Nani Warren - when they were kind of running Bob Packwood's first campaign
                    against Wayne Morse, and Bob beat Wayne Morse, and there was a recount. And I
                    took on one of the main recount places here in Portland as the captain of it and
                    went down and recounted in that cold gymnasium. So yes, I became close to Bob
                    Packwood.</p>
                <p>My feeling on Bob Packwood, Bob was always kind of a loner. I didn't know him
                    socially much. But he was a great legislator. I don't condone his deportment -
                    as a matter of fact, I'll tell you something, I don't think Bob Packwood
                    condones his deportment. I went through the booze problem, and I can be
                    sympathetic with it. I, fortunately, didn't have that sort of reaction that he
                    had, but if that's what it was, at least he had the courage to resign from the
                    Senate and not further embarrass the Senate.</p>
                <p>I'm not going to get into my feelings about Clinton; that's anothesubject, and
                    you don't want to hear them.</p>
                <p>But one thing that Bob Packwood did for this state of Oregon that nobody realizes
                    is that when they were rewriting all the taxes, this is an income tax state and
                    no sales tax state - one of the few, at least they don't have them like Oregon -
                    and Bob Packwood saw to it that Oregonians could deduct their state income tax
                    from their federal income tax and other states could not deduct their sales tax,
                    and that has saved the people of this state untold millions of dollars.</p>
                <p>The person that knows this subject better than anyone is Jack Faust, if you ever
                    want to check it out. Did you see that letter of Jack Faust's? You haven't run
                    across that yet?</p>
                <p>Q: I didn't see it.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Okay. But I just think that Bob Packwood was a friend of mine. He was a
                    friend of mine when I needed him. And I just feel sorry that he's not still
                    representing our state.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's the key to his effectiveness?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: He was chairman. He had the seniority to be the chairman. And when you
                    become the chairman - I don't think people understand the power of being a
                    chairman of a major Senate or House committee. It's the way it runs. It's the
                    way government works. When you get a person, and particularly a person that's
                    like Mark Hatfield or like Bob Packwood or like Warren Magnusen, for example, or
                    “Scoop” Jackson, you've got something that's priceless to that state.</p>
                <pb facs="0189" n="Page0189"/>
                <p>I just feel that a lot of people don't appreciate that. I don't blame them for
                    not appreciating it, because they don't understand. You have to have the
                    majority. That's another thing, you see - they weren't used to the Republicans
                    being in the majority. When I was there, the Republicans were in the majority in
                    the Senate. I never would have been able to get most of my stuff done if the
                    Republicans weren't in the majority in the Senate and I wasn't a good friend of
                    Mark Hatfield and Bob Packwood. It never would have happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Metzenbaum would have won.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Metzenbaum would have won, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about personally Packwood's effectiveness?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I never saw that much. Yes, he could be very blunt and let you know,
                    blunt with his friends and let you know. But he was a leader.I never saw any
                    evidence of alcoholism. I never saw any evidence of the women situation. I never
                    saw any evidence of any of it. Once, after we had worked together on some stuff
                    and it had been successful, I said, “You know, Joanie and I would like to take
                    you and Georgie to dinner. Georgie is an awfully nice gal. And she went through
                    the ravages of hell in this thing.</p>
                <p>But anyway, “- take you out for dinner.” And we had it all set, and then about
                    the day before or something it got canceled. But he always had a very, very
                    tough schedule. And that's as close as we came to ever spending any kind of
                    social time with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you described him as kind of a loner.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, I think Bob's a loner. A lot of people are loners.It's a funny
                    business to be a loner in, isn't it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in contrast to you, I mean, you are not. You know,
                        you'rvery sociable.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, I am, but also I like my lonely moments, too. I thinwe all do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you think of someone that's effective in politics as
                        beinmore sociable.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, yes, but I can think of some guys - let's see, who's iAlaska?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0190" n="Page0190"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ted Stevens?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. Ted's not exactly the most warm-hearted person, but I loved him. He
                    and I got along fine. But you know, he's snapping at you all the time. I don't
                    blame him; if I had to get on a Thursday airplane to fly to Alaska and then be
                    back in Washington on Tuesday and do it on a rather frequent basis, I think I'd
                    be in a pretty bad humor, too.One other thing I wanted to talk a little bit
                    about is I mentioned that I was a moderate Republican. Now, you know, I've spent
                    all my life - my father and mother were very strong Republicans. Dad voted for
                    Alfred Landon. Dad felt - he hated Roosevelt, if I'm going to be honest about
                    it. We didn't have money, either. We were out of money. At one time the family
                    had had money, but they lost it.</p>
                <p>But anyway, that was the atmosphere in which I was brought up, and I loved my
                    parents and so I followed them, and I worked in the Republican Party. It was
                    fun, and I liked the people I was surrounded with and things like that.</p>
                <p>And then, as we've talked about in the interview, the Walter Huss influence
                    started, and what's happened now, I think, is that you have a far right in the
                    Republican Party - people say they're conservative Republicans. I remember
                    talking to Bill McCormick, who's going to head up the George W. Bush campaign
                    here with Butch Swindells. I said, “What do you mean by being a conservative
                    Republican?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, you know, fiscal responsibility and smallegovernment.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, we agree on that. But what about - when a lot of people think
                    conservative Republican, they're thinking of the religious far right.”</p>
                <p>He says, “No, I don't want any part of that.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Then why don't you say you're a moderate or something likthat, to
                    emphasize that you're not?”</p>
                <p>I happen to personally be pro-choice, and pro-choice is that I support Planned
                    Parenthood and things of that sort. That throws you right out of their tent, as
                    far as that goes. And that's fine; I don't want to be in their tent.But I just
                    think that there's an awful lot of people who are moderate Democrats and
                    moderate Republicans, and I think that's where the majority of people are in
                    this country. I just want to make that statement in this - and people say, “Why
                    do you even bring the abortion issue up?” And I bring it up for one reason only,
                    is because it's not a political issue, but it's always brought up. And it's
                    never brought up by the Republicans; it's always brought up by the Democrats,
                    particularly in Oregon, because this is a very pro-choice state.</p>
                <pb facs="0191" n="Page0191"/>
                <p>I don't blame them for bringing it up. I'd bring it up if I were a Democrat, too.
                    I think they're smart to bring it up. But nevertheless, there are a lot of us
                    who feel this way about it, a lot of Republicans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have you thought over the years about Oregon Republicanism
                        abeing distinct or different from - or having a liberal tradition?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, we used to have kind of a - yes, I suppose Oregon has got - we're a
                    liberal state now; there's no question. And over the years I suppose we've
                    become more liberal. I suppose World War II brought a lot of people here that
                    stayed, and they had certain ideas that weren't quite what maybe some of the
                    founding fathers had. But that's all right, I think that's healthy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm thinking of somebody like McNary, who's an Oregon

                <p>GREEN: He was a candidate for Vice President. I never knew him.Charles McNary was

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The older generation, right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. If you can believe it's true. But I mean my father loved him.I once
                    asked my dad, I said, “Dad, have you ever voted for a Democrat?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Yes.”</p>
                <p>I said, “You have? Who was it?”</p>
                <p>“Joe Carson.”</p>
                <p>Joe Carson was mayor of the city of Portland, and it's a non-partisapost.</p>
                <p>I said, “That doesn't count.”</p>

                <p>GREEN: Well, Dad felt very proud. He liked Joe Carson.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Still in politics we have the issue of the 1988 campaign,

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I sure did.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...and I wonder if you could describe your experience in

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I've described how I started it and what we did when told him I was
                    leaving the FMC. We've done all of that, haven't we?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Okay. We didn't have - because the nomination was assured, the Republican
                    nomination was assured before the Oregon primary, we didn't have a primary
                    storefront downtown. Matter of fact, you're sitting in the Bush Oregon 1988
                    Primary election headquarters right now. This is what we used.</p>
                <p>Libby Fewell, volunteered to help me, and she was fantastic, and she didn't
                    really have a lot of knowledge in how to do it, but she was just there all the
                    time.</p>
                <p>But by the time they got to Oregon, the nomination was all over - and it's going
                    to be the same thing this year in the year 2000; it will be all over by March,
                    as far as that goes, as to who the nominee is going to be - which is too bad.
                    Oregon used to be a lot of fun in primaries.</p>
                <p>But then we put on a campaign against Dukakis. I can remember I worked very hard
                    on that. I had a very good man that we hired named Kim Whitman, who ran the
                    office. So I didn't have to worry too much about things with Kim in charge
                    there.</p>
                <p>And I went to - I remember once - I knew it was close in Oregon, the polls,
                    tracking polls, were very close. And the Oregonian endorsed Bush against
                    Dukakis. There was a little hope, it seemed to me, of getting a little bit more
                    support in Eugene, which is - usually goes pretty strong Democrat, being a
                    college town; I mean, young people want to be Democrats for some reason, and not
                    much you can do about it until they get about 40, then they start to get more
                    sensible, some of them - that's my personal opinion.</p>
                <pb facs="0193" n="Page0193"/>
                <p>But anyway, so we had about 30,000 people who were switch voters, and we were
                    going to mail them right at the last minute a brochure, a voting brochure, why
                    you should vote for Bush. I didn't see it before it went out. It made the
                    mistake of having on the front cover this guy that jumped bail back East, which
                    went great in Pennsylvania and Ohio, but not in environmental Oregon; we should
                    have run an environmental thing. Had I seen it; I would have yanked it. But I
                    was in Eugene at the time the mailing went out. And we did, we lost the state by
                    about one percent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Willie Horton.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Willie Horton, that's right. And Willie Horton was on the front page of
                    that damn thing, and it was just stupid. But it was somebody from the East or
                    somebody that didn't know that called that shot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lane County, this was, this mailing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, no, it wasn't. That's where I was when it went out because I was
                    trying to buffer Lane County up a little bit to get a few more votes.</p>
                <p>If Republicans can get a few more votes in these weak spots, like Multnomah
                    County and things like that - because in those days, at least, Washington County
                    was a lot more solid for us, and the rest of the state was pretty solid for us.
                    So if we could get a little bit of help in Lane County, Corvallis and Multnomah
                    County, we can do very, very well in the state of Oregon.</p>
                <p>So anyway, it didn't happen. But I'll tell you a funny thing that did happen on
                    that campaign, and that is that - and I'll never forget this - the Dukakis
                    people had taken over a big ballroom in the Hilton Hotel. And we didn't have all
                    that money, so we just decided where the Oregon motor vehicle drivers' thing is
                    up here, that was our headquarters, you see. So we had the party there.</p>
                <p>Well, by Utah of election night the election was over. George Bush was elected.
                    So we went crazy there. All the television was at our place, all the interviews
                    were at our place, and the Dukakis people had this big ballroom but nobody came
                    to the party because their candidate didn't win.</p>
                <p>And we were very close - the first flash that came out from NBC was too close to
                    call, but then it was about, oh, fifteen seconds later it went Dukakis. There
                    was that brief moment. And I felt very bad about it because, you know, I'd
                    worked hard. It's like, you know, watching the Blazers lose the other night;
                    it's pretty tough. But you knew you'd put up a good fight.</p>
                <pb facs="0194" n="Page0194"/>
                <p>But anyway, my phone rang early in the morning in Portland on Wednesday. And I
                    was in the shower, and Joanie answered the phone. And she said, “Punch, I think
                    it's George Bush.” And I said, “You're kidding.”</p>
                <p>So I was wet, of course, but standing right there in my birthday suit and talking
                    to him, and I said, “I want you to know how sorry I am that we didn't carry
                    Oregon.” And he came back immediately and said, “Punch, think how bad it would
                    have been if you hadn't been there.” I've never forgotten those words. Can you
                    blame me for being willing to do things in my life for that man that I wouldn't
                    do for others? That's why I admire President Bush so much.</p>
                <p>One funny thing was that Joanie - she knows George Bush quite well, and she said,
                    “George, I have a problem. What do I call you? Mr. Vice President, Mr.
                    President-elect, or Mr. President?” We settled on George until he was sworn in
                    as President. Then we called him Mr. President.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you talk at that point about what you were going to do
                        next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No. As a matter of fact, I didn't. I was just so thrilled that he'd called
                    me.Then I went down to the desert, and some people had called me and said,
                    “You'd better work on the transition team to protect yourself.”</p>
                <p>I said, “I don't think I need that sort of thing with this guy. AnI'm frankly
                    tired, and I just don't want to do it.”</p>
                <p>So I didn't hear anything, and I thought, “Well, maybe -” you know. But then I
                    knew the head of presidential personnel, Chase Untermeyer and called him up, and
                    I got right through to him. So I knew that my name was still good there.</p>
                <p>And I said, “You know, I've got to kind of plan my future a little bit, and I
                    want to know whether you're going to want me back there or want me somewhere or
                    not. And we were talking about being an ambassador to some country.”</p>
                <p>He said, “My God, I'm sorry, Punch. It just slipped through the -”you know.</p>
                <p>And so he told the President, and I am told that the President didn't go
                    ballistic, but he got pretty excited - and Chase Untermeyer called me back and
                    he said, “By God, we've got to get you something.” He said, “I've got a very mad
                    President on my hands.”</p>
                <p>Then he called me up about a week later, and he said, “I've got three spots: one,
                    Romania, two, something in Africa, I didn't know what it was, and three is -” it
                    used to be Ceylon -</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sri Lanka?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Sri Lanka. I thought I was going to Sweden.</p>
                <p>Q: Why did you think Sweden?</p>
                <p>GREEN: I'd just heard it, just on the street. But anyway, I was a little
                    disappointed with the choices, but I wanted to go to Europe. And Joanie and I
                    got out an atlas and found out where - I tell you, the African country is where
                    Victoria Falls is. Chase was one of these fellows that if he wanted you to go to
                    Iceland would tell you about the Red October type the thing submarine base and
                    all that, you know. He tried to make everything glamorous. And I said, “Stop it,
                    Chase.”</p>
                <p>So Joanie looked at this one spot in Africa, and it said tsetse flies or
                    something like that, and she flipped that one over fast. I said, “I don't blame
                    you; I'm not very enthusiastic about that.” And I said, “Sri Lanka's got some
                    attractions to it, but it's...”</p>
                <p>And so we settled on Romania, behind the Curtain and all of that. And I said,
                    “Things are happening there, Joan. Look at what's happening there.” This was
                    1989, you know, and - 1989, when history is written of this century, is going to
                    be one of the big years. It has to be. It's when the Berlin Wall fell. And
                    Romania was the last to go, in December of '89. But I'm getting ahead of
                    myself.</p>
                <p>But anyway, so I called Chase back, and I told him that Romania was our choice on
                    this thing, and I never regretted it. I think it was a very lucky choice. I
                    broke the news - I used Gerry Frank because of his vast knowledge, on a private
                    basis, to talk to him about this thing, what would be the best appointment. And
                    he said, “You know, I'd like to break the story” on his column. And I said,
                    “Well...”</p>
                <p>He said, “Punch, you know you'll get a good write-up from me.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Well, you've got a good point.”</p>
                <p>So he wrote the story. It was a good story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was certain by this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, it would take a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You responded to Untermeyer and said, “I will take
                        thappointment?”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0196" n="Page0196"/>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes, and then the President calls you. Well, that's another thing.
                    You're all set, and then - now, mind you, there's a big difference between a
                    career and a non-career, particularly back there. There are some bad
                    non-careers, I guess there are. I didn't meet many of them, but I had my own
                    problems with my assigned country. There were a couple of career ambassadors who
                    weren't the greatest things in the world, either.</p>
                <p>The call came in, and I was back in Portland, and it was the President. I'd been
                    giving this thing some thought, and I said to him, “Mr. President, I know why
                    you're calling me, but I'm non-career so I'm going to break a rule here, just on
                    your friendship, and let me just say something to you. Don't you think that with
                    what is happening in Eastern Europe you might be a little better served if a
                    career ambassador was appointed?”</p>
                <p>He said, “No, Punch. I don't think so because I've seen you act under stress and
                    under fire and in conditions that are not exactly the easiest, and I've liked
                    your reactions.”</p>
                <p>I've never told anybody this.</p>
                <p>And I said, “Well, okay. Go ahead and ask me the question, then.” And he asked me
                    to be his ambassador to the Socialist Republic of Romania. And that's what it
                    says; I've got the certificate down South, as a matter of fact.</p>
                <p>And I said yes, and I said, “I will make you one promise, and one promise only.”
                    I said, “I will do the best job I can.”And that was the end of the
                    conversation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So was it decided by the President that you would take
                        Romania?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: It was decided by me what I would take. I could have had anof the
                    three.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You gave him your input and said...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I gave it to Chase Untermeyer. But because things were happening, I wanted
                    him to - after all, I'm a pimple on a dimple when you come right down to it; I
                    mean all these other things going on in the world, how much of the President's
                    time do you have? It's important to you, but it's not important to Jim Baker,
                    for example, or all that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you put him in the position of making it his
                        decision, ieffect.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0197" n="Page0197"/>
                <p>GREEN: Well, yes, it was his decision. I gave him a chance to get out of offering
                    me anything. I mean, I could just, you know, stay in civilian life and use the
                    excuse that we didn't carry the state so therefore he didn't - some television
                    commentator in Portland when we lost by two percent made the comment, “Well,
                    that's the end of Punch Green.” Said it on the air.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's kind of arbitrary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. Well, it's all right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what was the process after this phone call?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, there's a time, and then they send you some stuff. And then of
                    course you get all of this. They investigate you. And I tried to tell them, I
                    said, “The FBI's gone through up to 1985 has gone up to then; why don't you take
                    it from there and save yourself a lot of time?” But they wouldn't do it. They
                    redid the whole thing.</p>
                <p>So all that takes a long time, and you've got to get your lawyer to get all your
                    stuff, you've got to get your accountant to put all your stuff together. And
                    then I got - I'll never forget Ron Schmidt, he's the only one that did it free
                    of charge for me. He wrote my r�sum�.</p>
                <p>I said, “What do I owe you?” and he said, “Nothing. I thank you fodoing it.”</p>
                <p>Those are things you remember. I do, at least.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pretty routine, no problems run into in doing that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, they didn't. I got a call from the State Department fellow, who
                    actually lives here in Lake Oswego, I think, and he said, “You know, you didn't
                    have to tell me about the liquor, about being arrested on July 3rd, 1962.” And I
                    said, “Why is that?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, the Hillsboro Police Department has expunged theirecords.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Yes, well, reporters haven't expunged their records.” I said it in FMC;
                    I think it ought to be there - because it's about the only thing I can think of,
                    frankly. I'm proud of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So I'm trying to think of the time lapse between
                        these...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0198" n="Page0198"/>
                <p>GREEN: Then there's a lot of training. You have to realize there's a lot of
                    training. Once you - and you have to realize going through Senate confirmation
                    again, and this time I had it in front of the Pell Committee, and Paul Sarbanes,
                    who is a great Senator, a Democrat, from Maryland, and was Ken Lewis. He was Ken
                    Lewis' roommate at Princeton.</p>
                <p>And he didn't like non-career appointments. But I had gotten to know him a little
                    bit when I was Chairman of FMC. And there were some maritime things; that's a
                    big harbor, Baltimore. And he said, “Well, I guess you know how to find the
                    bathroom.” I think that was his expression. And I said, “Yes, I can figure that
                    one out.”</p>
                <p>Anyway, we kind of became friends. So he didn't hold me up, and he was holding
                    some others up. Afterwards, after my confirmation by the Senate, Ken Lewis sent
                    me a letter that he had written to Paul Sarbanes. He didn't want to let me know
                    what he'd said before, which was quite proper, but after confirmation he sent it
                    to me.</p>
                <p>Jesse Helms, of course, had some questions and that sort of thing, but there were
                    no problems there. Actually, they were questions for later, and by that time I
                    was in Bucharest when they were answered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they ask you anything about policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Not particularly. I remember two of the Romanians were sitting in the
                    back. And I remember Sarbanes, one thing he said to me - and I had both Packwood
                    and Hatfield there, both of them were advocating me. That impressed a lot of
                    people, I can tell you.</p>
                <p>Sarbanes said to me, “Well, you might have to be a little nasty. Dyou know how to
                    be nasty?”</p>
                <p>And I made a mistake, because I should have done this a little bit better. I
                    said, “Yes, Senator, I know how to be nasty.” I think that's about what I said.
                    But that's what got back to Ceausescu fast. And you can imagine, you know. And
                    when I called on the ambassador, Joanie and I, before I went over to Bucharest,
                    you see, he didn't speak English, but he had an interpreter, I had a letter with
                    me which had the State Department okay, and I said, “Would you see that your
                    president receives this prior to my giving him my authorization, my papers?”</p>
                <p>And it was kind - it wasn't flattering; I wasn't going to flatter this guy in any
                    way, shape or form, but it also showed that I wasn't there to be a nasty person,
                    I was there to try to improve the relationship between the two countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So did it refer directly to that statement?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0199" n="Page0199"/>
                <p>GREEN: No. It didn't do any good, either, and it didn't have time to do any good
                    because I got there on December the 1st and they shot him on December the
                    25th.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the Senator set you up with language?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, he was just making a side comment, but everything'recorded. The
                    Oregonian was there.</p>
                <p>I'd like you to spend a little time, if you could, on those black books. The
                    Oregonian was very fair to me when I was away, and I always would talk to the
                    Oregonian, or I'd talk to anybody from Oregon, and I'd let my press people
                    handle the New York Times, Washington Post and that sort of thing - because I
                    felt this was where I was going to live, and the Oregon Press wanted to know
                    things because I was a native Oregonian, which is a little bit different. So it
                    worked out well.</p>
                <p>Q: Did any of your questioners in the hearings have any concern about someone who
                    might be too hawkish?GREEN: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Too anti-communist?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No. No. There wasn't any of that. I am very anti-communis- very
                    anti-socialist, as a matter of fact. I think it's awfully dumb.</p>
                <p>You know, I did meet one interesting person before I went overseas. Perhaps it
                    would be appropriate to mention him now. It's Ambassador Ed Perkins. He's an
                    African-American, and I bring this up because - and he at the time was chief of
                    the State Department Foreign Service, and that's a very big job. I bring it up
                    because he was from Portland, Oregon, and his mother lives in Portland - I don't
                    know if she still does.</p>
                <p>So I went in to see him. He incidentally has been Ambassador to Australia and I
                    think South Africa, too, so he's really been quite a star. He may be retired
                    now. But I said to him, I said, “Well, I'm from Portland, too.” He said, “I see
                    that.” He said, “Where did you live?” And it kind of reminded me of NYPD Blue
                    last night; I don't know if you watched it or not.</p>
                <p>But anyway, I said, “I live in Portland Heights. Where did you live,Mr.
                    Ambassador?”</p>
                <p>“Williams Avenue.”</p>
                <pb facs="0200" n="Page0200"/>
                <p>And you could see the difference, and I tried to reach out to him, but it wasn't
                    there. He was very nice, very courteous, don't get me wrong. But it was, “You're
                    non-career; okay, prove yourself, buddy. You've had it easy all your life.”</p>
                <p>I wasn't going to tell him about some of my earlier struggles and didn't compare
                    to his anyway and. I mean, it wasn't appropriate. But I want to tell you
                    something, another reason why this award means so much to me, I think I'm the
                    first non-career ambassador to ever receive the distinguished honor award;
                    that's according to Larry Eagleburger. Now, they've given it a couple of times
                    since, is my understanding, but I think I was the first one.</p>
                <p>So I gave a party at the Sulgrave Club when I was leaving and getting ready to
                    come to Portland. And the reason I bring this up is Ed Perkins came to the
                    party. And I took him aside and took him over to the corner, and I told him that
                    his presence there meant more to me, I think, than anybody there - and there
                    were some awfully “big” people there. Well, the President wasn't there, but I
                    mean there were some - you know, a lot of people there.</p>
                <p>But what had happened is, at least it said to me I'd proven myself man in his
                    judgment. And that was a good feeling. I've earned it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It really completes the story. What was his relationship
                        to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I never saw him after that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He wasn't part of the operation of preparing you or
                        anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No. No, but you should make these rounds. At the time he was what I
                    described, and that's head of all the - you know, I should meet him, and he
                    should know me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about the preparation that they did for you as
                        non-career ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0201" n="Page0201"/>
                <p>GREEN: Well, they gave me some books. I'm trying to think of the one book, which
                    was pretty good - well, I can't think of it right now. I'll think of it
                    sometime.We went to the Foreign Service Institute, and we spent some hours
                    there. I tried to learn the language somewhat. Joanie was totally hopeless on
                    the thing. I think it's appropriate now to tell you, because it would be after
                    the revolution I was on my way down to Constanta, and I stopped by a nuclear
                    power plant in Romania which was under the course of construction, of which that
                    is the - everything in the socialist world is under the course of construction,
                    they don't finish anything. But the reason I stopped by to see it was because it
                    had some Westinghouse equipment in there, and I thought I could at least see
                    with my own eyes whether it had been destroyed or something of that type because
                    nobody was getting in, you see, to see any of this stuff.</p>
                <p>But I saw a man before I left who was a Romanian nuclear scientist, and he spoke
                    the King's English, better than any of us. Just Oxfordian tones. And he said,
                    “Mr. Ambassador, you're the first American Ambassador to come to my country that
                    doesn't speak my language.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Well, let me tell you something, Professor. You're right, I'm
                    embarrassed by that. But I'm going to give you a choice. I've been here about a
                    month, a month-and-a-half, and you know how busy I've been. Now, I can become
                    fluent in your language, or I can try to get something done. What do you want?
                    You can't have them both.”</p>
                <p>He said, “You're doing the right thing.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “I know it.”</p>
                <p>And I got excellent people that would immediately interpret for me. And a lot of
                    people, of course, spoke English anyway. But it is an interesting thing about
                    this language thing, through Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, hundreds of
                    thousands of tapes were smuggled to these countries behind the Curtain, and the
                    people would listen, and they'd listen to Radio Free Europe or they'd listen to
                    Voice of America, and it was in English, a lot of it. They'd listen to the
                    music, and they'd see the movies. And that's how they got to know America.</p>
                <p>Under Ceausescu the people in Bucharest were so desperate on their television
                    sets they were tuning in Bulgarian television for entertainment. Bulgarian
                    television, imagine. Because all Romanian television was of Ceausescu opening a
                    plant or making a speech. That's all there was. It was terrible. Just
                    terrible.</p>
                <p>But we had - it was an interesting time. I was worried about the language a
                    little bit until the President had me over before I left - matter of fact he had
                    our class over before I left, and he told me that - I just reminded him, I said,
                    “You said you wanted to see me before I left.”</p>
                <p>And he's a man of his word, and he was dog tired. I said, “Whdidn't you tell me
                    you were this tired? You didn't have to see me.”</p>
                <pb facs="0202" n="Page0202"/>
                <p>But anyway, he said, “Are you learning the language?”</p>
                <p>I said, “No, not really. I'm trying.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, I got along with the Chinese all right. Don't worrabout it.”</p>
                <p>That's kind of helpful.</p>
                <p>They took our class down to - there were about 10 or 12 of us ambassadors, career
                    and non-career, both in the same class, lectures and things like that, and here
                    we were - they put us on the spot how we'd handle a press conference and that
                    sort of thing. Actually, it was very helpful.</p>
                <p>They flew us in a small plane down to an island in Florida, and as we were flying
                    to the island, a guy jumps out of the john with a submachine gun under his arm,
                    you know, taking over the plane, and makes us all put our heads under our knees.
                    Women included.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you believe this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, no. But by the same token, the guy was pretty serious about it. No,
                    I didn't believe it, you didn't kid around about it because the guy was real
                    into it.</p>
                <p>When we were down there it was interesting, I didn't know it, but we were being
                    televised and listened to all the time.[Interruption]</p>
                <p>Anyway, we were there about three or four days. Wives weren't witus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why do you think they pulled this gunman...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, just to give us an experience, what could happen when yogo into some
                    of these places.</p>
                <p>We were at all times under surveillance when we were down there. Didn't know it
                    until the last day they showed us pictures of ourselves when we didn't think we
                    were being photographed.</p>
                <p>Then we learned how to drive an automobile and make a J turn on the sands of the
                    beach and that sort of thing, if you were in pursuit by the terrorists and all
                    that sort of thing. It was interesting. I don't think I could make a J turn now,
                    but -.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were trying to prepare you psychologically? GREEN:
                        Yes. That's right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were trying to scare people off...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I don't think they were trying to scare anybody. No, none of us were
                    scared. I mean, we'd all been through it. But we knew some of us were going into
                    some pretty tough spots, and I think probably mine was the toughest. And some of
                    these African places are tough. I mean, Beirut or all that. That guy wasn't
                    there.</p>
                <p>But yes, when we got through we knew that we were - we had a feeling that this is
                    a possibility. We were shooting guns and things. I remember bringing back the
                    target. I'd never shot a gun in my life, I didn't know anything about it, but
                    they taught me how to do this with a revolver and how to hold it, and I hit the
                    target. And I said, “Let me have that target.” Not exactly a bull's eye, but I
                    had hit it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't you have any rifle range when you were in the

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, in the service. Yes, when I was 18 years of age. Yes,I did do that. I
                    was a buck private, too, you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you in residence now all this time for several months
                        or holong a period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: You mean in Washington?</p>

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No. We lived at the Sulgrave Club.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. You're living there for a period of - is it months?
                        GREEN: Yes, I'd say we were there for six, eight weeks, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Then the big day comes, of course, and you go in to see the President, and he
                    gives me my - I don't have it with me, but that tie clasp. (End of tape)</p>
                <p>Here you can see us together here. It's taken at that time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So individually, not as a group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, no. Individually. And Brent Scowcroft was always there, at least with
                    me. I admired him a lot. I told him once, I said, “You know, you've got about
                    the same hairline I've got, but I kind of like seeing you next to my president
                    when I see the world pictures. I know he's getting the right advice.”</p>
                <p>So anyway, Brent was there. And then the President and I talked. And then I
                    repeated my promise that I'd do the best job that I could and then got out of
                    there. You don't want to take too much of the President's time on anything.</p>
                <p>I remember walking out of the office, the oval office, with BrenScowcroft, and
                    Brent says to me, “Punch, I'll be out seeing you.”</p>
                <p>I said, “No, you won't.”</p>
                <p>He said, “What do you mean, I won't?” You know, a little startled.I mean, after
                    all, he's number one to the President.</p>
                <p>I said, “I don't want anybody of rank out seeing me as long as Ceausescu's there.
                    The only person of any rank from the United States ought to be me. Then when we
                    get rid of him, then I need all the help I can get.”Q: Now, I don't understand
                    why you said that.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Because I didn't want Ceausescu in any way to get the idea that he's
                    approved by the United States. I wanted to cold shoulder that guy as much as I
                    could. I didn't have to do it, fortunately.</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact, I'll tell you why I went out December the first. You will
                    notice that I got a letter from Larry Napper, when he was over there and he was
                    the charg�. He was just letting me know the conditions. I was supposed to go
                    over there about two months earlier, and then they asked me to stay until after
                    Thanksgiving, which was fine because I had a chance to have an extra
                    Thanksgiving with my family.</p>
                <p>But they were praising Ceausescu for his new four-year plan, and I would have had
                    to attend all the events as Ambassador from the United States. All Ambassadors
                    had to. Larry went. He was the charg�; and he had the power of the Ambassador
                    when the Ambassador is out of the country.</p>
                <p>So I waited until the four-year celebration was over, and then thesaid it was all
                    right to go. So we went December 1st.</p>
                <pb facs="0205" n="Page0205"/>
                <p>Q: Let's have some sort of an appreciation of the prepping that you'd had on the
                    subject of Romania and the instructions that you had, policy instructions on how
                    to handle things.</p>
                <p>GREEN: I didn't get that much as you might think. I think it's mostly common
                    sense on how you do it. You will see in the statement that Larry Eagleburger
                    makes when he hands me the award that usually non-careers are sent to places
                    where the conditions are so great between the countries nothing could happen, or
                    the conditions are so bad between the countries that nothing can - that you
                    can't make it worse. And I was kind of caught in the middle there. We had
                    conditions bad that all of a sudden they became “we've got to get them
                    better.”</p>
                <p>But as I've said, that is kind of my specialty, this turn-around situation, and
                    working with the people and working with the people I had which were excellent.
                    Before going to post, I was sitting in the White House waiting to see somebody,
                    and Jim Baker came bouncing by, and he'd say to me, he'd say, “Punch, we're
                    going to get that guy during your term.” I said, “Good.” You know, that was
                    about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you went over he said that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. And I'll tell you another thing I said to the President, and this
                    just came back to me, I said to him, “Mr. President, I'm going out there as a
                    non-career, and it's not exactly friendly territory with Ceausescu. The biggest
                    thing I have going for me is my friendship with the President of the United
                    States. If you in some way could signal that to Bucharest, in some meaningful
                    way, I think that would be of extreme help to me.”</p>
                <p>And of course Brent heard every word I said, and we had a meeting of the NATO
                    ambassadors stationed in Bucharest. Yes, we were having a NATO ambassadors'
                    meeting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Brussels, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, this wasn't Brussels. This group met once a month in Bucharest. Just
                    the ambassadors. And I was sitting in my first meeting, and Larry Napper comes
                    busting into the room - it was in the German embassy. It was one of the quiet
                    rooms. And I kind of looked at him and thought, “What's going on?” And it was a
                    direct order from the President of the United States of America to NATO
                    ambassadors asking their full cooperation to me and things like that. And of
                    course it was...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very early on? Before...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I was in Bucharest.</p>
                <pb facs="0206" n="Page0206"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before the events?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. Well, I think so. I think so. Yes, it was beforthe events.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did Jim Baker say, “We're going to get this guy?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, just the way he is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Something he knew that you didn't know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, I don't think so. We all had the feeling, but you know Jim was a
                    friend of mine, and we just - back and forth. Don't attach a lot of
                    significance. He was right. He was the first guy to call it right.</p>
                <p>But that was a good way to start with President Bush's directive to NATO. As far
                    as other instructions go, oh, a lot of things they give you are - always trying
                    to sell you - I had a tuxedo, so they said, “Don't you want some white tie and
                    tails?” And I said, “I don't think you need it for Bucharest,” but I said, “I'll
                    get them if I need them.” But I never did, of course. Did need a tuxedo.</p>
                <p>A lot of times the NATO ambassadors would meet - and this was more under
                    Ceausescu - would meet in tuxedos just to put a tuxedo on. And later just for
                    the wives', I think, for morale more than anything else.</p>
                <p>And then that at night after I'd seen the President and saw alsGeneral Scowcroft,
                    Joanie and I left DC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, Joanie's going over, was that any question that she
                        thoughof not going over or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: She was going to come over later on. I was going to go over I thought in
                    October, and then she was going to come over about December 1st, when we did.
                    But it worked out where she and I could go together, which made it a lot nicer
                    for me, I can tell you. I needed all the nerve I could get, don't kid
                    yourself.</p>
                <p>I wasn't afraid, I was never afraid, but apprehensive, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0207" n="Page0207"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's get into the arrival. You must have some
                        memories owhat it was like.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I do. One of the nice things about being an ambassador, they fly you out
                    with your wife first class and fly you back with your wife first class, and
                    they'll pay for it. One of the nice things about being ambassador - United was
                    just putting in the service to - no, I went out Pan Am, by God. It was Pan Am.
                    And if they know the ambassador has purchased a tourist ticket, they'll put you
                    immediately in first class. That was a very nice perk, when I'd go back and
                    forth.</p>
                <p>Joanie and I got on the plane about eight o'clock at night. I didn't know it, but
                    one of my security guards was on the plane, too. Nobody told me. It was Pam Am,
                    I think it was Pan Am, and then we transferred in Frankfurt and flew in, and I
                    looked down, and here was a city of two million people, very few lights. Eleven,
                    twelve o'clock at night.</p>
                <p>And as we were gliding in, I looked out and saw guards at all thposts and things.
                    And I said, “Boy, I'm behind the Curtain now.”</p>
                <p>And they gave us a chocolate cake. The airline did that. They gave us a chocolate
                    cake, which we left on the plane, damn it. I've always kind of regretted that.
                    But anyway, so we went down, and there was the car with the American flag on it,
                    waiting at the bottom of the steps with all the staff there and the Romanian
                    minister for America; I've forgotten what his name was.</p>
                <p>So we drove to - oh, the reason I know that there was a U.S. guard on it, I
                    happened to just look up, and I saw a pistol being handed to this guy that got
                    off the plane with me by the guy who subsequently was head of my security. So I
                    just said, “They're watching out for us, not telling me.”</p>
                <p>So anyway, so we went in and I had a press conference, welcome tRomania type of
                    thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What time of day was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: It was about 12:00 at night, but it was run in the day. But the equipment
                    is like a crystal set. It's the darnedest thing you've ever seen. I've got a
                    picture in there, I think, with me with this thing with a picture of George Bush
                    behind me talking on Christmas Day to the Romanian people. It's unbelievable,
                    it's simply unbelievable.</p>
                <p>But anyway, so then they drove us to the residence. They had sent me - in America
                    they'd sent me a tape of the residence and all of the amenities and the people,
                    and they were all lined up, upstairs, downstairs maid and butler and cooks, you
                    got the works. I mean, it was something else. It was Upstairs, Downstairs a
                    couple of times. Gardeners, furnace watchers. And they were all members of the
                    Securitat, of course, at that time. But they all were out to greet us.</p>
                <pb facs="0208" n="Page0208"/>
                <p>It sounds a little worse than it is. You just point to the ceiling like this when
                    you start talking if you don't want to say anything. You just write it out. This
                    was during the first 25 days or so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You pointed up, you gesture upward...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, just how you get - unless you were in the bubble. Ithe bubble you
                    talked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that means in case there's a wire...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, in case there's a wire. And I don't think there's amuch wiring -
                    maybe there was, but you know, it gets pretty confining.</p>
                <p>But anyway, so I met all of them. Then Joanie and I went to bed, and they left us
                    alone until I woke up, which was - I don't know when it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the place like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: The residence?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, it was beautiful. Gorgeous. It used to be the prime minister's home.
                    It's not owned by the United States; it's rented. We usually own them, but this
                    is a rent. It's owned by the government, I think, and we had problems with that.
                    Every once in a while, they wanted to kick us out, and I said, “That's fine. I
                    can think of a few programs you're not going to get, too.” And that shut them up
                    in a hurry, you know; I mean, the game goes on all the time.</p>
                <p>But it had an inside swimming pool, heated. Sauna. And I'll tell you what it had,
                    it had large gardens, all walled in. It was a huge house.</p>
                <p>What I did was after I'd been there a while and after the revolution and things -
                    we can go into that in a little while, but the use of the house, and this isn't
                    a bad time for it - where were my off-duty Marines going to go and play? Where
                    were the Americans with their families going to go and safely play with their
                    families? There's no place to go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There wasn't a compound?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0209" n="Page0209"/>
                <p>GREEN: No. They had parks. They have beautiful parks in Bucharest.</p>
                <p>So what I did was I opened the residence up, and there were guards all around,
                    all Romanian guards. And then they had little things made up to let them know
                    that they were okay to go through. And they'd stay out in the yard. I'd look out
                    the window sometimes, and they'd be having picnics with the families out there
                    and all that.</p>
                <p>So it was a good spot for them. You see, these Marines, they couldn't be married,
                    except the top, the guy that's the staff sergeant, he could be married. But
                    there was also a non-fraternization in effect in Romania, and some of those
                    Romanian women are absolutely beautiful women. So we had a few little problems,
                    but nothing that couldn't be handled. And it was handled.</p>
                <p>But I felt much more comfortable that the Americans had a safe place to go. And
                    of course it kind of built a community around us. I mean, they were grateful to
                    us because I don't think previous ambassadors had done that. Maybe some of them
                    had, I don't know. Because you see you get new people every two years. That's
                    how long they are in what they call these kind of stress areas.</p>
                <p>Q: You know, Eagleburger in his speech at the award said that it's common for a
                    non- career ambassador to have a lot of trouble with his professional staff, his
                    career staff. Had you heard about that before you took off? Did you have an
                    awareness of that?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So were you considering that as you arranged...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Always considering it. I was thinking about it all the time.</p>
                <p>I will tell you something, and we'll have to jump a little bit, but the
                    ambassador in one of these books - and incidentally, I thought it was a good
                    omen, I was reading in a book they sent me about Romania, the opening paragraph,
                    “Romania in size should be compared to the state of Oregon.” I thought that was
                    kind of interesting. I said, “Well, that's a pretty good omen.”</p>
                <pb facs="0210" n="Page0210"/>
                <p>But you get to choose - this is a good time to bring Dot into this thing - you
                    get to choose your secretary, and you get to choose your DCM, that's the Deputy
                    Chief of Mission, the charg� when you're not there. And because of this hurry
                    all of a sudden, not wanting me to go out there but not having an ambassador
                    there, they wanted at least the charg� there. And they called me up, and they
                    said they had this fellow Larry Napper in mind, “You'll like him very much,” and
                    all. I said, “Hold it. I haven't met him, haven't talked to him. I've got to
                    live with this guy. He's going to make me or break me. Huh-uh. I want to know
                    him.”</p>
                <p>“Well, we don't have time.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, get him on an airplane tonight, have him stay at my house, go out
                    to Washington tomorrow.”“Well, we can't afford that.”</p>
                <p>I said, “I can. Put him on an airplane first class, if you want. I don't care. I
                    want him out here. I'm going to spend some time with him.”</p>
                <p>Smartest thing I ever did because Larry - he came out, I liked him immediately,
                    and we talked. We talked into the night in Portland in the den, and we had a
                    complete understanding. For your information, an embassy is the whole complex,
                    that's everything; the chancellery is where the ambassador's office is. But an
                    embassy will work very well if the ambassador and the DCM get along well and see
                    eye-to-eye on things, and Larry and I never had a real argument. We had one, and
                    I had to overrule him on one thing. It was tough, but it was all right. I've
                    forgotten what it was. Couldn't have been too important because I can't remember
                    it. I remember it was rather tough on me because - but I thought he was wrong on
                    that particular item.</p>
                <p>So he came out to Portland, and then he left. And I called them and said, “I
                    couldn't be more delighted,” and they were delighted. And incidentally, they did
                    pay for the airline ticket, the State Department. You're not here to talk about
                    the State Department budget, but I can tell you one thing, the State Department
                    is - it's ridiculous. The State Department does a lot of good for a lot less
                    money than one of these damn bombs that's going over, and the State Department
                    is always, always hard up for money because it has no constituency behind it.
                    It's kind of like getting the Shipping Act passed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also in FMC you gained sort of an inside impression of
                        whabudget problems are.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0211" n="Page0211"/>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes, I was used to it. And the funny thing about it is everybody tells
                    me how broke we are and everything else, and then just the day before - or the
                    month before the fiscal ends, arriving in a warehouse, in one of our warehouses,
                    one of the embassy warehouses, is some office furniture that nobody had ordered.
                    Got to get it out. And I didn't take it; it was for the ambassador's office. I
                    didn't want it. I said, “Let the next ambassador have it. You can leave it right
                    where it is. I'm staying with the stuff that got me through the revolution.” I
                    felt at home with it.</p>
                <p>But it's interesting kind of - and I'm going to use a dirty word here, if that's
                    all right, because it's the only way you can do it. The selection of the
                    secretary I felt was terribly important, I've always felt, from Mabel Bishop to
                    Dee Bedgood to Marguerite Woods, and now this one. And I had about three or four
                    applications, and it surprised me. You've heard there have been - it's not
                    talked about much, but there have been problems between secretaries and
                    ambassadors, as you can imagine. And I didn't want any of that. I felt my mind
                    was going to be full enough that I didn't need any of that.</p>
                <p>So I was looking for some one person in particular, a type. And this one - and
                    two of the women were in Europe, and all I could do was read their r�sum�, but I
                    couldn't talk to them. And I'm a person that wants to talk to somebody. I want
                    to see what they look like and how they react.</p>
                <p>So anyway, this nice lady comes in, and her name is Dot Evans. And I will give
                    you her telephone number; you certainly want to talk to her. I'll give you Larry
                    Napper's and the others, too. But anyway, she's about probably four or five
                    years younger than I am. And what really appealed to me was she had been through
                    very tough posts in Panama and some other spots, you can ask her - and she
                    didn't like the U.S. Panamanian ambassador at all. But anyway, I said to her, I
                    said, “You know, I think you and I can get along pretty well on this thing.” And
                    she looked at me, and she said, “Mr. Green, I want you to know something.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “All right. What?”</p>
                <p>She said, “I am a lady.”I said, “Okay. I want you to know something. I am a
                    gentleman.” Then I hesitated. And I said, “However, Dot, we're going to be going
                    into a situation where I think daily I'm going to have some very tough
                    situations happening, and I cannot get through a situation like that without
                    using the word 'shit.' Does that bother you?”</p>
                <p>“No, it doesn't at all.”</p>
                <p>I said, “If I have your permission to use that, including in front oyou, I
                    appreciate it.”</p>
                <p>And I mean it, too. It's a great reliever to me, that word.</p>
                <pb facs="0212" n="Page0212"/>
                <p>So we became very good friends. She was loyal, just totally loyal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's get more of an idea of Larry Napper, what Larry is
                        like iterms of personality and characteristics and behaviors.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: He worked very hard. He ended up ambassador to Latvia, which is very good.
                    After having meetings, he'd always go back and dictate a cable immediately, no
                    matter what. I'd say, “Larry, it can wait till morning; nothing was
                    settled.”</p>
                <p>He was a strenuous runner. He jogged a lot. It worried me a little bit, jogging
                    around Bucharest, but it was okay. He has a wonderful wife named Mary Napper and
                    two sons.</p>
                <p>We kind of formed a team where I said, “You know, I was chairman of the board of
                    a couple of companies when I was in the private sector, and I had CEO's. Why
                    don't we work it that way? I'm comfortable with that. What about you being -
                    I'll be chairman of the board, and you be CEO and that sort of thing?”</p>
                <p>And another thing I said, “I want to make a deal with you right at the start. I
                    don't want you to do anything without telling me what it's about and things like
                    that, and I will promise you that I will never do anything knowingly that you
                    don't know about, so that if anything happens to one of us, the other will be
                    fully informed of what is going on, what's happening.”</p>
                <p>And we did that. We kept that going. There was never any doubt.</p>
                <p>And he spoke the language fluently, I might add. He's a real pro.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What else did his acting as CEO mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, he ran the embassy. You know, a lot of the people didn't want to
                    maybe talk to a non-career ambassador, this is right at the start, they'd rather
                    go - Consul General, for example, Ginny Young, who was as a matter of fact a
                    girl from Portland, Oregon - I don't know where she is now, but she never did
                    get used to the fact that I was non-career and an ambassador. I don't think she
                    ever liked it.</p>
                <p>But we've got quite a story to tell you about later on about GinnYoung and “The
                    Miserables.” Don't let me forget “The Miserables.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll pick that up. I've got it in my notes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0213" n="Page0213"/>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. That's a key thing that happened.</p>
                <p>Larry told me that he was only going to be there two years, and that was about a
                    year-and-a-half - he'd had about six months' service. So then Jonathan Rickert,
                    I chose him the same way I chose Larry. But I did that on the telephone. I went
                    to Vienna. You don't want to hear about that right now; I'm jumping ahead of
                    myself.</p>
                <p>What more do you want to know about Larry?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I don't know. We'll see Larry in action as we go
                        along.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>But almost immediately you had a meeting with Ceausescu.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, we had a meeting with a minister first, some minister. And I learned
                    very soon, always have an empty bladder when you go into one of those things.
                    You don't think about that, but that I learned. Every diplomat should learn
                    that. That should be in every book.</p>
                <p>And then, yes, the day came. I had to choose four people. I was allowed to choose
                    four people to go from the embassy, and of course a lot of people wanted to go.
                    And Larry was, of course, number one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was to meet Ceausescu?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, for the presentation of my credentials. I chose Larry, of course. And
                    I wanted a woman, so I chose Ginny Young, my Consul General. Then I chose my
                    military attach� Bronco Marankovich, wonderful guy. And I said, “Bronco, I want
                    you to look so good, I want you fully dressed with every medal you can borrow.”
                    And then I had my political guy there. A lot of other people wanted to go, but I
                    had to make a choice, so those were my choices. And I think they were the right
                    choices.</p>
                <p>So we went. And I could see at the other end of the room this milling around and
                    all this. And there was Ceausescu, I could see him. He looked up, looked at me
                    with, I think, disdain.</p>
                <p>So the time came for me to go forward, and they handed me - just as I was going
                    forward, they handed me another envelope and said, “This is the former
                    Ambassador's papers. Would you mind handing those to Ceausescu?”</p>
                <p>“Any key words I'm supposed to say?”</p>
                <p>“No.”</p>
                <pb facs="0214" n="Page0214"/>
                <p>So I drummed up something when I gave it to him. He spoke no English, Ceausescu.
                    And so then I gave him mine - there are certain key words you're supposed to
                    say, and I got those key words out. Every ambassador around the world, when he
                    presents credentials has these key words you've got say. I don't remember what
                    they are.</p>
                <p>So then we went, and my people sat over there in the corner - this was in early
                    December of 1989 - and I sat here. The interpreter was here, and Ceausescu was
                    there.</p>
                <p>He was about my size, and he had a tic, like this, particularly whehe'd get
                    nervous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His head twitched?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, a twitch. And I tried to get that in a cable.</p>
                <p>Also his fingers were thick, like he'd been taking a medicine, whicI reported to
                    the CIA.</p>
                <p>But we started off, and I had with me notes - because you've got to realize, Jim,
                    I had no regard for this man whatsoever. I mean, I really don't like those
                    people. But I was representing my country, which meant a lot to me, and I didn't
                    want to disgrace it, and I was non-career, so I therefore had notes right there,
                    and I didn't try to hide it. So I started out very nicely, and then I went into
                    a few things, human rights was one thing, and he just went through the roof.As
                    his voice went up, his interpreter's voice would go up. And I'd just sit there
                    and listen to what he said, and then I'd look down at my next note and go on.
                    But there was a time when the interpreter was talking, and Ceausescu was looking
                    at me, staring, just like I'm doing now. So I said, “To hell with it” to myself.
                    So I started staring back. And I give you my word of honor, he looked away
                    first, and I felt totally triumphant, and we stared for a good minute or so.</p>
                <p>And during that time that I was staring at this dictator's face, I thought of my
                    family, my wife, I thought of Pioneer Square, and I thought of the Christmas
                    tree in Portland, Oregon, if you can believe it. It was just about being lit
                    about this time, I think, about December the 4th, 5th or something like that.
                    They took me very fast when I got to Romania because they wanted recognition
                    fast.</p>
                <p>And so when I left Ceausescu, I shook hands briefly with him, and his hand was
                    wet, and the United States Ambassador's hand was dry. And I tell you, I felt
                    good about that, too. And then of course the rest of it's history.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When he went through the roof, what behavior was

                <pb facs="0215" n="Page0215"/>
                <p>GREEN: Well, he'd just shout. You could see all his people, there were about, you
                    know, 50 or so lieutenants around just like this, you know.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, in my office there's a history of him. But that was given to me by
                    the British Ambassador, when I think about it. Not much. I mean, I knew that he
                    was - what do you hear about those people? I knew that he and his wife were very
                    close. I knew that Elena Ceausescu was a very tough woman. I asked once, after
                    I'd accepted, if there was a golf course in Romania - have I told you this
                    story?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: - and the desk officer said, “I don't know.” I was still in Portland, as a
                    matter of fact. I said, “Would you find out for me? My wife plays golf.”</p>
                <p>He called me back in about an hour, and he said, “Well, it's about ahour outside
                    of Bucharest.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Well, that's not too bad.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, it's an hour by air. It's in Belgrade.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Joanie ever make it to the golf course in

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Sure. We both did once. It was a golf course in Belgrade. God, that was a
                    beautiful city when we saw it. They took me all through it, the American
                    Ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After this first encounter with Ceausescu, what did your

                <pb facs="0216" n="Page0216"/>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I had a funny thing. I went back to my office - and this only
                    happened to me once, and it never happened again. I just felt empty. And I went
                    to see Brian Flora, my political officer - he was a lot of help to me. But
                    anyway, I said, “You know, I'm just not used to this environment.”He said, “Mr.
                    Ambassador, come on, you knew it was coming. Get with it. We're all for you.
                    We're going to pull this thing through now. Forget about it.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “You're right.” And it never happened to me again. BuI just had this
                    slump - boy!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Slump?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. It only lasted about five minutes, but it was there. I've never had
                    that feeling before. I just felt very, very lonely. But the right guy was there
                    at the right time.</p>
                <p>I went to a meeting of their senate. I sat with the British ambassador way, way
                    up high, and behind us were Securitat people, you know, seeing our reaction. And
                    it's a funny thing, you get into this thing - maybe I've read enough of these
                    spy novels, but nothing surprised me much.</p>
                <p>We listened to the people praising Ceausescu, and he and his wife would sit there
                    and write. And then one would get up and walk out, and the other would stay, and
                    vice versa. And this thing would go on and on and on. And all the church
                    dignitaries were there, all the generals were there, and all of the admirals -
                    they had a pretty good fleet, as a matter of fact.</p>
                <p>And then I left, Joanie and I left that afternoon for Brussels for a meeting of
                    the American ambassadors in Europe, and we were there three or four days. That's
                    where Shirley Temple Black and I became very good friends. And I was the only
                    one at that time who still - the dictator hadn't fallen, you see. And they were
                    kidding me, saying, “You'd better get back there and do it” and all that sort of
                    stuff.</p>
                <p>So anyway, that was a lot of fun, to meet your fellow European Ambassadors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said you were impressed even by - that's the language
                        you used - by Shirley Temple Black. I wonder why you said “even.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, no. I didn't mean it that way. That's when she and I started to become
                    good friends. You know, she's non-career, and she's done a great deal for this
                    country. Everybody's kind of hanging back from Shirley Temple Black because
                    she's Shirley Temple Black. You know, I did, too. But she kind of liked some of
                    my saucy comments I'd make in the meetings, and so she laughed.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0217" n="Page0217"/>

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, I can. I can give you one. We were at a meeting, and it was cold,
                    very cold. I knew they weren't going to spend five minutes on Romania, or five
                    minutes on Bulgaria - the Bulgarian ambassador was there, too. American. And I
                    raised my hand to one of the key guys, and he said, “Yes, Mr. Ambassador?”</p>
                <p>I said, “I don't want to take any time away from Romania, but I hava
                    request.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Yes, Mr. Ambassador?”</p>
                <p>“Would you please shut the windows? I'm freezing to death.”</p>
                <p>Everybody clapped. So she kind of liked that and all that sort othing. It kind of
                    broke the ice.</p>

                        ambassador wanew and...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, in the NATO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm thinking of back in Bucharest, these different
                        embassies,what were you getting from them? What sort of input?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, one of the key things you had to do as a new ambassador is that you
                    have to make calls on - you're the one that has to make the calls: for example,
                    on the Russian ambassador. As seniority, really, is what you're supposed to
                    do.</p>
                <p>So I got around to about half of them before all hell broke loose.Then forgot
                    about it.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, I'm kind of wondering if they gave you a different picture of the
                    situation in Romania from what you had been prepared to understand about the
                    country?</p>
                <pb facs="0218" n="Page0218"/>
                <p>GREEN: No. I don't think they gave me anything. I think I got just about what I
                    expected to get. Matter of fact, I'd get a little surprised if I'd see a
                    different type of streetcars and things like that.</p>
                <p>Everything's dirty. They've got these construction cranes everywhere, and not one
                    of them worked. Not one of them in the 26 months I was there moved, with the
                    exception of the one for the museum, which got bombed out in the revolution.
                    They did repair that - thanks I think largely to the Metropolitan Museum of Art
                    in New York. They came over. They were awful snobs, I thought, and they'd only
                    speak in French, but by God, they did what they said they were going to do, so I
                    haven't complained too much about them. I said, “Would you speak to the American
                    ambassador, please, in English? I'd appreciate that.”</p>
                <p>He was all right. The Romanians really would rather - French used to be their
                    second language, but they'd rather speak English, anyway; that's what they were
                    used to talking now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So at a certain point things began - how sudden was it
                        whethings changed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I'll tell you, it's kind of interesting. It was December the 17th in
                    Timisoara, which is on the Hungarian border, this priest was ordered to leave
                    his church. You'll find it in the notes. And he refused, and the people formed a
                    circle around the church, the people. Securitat went there, the security police.
                    The security police in Romania were as tough as anything you had anywhere in the
                    world, I think. They were real thugs. And they started just popping people. But
                    instead of them all spreading and running, they just got closer together.
                    Incredible courage. And anyway, the priest didn't leave. They stopped them.</p>
                <p>And that reached us, of course - it reached us before others. We had awfully good
                    communication. The United States is a very well-equipped country overseas. And a
                    lot of that I don't want to talk about because I don't think I should. I mean,
                    it's ten years ago, but why should I?</p>
                <p>Then I remember that we got a call from the little Anglican Church. It was
                    approaching Christmas, and they wanted me to read something out of the Bible
                    Christmas Eve. And I've never read anything out loud out of the Bible in my
                    life. And the British ambassador had the same problem, but he was more used to
                    it; he was career and he had performed three functions before. He was a
                    wonderful man, incidentally. I'll tell you about him later.</p>
                <p>So I went up to meet, about December the 20th, the 19th, went up to meet with the
                    minister to see where I was supposed to stand and what I was supposed to read,
                    and it wasn't very long. Then we left, with the American flag on the car.</p>
                <pb facs="0219" n="Page0219"/>
                <p>And there were a lot of people all around, all milling around. I thought, “This
                    is peculiar.” And then as I was leaving people would see the American flag on
                    the car, and they'd give me the V sign and then hide it. I'd give them the V
                    sign back, you know. I said, “Something is happening.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Paneit,” who I think was Securitat, but he was a gooSecuritat, he
                    was on my side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was with you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: You bet. Became a very close friend.</p>
                <p>Anyway, so I went back to the chancellery, and needless to say never returned
                    there for that Christmas Eve service.</p>
                <p>But about December - I'd say around the 20th or so, 20th or 21st, Ceausescu - and
                    that's in one of those tapes - gave a speech. And the university square was
                    jammed, and he was up on this balcony - and he started talking, and television
                    was right on him, and I was watching him from the embassy T.V.</p>
                <p>Then all of a sudden you heard these voices from the rear, and Ceausescu looked
                    up, didn't pay any attention and went on with his speech. And they started going
                    through the crowd, the voices, and what they were saying was “Down with
                    Ceausescu,” or “Kill Ceausescu,” or something like that. It was unheard of.</p>
                <p>And Ceausescu looked up, and he hesitated, and then the people started running
                    around. And he panicked then. And the next day he tried to do it again, and they
                    didn't let him even open his mouth.</p>
                <p>Then he got on a roof in a helicopter with too many people in it anleft, and he
                    got away from there, and they captured him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It had too many people and so it landed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: It landed farther up-country, yes. But they captured him, put him in a
                    tank, he and his wife in a tank. He's reported to have had a wristwatch that was
                    in contact with the Securitat that he could beam where he was at all times. They
                    put him in a tank; they couldn't get him.</p>
                <p>Then he was tried, and his wife was tried - and that's in the tape,it's dramatic
                    pictures - and taken out and shot.</p>
                <pb facs="0220" n="Page0220"/>
                <p>You know, here's a story on this thing. I knew that he and his wife had been
                    shot, and I fully approved of it. Cutting off the head of the snake is what
                    you're doing. And they immediately passed a law against capital punishment after
                    they'd done that. But they had to get rid of those two.</p>
                <p>But I went down in the bowels of the chancellery building. I'll have to go back
                    to this to do it, but we had gotten the convoy with the people out, and I should
                    tell you about that at some time, but this will fill in at this time- because
                    it's so typically Balkan. You could call it that. They had on Romanian
                    television immediately these little cartoons, Looney Tunes and things. I mean,
                    you can imagine what the people thought - they were just going crazy seeing
                    things like that on television after 50 years of this other stuff. This was
                    Christmas, and I remember I said to the Marines, “Have they shown the bodies of
                    Ceausescu and Elena yet?”</p>
                <p>“No.”</p>
                <p>So I started shouting at the T.V. - show the bodies!!!.</p>
                <p>Let me try to give you a feeling of what I think for me was the most dramatic
                    night of the revolution - December 24, 1989 - To my immense relief the convoy
                    had arrived safely in Ruse, Bulgaria. The convoy consisted of non-essential
                    Embassy personnel, a few U.S. citizens still in Romania, Canadians, Jewish and
                    Japanese Embassy staffers - Joan and Mary Napper made the trip to Bulgaria.</p>
                <p>This day the terrorists trashed the British Ambassador's home - Michael and
                    Veronica Atkinson with their two teenagers (”home” for Christmas) and the other
                    British Nationals and staffers arrived at the U.S. Chancellory - Veronica
                    Atkinson had a narrow escape through the basement window with the help of a
                    German Embassy lady who lived next door. Veronica was shook up - we gave her a
                    sleeping pill and made her comfortable in Larry Napper's office.</p>
                <p>We established an open telephone line between my office and the White House
                    situation room - no easy task in 1989. One of my people constantly manned the
                    phone and every three minutes or so would say “Bucharest calling Washington.”
                    They would reply - we, therefore, knew the line was open. I was trying to get
                    some rest in my office when I heard my guy say “Washington calling Bucharest.”
                    He'd been on duty too long - we shortened the telephone working hours.</p>
                <pb facs="0221" n="Page0221"/>
                <p>I was called to the phone twice: 1) Defense Department told me the Defense
                    Department was paying for the phone hook-up - not out of our State Department
                    budget - I thanked the friendly voice. 2) The President of the United States
                    called me. He started off “Punch - if I'd known you were going to act this fast,
                    I would have sent you out sooner.” - We chuckled together. I asked President
                    Bush to speak to Larry Napper. Larry had never spoken to a President before. I
                    then told President Bush that Ambassador Atkinson was standing near me and I had
                    offered the British safety in the Chancellory - I asked the President if this
                    was okay - he said “Of course.” I am told the President had a big grin on his
                    face when he turned the phone over to an aide.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Q: Today is June 4, 1999. Let's pick up the subject you were pointing out that we
                    did jump over, and that's how you set things up for leaving.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, I'd like to do that because it was important to me that my affairs,
                    personal and financial, I could be at ease with that while I wrestled with the
                    problems of, as far as I was concerned, living behind the Iron Curtain.</p>
                <p>So special mention has to be made of my daughter Kelsey Grout, who did with
                    loving care those scrapbooks over there that you haven't looked at yet, but
                    they're - I mean, it's got everything; it's just amazing. And also she took care
                    of the binders and all that, presented that at Christmas to me, and watched the
                    house and things like that. And Lord knows nobody loves their daughters more
                    than I do, and I've got a wonderful pillow that they presented to me that
                    “Anybody can be a father, but very few people can be a Dad.” And I'm not trying
                    to single one out, but one lived in Chicago and one lived in Minneapolis, so
                    Kelsey was the one in Portland. And also her husband John Grout has the ability
                    as a contractor, small contractor, to do a lot of these things and look out for
                    things. So that was a great comfort level.</p>
                <p>And there was one person, from a personal standpoint, who I just took my papers
                    to - and my affairs, not to be too specific - but I was in a very liquid form. I
                    mean, I don't have any businesses anymore. It's either stocks, bonds or cash,
                    really, and with no debt.</p>
                <p>But it had to be watched. And I have some professionals which I will mention
                    briefly, but there was one guy in particular that I went to and laid it all out
                    and asked him just to spend a little time each month on it for me, and that was
                    Roger Meier, who is my lifelong friend. And he did it for me, and I felt very
                    comfortable with his surveillance - I've never been able to - I've tried to
                    think of some way I could really thank him - some present or something I could
                    give him, but it's not necessary. The friendship's that close.</p>
                <p>I had the pleasure and honor of sponsoring him for Waverley CountrClub, and I
                    think he appreciated that as much as anything.</p>
                <pb facs="0222" n="Page0222"/>
                <p>But anyway, when you've got a guy that's handling the Oregoinvestments, I guess
                    he could handle my stuff all right.</p>
                <p>And then of course at the First National Bank there was a fellow named Grant
                    Stebner. Now, there's an 11-hour time difference between Bucharest and Portland,
                    Oregon, and I'm the type of person that sometimes I'd get reports, regular
                    reports from Grant, they'd finally make it over to me, and I'd usually look at
                    them on a Saturday or a Sunday, and I would try to figure out the right time to
                    call him, but invariably I wouldn't because I was in a hurry to do something
                    else.</p>
                <p>So at Grant's retirement party, I was back in Portland and had retired from the
                    State Department - and his wife Susan came up to me and she said, “Well, Punch,
                    at least we knew one thing: when the phone rang at three o'clock in the morning
                    it wasn't a death in the family.” Which I thought was a wonderful remark on her
                    part.</p>
                <p>And then of course we had Norb Wellman of Ferguson Wellman - well, Ferguson
                    Wellman, and others, they were handling it, and also Price Waterhouse were
                    there. So they were all there for me, and so I was very comfortable that my
                    affairs were under control with talented people.</p>
                <p>But I wanted to mention that because it was important to me and - you know, a lot
                    of people don't think of things of this type but you have to think of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a conflict of interest concerns in setting
                        things ulike that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, I did. And the FMC, I thought I did. I had a small investment in the
                    Global Marine, they call it. Apparently they build these huge oil things that go
                    out in the gulf and suck the oil out of the ocean, and they were questioning
                    that a little bit, and I said, “Forget it, sell it.” And I sold it, and there
                    wasn't very much of it. Matter of fact, I'm glad I did; it went down quite a bit
                    since I sold it.</p>
                <p>But no, I never really did because I was mainly in - you know, I mean, it was
                    Comp Care and things, and then I had a lot of municipal bonds and - because I
                    just don't want to go back to work, and I think that municipal bonds are a good
                    safe investment. Then of course the others are mainly as a result of I've been
                    back 10 years and I've accumulated a lot - some of it Joanie had, but there
                    wasn't any real conflict when you're in Bucharest.</p>

                    of Portland bonds, and I had to call up Norb Wellman and tell him to get rid of
                    my Port of Portland bonds. I'd forgotten that. I said, “Sell those; I can't own

                        bodies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: As I said, I went up from the chancellery cellar after I finally saw the
                    bodies on television, when I was with the off-duty Marines way down in the
                    bowels of the chancellery, I went upstairs because I wanted to see if there was
                    a reaction by the public - because I knew this was the first the public, the
                    Romanian public, had seen of this dead tyrant and his wife.</p>
                <p>As I say, I looked outside my window and these armed Marines were right there,
                    and they said - I'd like to have a nickel for every time one of the Marines
                    said, “Mr. Ambassador, would you please stand away from the window, Sir.”</p>
                <p>But anyway, I peeked out as much as I could, and the people were celebrating
                    very, very much - I mean, it was just wild. As I mentioned, the guy across the
                    street, I didn't even know that there was an apartment over there, but it was
                    kind of eye-level to where I was, and you could see this guy comes out in his
                    undershirt and things like that with a bottle of vodka, and he's been drinking
                    it pretty heavily. But there was a real general celebration.</p>
                <p>Then in the days following and things like that there was a government grocery
                    store that was a little bit away from us, and they were issuing the stuff out to
                    the people, and you'd see them go by with a dozen loaves of bread. And they were
                    buying not for themselves only; I mean, they were buying for the whole family.
                    You'd see people walk by with eggs, four or five dozen eggs. You'd think, “Boy,
                    I hope he doesn't trip,” type of thing and all of that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>I saw a little girl walk by with a proverbial orange, and it's true, she'd never
                    seen an orange before, I guess. You hear that story, but I actually did see it
                    happen.</p>
                <pb facs="0224" n="Page0224"/>
                <p>And they brought - on the night of - well, the 17th to the 20th, in that area,
                    Securitat came out at night. Came out of the tunnels underneath the city; that's
                    where a lot of them lived - very nicely, but it doesn't sound like it. Sounds
                    like a submarine or something, but it's not. I mean, they had all sorts of
                    things in the tunnel, and they came out, and apparently they had AK's, loaded
                    AK's with shopping bags over the barrels they came out, and then they just shot
                    into the crowds wantonly.</p>
                <p>A couple of days later the people were outside the embassy, and they wanted the
                    ambassador. And there was a dead body of a young man there. And it was fairly
                    safe with people around me for me to go out, and I decided I should go. I hate
                    to see dead bodies.</p>
                <p>But anyway, so I went. But I remember an interesting young man who spoke English,
                    he said, “Now it's the United States' turn to do something for Romania.”</p>
                <p>And I turned to him, and I don't know why I thought of it at the time, but I
                    turned to him, and I said, “We will help you, but you'll have to help
                    yourselves. It won't help if you just think we're going to do it. It's not like
                    that. We can't afford to do it anymore.” And I said, “We'll help you get to a
                    free market economy if you want to get to a free market economy. But it's up to
                    you; it's not up to me.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You used the term “free market economy?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, I did. And I used it all throughout after that. It just started to
                    come to me, and I thought it was a good term to use, and I liked it.</p>
                <p>And then I got off the hearse, so to speak, truck, and then they wenon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, they had stopped there with the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. They stopped in front and demanded that I come out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a victim of the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Of the shooting of that night. As I understand it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to the Securitat?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0225" n="Page0225"/>
                <p>GREEN: The Securitat? Now, I'll tell you something. Before the revolution, before
                    the - well, say before the 25th or 24th of December, you'd see these little
                    Jeep-type cars all over Bucharest, and they all said Securitat on them, and
                    there were Securitat people inside.</p>
                <p>The next day, it was amazing, they all disappeared. Nobody can tell me they can't
                    operate fast when they have to. They appeared the next day, even, with Policia
                    substituted for the dreaded word Securitat, which I thought was an interesting
                    thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they actually adopted [indiscernible]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. It was the same people. They just used that word instead of
                    Securitat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there [indiscernible]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I thought there would be. Yes, there was some, but not much, no. Not much.
                    Everybody was pretty stunned, I think, by it. There was a lot of things to put
                    together. A lot of people were looking at their own role in this thing.</p>
                <p>You've got to realize that everybody in Romania was a registereCommunist or
                    whatever you want if they wanted to live.</p>
                <p>I wonder if this is a time I could bring up the Broadway play Les Miserables? It
                    happened later on, but the reason I bring it up at this time...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, do that now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. At this time Ginny Young came to see me, and she said - this is
                    probably - and Ginny was, as I say, I'm not sure how much on a personal basis
                    she particularly liked me, but that's all right, she was a professional. And she
                    came to see the ambassador. She knew I was close to George Bush. She said, “This
                    is kind of the last shot I've got. We've got about 1600, 1700” - let's settle on
                    1663 because it was an odd number; I'm not sure exactly what it was, but I think
                    it's in there somewhere - but anyway, “ - of people we call “The Miserables.”
                    They have one crime they had committed under the Ceausescu regime.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “What was that?”</p>
                <p>“They wanted to be Americans. They were willing to give up everything.” And these
                    were professors; there were some peasants, but they were mainly professors,
                    doctors, and the type of people who any country would be lucky to get.</p>
                <pb facs="0226" n="Page0226"/>
                <p>And I said, “Well, Ginny, I don't know.”</p>
                <p>I think this is the thing I'm the most proud of having participated in, and
                    frankly I don't think it would have happened if I hadn't been there.</p>
                <p>And so I said, “Ginny, I tell you what you do. Why don't you get - have you got a
                    board there of these people, of maybe leaders of these people, who can meet with
                    me?” I said, “If they'll meet with me, and if they speak English, I could get
                    this thing started.” And we did.</p>
                <p>To make a long story short, we met in the annex, talked about it. And I said,
                    “Well, I can't, you know, promise anything, I wouldn't have any idea, but I'll
                    keep trying.”</p>
                <p>And I met with them again because Ginny kept on me because I kept their spirit
                    up. There's nothing like keeping hope and spirit up in people - that's what
                    people live for.</p>
                <p>So I was recalled to Washington, DC because Ion Iliescu, who was the president of
                    the country, had gone down and thanked the miners for coming to town after
                    they'd trashed the town, and that made all of the world news, and you know, our
                    government was mad about it. I was mad about it. He'd been elected, but he
                    hadn't been inaugurated yet.</p>
                <p>And so I went back to Washington, DC in protest. They recalled me in protest to
                    the leadership. They didn't like the way the election had gone. Actually, I
                    think Washington was wrong, the election had gone rather well, I mean
                    considering it was the first election they'd ever had. But they - Washington
                    itself hadn't had much experience with these elections behind the curtain.
                    Romania, really, when you think about it, it was the first free election they'd
                    had, one of the first.</p>
                <p>So anyway, so I went back and I let the President know I was in town, and he
                    wanted to have dinner on Sunday night with me, as I recall. And I told Dot
                    Evans, my secretary, to get a hold of Joan who was out of country. I couldn't
                    even - you know, I had no chance to get a hold of anybody. And Joanie at that
                    time was in Paris and on her way to visit the Irish ambassador, and you might be
                    interesting to talk to Ester Jantzen Moore. Richard Moore was the Ambassador to
                    Ireland.</p>
                <p>So anyway, I told Jim Baker, or I told the people, Ray Sykes, I think, mainly,
                    who went on to become Ambassador to Great Britain, the Court of St. James, I
                    said to him what I wanted to do. I said, “I want to get “The Miserables” to the
                    attention of the President.”</p>
                <p>And they okayed it. What I wanted to do was I wanted to bring to the attention of
                    the President the plight of these 1683 people, and was there anything he could
                    do about it, or should I just drop it. But I thought it would be something that
                    would appeal to President Bush.</p>
                <pb facs="0227" n="Page0227"/>
                <p>But this, you see, involves not only the State Department, it involves the
                    Treasury Department, and they have a branch in Rome, and they had to come up to
                    Bucharest - four or five of them had to come up and check and set up a thing in
                    our consulate where we had the passports and all that. It was quite an
                    operation. Doesn't happen very often in government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean they sent an officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: They sent about four or five officers to Bucharest.</p>
                <p>But anyway, so what I did was, the morning of that meeting with Bush, that
                    dinner, I sat down with hotel stationery and wrote the whole thing out. And then
                    I went down and made a copy of it, and I think I've got it in there somewhere. I
                    hope so.</p>
                <p>I then went to see him, and I had warned that I wanted to talk to him personally.
                    So there were a bunch of people. We saw a movie. It was a lousy movie. And then
                    he said, “I won't talk to you now. I'm going to see you later on.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Fine, Mr. President.”</p>
                <p>So we went upstairs, and there again was Brent Scowcroft. He's on the right side,
                    and the President's on the left side of me, and they take me over to this chair,
                    both of them. And I bring out this hotel stationery with my notes, and I go over
                    briefly with him what the problem is, and I said, “It would be a fantastic thing
                    to do, and this country would be blessed if these people became citizens - they
                    want to be Americans, that's all.” And I went through this whole litany.</p>
                <p>And I handed my written stuff to the President. The President went like this,
                    Jim: He nodded his head. That's all he did, to Brent Scowcroft, and then he
                    handed the papers that I had given him to Brent Scowcroft.</p>
                <p>And then we had dinner, and nothing else further was said about it. But the next
                    day I went in to see somebody, and somebody from CIA was there, and they brought
                    out my notes. And I said, “Is this thing going to be possible?”</p>
                <p>They said, “Well, you got the nod from the right guy.”</p>
                <p>So I just felt great.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the President doing - he didn't want to commit
                        himself?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0228" n="Page0228"/>
                <p>GREEN: No, he didn't want to commit himself. He nodded to his right-hand man. He
                    said, “I want this done.” I mean, a President can do it, if he wants to. And
                    people will do it, if they want to.</p>
                <p>But anyway, so I went back to Bucharest and we went through all of this stuff.
                    And then, to make a long story short, Treasury came to Bucharest, and these
                    people were - and not all of them were taken, but 95 percent of them were. Some
                    of them were phonies, and you know, they heard about it and tried to cheat</p>
                <p>So they did a good job. So the “miserable Board” came by to see me, and I don't
                    know why I said this, at the end we were talking and they were, you know, crying
                    and - you know, tears in their eyes. And I said to them, I said, “You know,
                    America's a tough country. This is a tough country, but America's a tough
                    country. You're going in there, we have gangs, we have as many pistols and
                    firearms as you've got over here.” And I said, “Play the buddy system. One
                    person's out of a job, help that person out till they get a job. Just stay
                    together as best you can. Get a buddy and work a buddy system.” And I said, “My
                    ancestors I'm sure did that, and that's how America was established.”</p>
                <p>But I said, “There's one thing I want you to know.” And all these people, they
                    didn't have any money, you know. And I said, “I'm a businessman, and I don't do
                    anything free.” Just dead silence. And one of them said, “What do you mean, Mr.
                    Ambassador?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, I've got a price for all of this that I've done foyou.”</p>
                <p>And they said to me, “What is it?”</p>
                <p>And I said, “That you be good Americans.” And their reaction waamazing.</p>
                <p>Two days later - we always had a demonstration every day in front of the
                    chancellery and my car was always parked there, and the demonstrators were
                    across the street. And they'd have signs up and things like that. And Paneit was
                    driving me to the residence where I'd get a little rest, and he looked across
                    the street and he said, “Mr. Ambassador, look at that.”</p>
                <p>And I looked across the street, and there was this big sign in English, “Mr.
                    Ambassador, we will be good Americans.” And there was about 50 of them, I
                    guess.</p>
                <p>And then I went out to see them off, too, at the airport, and the place was just
                    jammed. I got way up and wished them “Noroc” Romanian for luck -</p>
                <p>But I've often thought, I said, “If I do nothing else in my life, that has to be
                    the most significant action colloquial in which I have ever participated.”</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These people had suffered?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: They had lost everything. They were living with relatives. They'd lost
                    their coupons to buy food. They'd lost everything. They couldn't hold a job.
                    Only because of one thing, they wanted to be American and that was their whole
                    crime. That was everything. And Ceausescu considered them traitors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Seems like they made a mistake. Did they suddenly all get
                        caughdoing it...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, it continued. No, it wasn't like that at all. This wabefore my time.
                    Ginny Young would be able to tell you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you hear from these people afterwards?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, I didn't. And I'll tell you, if you look up my number in the phone
                    book, you'll find my name but no address, and I'm hard to find. There's no
                    Punch; it's Alan or A. Green or something. I was getting a lot of screwy phone
                    calls when I got home, and I just thought, “Okay, I've done my bit now.” (End of
                    tape)</p>
                <p>When I was awarded Distinguished Honor Award, I wanted very much for President
                    Bush to give me the Distinguished Honor award, for him to actually present it to
                    me. So I wrote him a note, and he wrote me back suggesting - well, actually it's
                    not that high of an award, I don't think, for a President to give. I didn't know
                    at the time - but he suggested that either Jim Baker or Larry Eagleburger give
                    it when I came home. I wanted to do it when I came home rather than do it in
                    Bucharest because most of the people who had helped me had gone out on rotation
                    and new people had come in.</p>
                <p>So I got a call from somebody in the State Department, one of the guys on the
                    seventh floor that made calls like this, and he said, “Mr. Ambassador, what we'd
                    like to do is - congratulations on receiving, et cetera, et cetera - what we'd
                    like to do is we'd like to have this presentation in Bucharest.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Well, there won't be many people here in Bucharest thaparticipated
                    with me while it happened.”</p>
                <p>And he said, “Well, we decided we'd like to do it in Bucharest.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, that's interesting. I've got a letter here from the President of
                    the United States suggesting that Jim Baker or Larry Eagleburger present it to
                    me.”</p>
                <pb facs="0230" n="Page0230"/>
                <p>“Well, forget it, Sir. We'll be happy to do it in Washington, DC.” And he hung
                    up. That shows the power of the Presidency. It's incredible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if we could get back to Iliescu. All of a sudden
                        you'rdealing with...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I'm dealing with Ion Iliescu. Q: What history do you have with Ion
                    Iliescu?</p>
                <p>GREEN: None. He was - but I knew one thing, he had the guts to stand up to
                    Ceausescu, and he was high in the government. And instead of being put in prison
                    or something of that type he was the- [Interruption]</p>
                <p>My understanding is that he stood up to Ceausescu, and because he would disagree
                    with him, he was - he wasn't sent to prison, but he was sent to a very minor
                    post in - oh, I don't know, a printing plant or something like that,
                    communications, something like that, in Bucharest, but it was very minor. And
                    then when it happened, the various skills kind of got together, “Here, you know
                    something about money, you're the Treasurer,” you know. Everything was
                    appointed.</p>
                <p>I think Iliescu did a fine job in bringing everything together. They had a lot of
                    other minority parties, but the National Salvation Front, they were the ones who
                    were united enough to form a political party in Romania right after the
                    revolution. All it took to officially form a political party was about 200
                    people, and hell, you can find that in a family.</p>
                <p>So it was ridiculous. So that's why the Front won such a large majority. But
                    Iliescu at the time - I remember going over to see him in overcoats we'd had at
                    the time because it was very cold - in the winter of '89-90 there had been a
                    terrific blizzard, and it helped the revolution a lot because it made it very
                    difficult for the Securitat to get around.</p>
                <p>I remember going to see him late at night, and we'd sit there drinking this
                    coffee, and everybody had their overcoats on and hats and things like that in
                    these conferences. And I remember saying to him once, with Larry Napper; I
                    always had people with me - I remember saying to him, I said, “Mr. President,
                    you know, I've never -” and he understood English, incidentally, but he had an
                    interpreter there with him at all times, which was helpful. But I said, “You
                    know, I've never met anybody that had a chance to do more good than you have
                    now. To me it's just awe inspiring. If there's anything I can do to help you, I
                    want to do it.”</p>
                <p>And he got mad - which surprised me. I wasn't expecting that reaction at all. And
                    he simply misunderstood what I'd said in some way. He thought I was being
                    critical of him or something I'd said about him, which, of course, was totally
                    untrue. - He spoke good English.</p>
                <pb facs="0231" n="Page0231"/>
                <p>But over time we became quite close. When I came back from my recall - and I may
                    have these events a little bit misconstrued, and I apologize to you if I do
                    because it all happened fast. But when I came back I was the only ambassador who
                    did not go to his inauguration, and that had them very upset. But I was upset
                    with them, too, and Jim Baker and the President, the administration was upset
                    because of this manner in which it was conceived that they had reacted toward
                    rewarding the destructive miners.</p>
                <p>And so I remember being over to - going over to the fellow in television, I
                    forget who he was - I know one thing, he had a television set on behind him, and
                    it had the damnedest nude dirty movie on I'd ever seen, and it was very
                    difficult for me to concentrate on what I was saying to him. He let it run
                    throughout the whole interview.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I don't know. Maybe he liked it, and maybe it was to see what my reaction
                    would be. I have no idea. I didn't give him the pleasure of that. I just - I
                    watched it when he was talking and I didn't understand what he was saying. I
                    said nothing to him. I wasn't going to play into his deal.</p>
                <p>But anyway, I do remember that. He got a call from Iliescu. He put the phone down
                    after he got through and said, “Do you know who that was?” And I said, “No.” He
                    was speaking Romanian on the phone. He said, “That was the President. He'd like
                    very much to see you. Is that possible?”</p>
                <p>I said, “I think it's possible.”</p>
                <p>So what I did was I sat down with Larry Napper, and we outlined a statement - we
                    didn't outline a statement, we wrote exactly what I was going to say, and then I
                    made a copy of it, and when we went over and got together with President Iliescu
                    - it was a very ticklish meeting. It was the first time the United States met
                    with Romania, you know, since the inauguration - I mean, with the President.
                    We'd met before, but I mean since the inauguration, let's put it that way, his
                    inauguration.</p>
                <p>And I read it to him. I said, “I'm doing it this way so that there isn't any
                    misunderstanding, and if I go along and I don't - and I want to add something to
                    it, I'll say, 'I'm adding to this, Mr. President, if that's all right with
                    you.'” And it was fine with him. So we went through that exercise, and it worked
                    out very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the message?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0232" n="Page0232"/>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, the message was we want to get together, I suppose, and yes, we want
                    to help you, and we don't like this that happened, this is the reason we didn't
                    like you going down to see the miners at the railroad station, it looked like
                    you were congratulating the miners for all this damage that was done, and things
                    of that sort.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's go back and pick up that story of the problem of approaching the
                    election and what were the issues there and how they were responding and how
                    well they were listening to you and so forth. In dealing with them and talking
                    to them about the upcoming elections, what were you saying to them?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, you know, number one, “Yes, we're the United States of America, yes,
                    we're important to the future of any of these countries, but it's their country.
                    So you can only say so much without them misinterpreting, looking like you're
                    being heavy on them.</p>
                <p>I remember receiving an absentee ballot from Oregon, and I took it over to the
                    foreign minister, and I said, “This may help you with your coming election. I
                    think it's illegal for me to do this, but I want to do it anyway just so you can
                    see how we work it in the United States for the people who are out of the
                    country, or in the Merchant Marine or Navy or something like that, so they can
                    vote if they're not home.”</p>
                <p>I don't know if they used it or not, but it gave them an idea. And apparently I
                    was forgiven by the government of the state of Oregon. I never heard from them
                    on this matter.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I remember there were people from the United States constantly coming in
                    looking for troubles. “It can't be the way you're saying it is,” that sort of
                    thing. I'm the type of person that looks optimistically at something; I don't
                    look pessimistically at things. And I suppose that really I was wrong in a few
                    things, but not in the important stuff. They were making a sincere effort to
                    have a free and fair election. That was the whole - those were the key words, “a
                    free and fair election.”</p>
                <p>So there was tremendous preparation for it, and I had a governor - I think from
                    New Mexico - who came over who was the President's personal observer. The polls
                    were supposed to close at 8:00 at night. We started at about 5:00 in the morning
                    and went way out in the country, you know, looked at things. We even got inside
                    an army post, if you can believe it. I demanded - because I was supposed to have
                    free access to anything to see if it was being done fairly, freely and fairly.
                    And I said, “Let's try that.” And it took us about half an hour to get inside,
                    but we got inside. I don't know, maybe they prepared a few things and put up a
                    few posters during that half hour, I don't know. But the fact is - it doesn't
                    make much difference - the fact is we got inside. I mean, to me that was
                    terrific, and the governor agreed.</p>
                <pb facs="0233" n="Page0233"/>
                <p>But everybody - it was a hot day. It was May, I think, and everybody was dressed
                    in their best suit and best dress. And at eight o'clock at night when we were at
                    the official closing hour - a lot of churches were their polling places. - You
                    know, and there was no way these people were going to be deprived of their vote.
                    They'd never voted before, most of them.</p>
                <p>So they left it open, and I think wisely. And I think they voted all night. And
                    then it was overwhelmingly Iliescu was elected. He was just appointed, first. I
                    mean, I don't know who appointed him; maybe this group that came up after the
                    revolution. Those things just kind of grow like Topsy, you know. But I think
                    they were lucky to have him. They have replaced him. He's not there as we
                    talk.</p>
                <p>They had some marvelous people. You'll see them there. You'll see Adrian Nastase,
                    for example. He's the foreign minister. And there was a wonderful guy in there
                    whose wife was the TV commentator on Romanian television. I liked him a lot. He
                    had an American sense of humor. Romanescu, I think. Might have been. But anyway,
                    he's identified in there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were pretty sure that the elections were really
                        free anfair?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, sure. Of course, I got chewed out by Jim Baker. I never could figure
                    it out. Someday I'm going to ask him. But apparently he'd got word that, “Gee,
                    that's a nice guy you've got out in Bucharest, but he's too nice a guy; you need
                    somebody tougher.” You know. And I - you know, the medal and all of that defies
                    that, but that was before all of that was given.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Someone said that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: In State, on the seventh floor, some people don't like non-career people.
                    I mean, and here I was right in the middle of this thing, and I wasn't one of
                    them. They would have sent a career guy if they'd had any idea. Jim Baker was
                    laughing when he said, “We're going to get him in good time,” but you know.
                    There wasn't any research behind that.</p>
                <p>So I think there was a lot of that involved there. But anyway, Jim probably
                    tested me out a lot. Because Ray Sykes, who I mentioned earlier, went on to the
                    Court of St. James, he was a witness to this chewing out I was getting from
                    Jim.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [indiscernible]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, he was kind of tough. He said, “What do you think a free and fair
                    election is?” And I said, “I think you just saw one.” I said, “I don't know,
                    58-42? Is that a free and fair election? I don't know. I can't tell you what a
                    free and fair election is.”</p>
                <pb facs="0234" n="Page0234"/>
                <p>And then I made a mistake. I said, “I'll tell you one thing, it's a hell of a lot
                    better than the Landside Lyndon thing you had in Texas not long ago, and this is
                    the first election they've ever had.”</p>
                <p>And he said, “I'm not talking about that.” He knocked that one off fast. And he
                    was kind of the boss, you know. But anyway, he got rid of saying it, and I
                    answered him as best I could. I almost offered to resign at the time, as a
                    matter of fact. I thought about it, and I said, “Well, if they're not satisfied”
                    - and then I said, “I've got a lot of work involved in this thing, and I am
                    doing a good job. I'm going to stay. They're going to have to ask me.” And they
                    never did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What else did he say to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, it was mainly a discussion of a free and fair election because I
                    think it was one of the first, and I think he was upset with it. I don't think
                    he thought it was. And he didn't like Iliescu. Now, I'll tell you an interesting
                    thing. After the Bush people were out of office and I'm in the desert, I'm at
                    this party with Jim Baker, and Jim Baker said, “Guess who I had dinner with a
                    month ago?” And I said, “Who?”</p>
                <p>“Ion Iliescu. He's an awfully nice guy, isn't he?”</p>
                <p>And he was out of office and all that. I mean, it was interesting. I said, “Well,
                    I tried to tell you that, you know, when I was ambassador, but you said you
                    wouldn't have any part of it at that time.”</p>
                <p>And he said, “Yes.” He didn't make any apology, and he shouldn't. He was a
                    magnificent Secretary of State, and Larry Eagleburger was. The combination of
                    George Bush, Jim Baker and Larry Eagleburger, it's hard to duplicate.</p>
                <p>Q: One of the things that shows up in your letters home is the point of access to
                    television. Were those the kinds of points that they were making when they were
                    talking about free elections?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, that was one of the things. It was one of the troubles in the other
                    countries. But they had one national television that was run by the government.
                    The government was the front. And I agreed with our government, we should get -
                    the lesser parties should have access to television, also. It's difficult to get
                    that concept into these people who have lived entirely differently. A free
                    market economy were words to them, didn't mean anything to them.</p>
                <pb facs="0235" n="Page0235"/>
                <p>So but we did, we made some breakthroughs in that. But it can't be done
                    immediately, now they've got television, I think. They've got an independent
                    television, and you've got all sorts of things over there. But it takes time.
                    This thing is done within six months of the revolution. You can't do - you can't
                    redo 50 years in six months. It's going to be generations before these people
                    really understand what a great thing they've got.</p>
                <p>Q: Also, the other parties, opposition parties, I noticed again and again that
                    every time you did something public which connected you with the government, you
                    visited the opposition party.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Immediately. Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you tell me what the plan was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, it just said that we didn't show preference towards any one person,
                    any one party. And we weren't. I mean - and that's the main reason you did these
                    things.</p>
                <p>When you're the United States, you've got to be careful. You're the leader. You
                    go to a cocktail party, for example, you're talking to some leader of one of the
                    minority parties, and you go and you leave, and somebody comes very quickly over
                    from another party, wants exactly the equal time with the United States
                    ambassador. I mean, I don't want to mention other countries, but if you're some
                    other countries, it doesn't make that much difference. But anything you say you
                    know is going to make their cable that night. And it's kind of - it's wonderful
                    in a way, but it's scary, too. You have to be careful.</p>
                <p>I remember once there was a little fellow at a cocktail party, I liked him very
                    much. I didn't know who he was. And then they eased me away from him. I said,
                    “Why are you doing that?”</p>
                <p>“He's the ambassador from Albania. We don't recognize Albania.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Oh.”</p>
                <p>And then the fellow approached me another night, and I said, “I can't talk to
                    you. We don't recognize you.” And I thought he was going to cry. I said, “I'm
                    awful sorry, but those are the rules, and you know it.” It was too much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: National Salvation Front...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: They had none - because they had a lot of egos involved. They wanted to
                    head up their party. I said, “Don't do it that way. Pick one person and then
                    combine, have one party. Then you've got a chance to get things elected.”</p>
                <pb facs="0236" n="Page0236"/>
                <p>And Jim Baker said exactly the same thing when he finally visited - when he came
                    to Bucharest. And he said to the minority parties, we had them all sitting
                    around the dining room table at the residence, and he said exactly the same
                    thing to them, “Combine, combine, get everything together, join together and
                    have your political party as the Republicans do, different Republicans, and
                    Democrats do.” You've just got a mess when you've got a third party. Look what
                    Ross Perot did. Here you've got 20 parties, and one - the National Salvation
                    Front, which, you know, is going to get 85 percent of the vote. And they do,
                    they control the television. Every once in a while you'll get a little in T.V.
                    But later on it worked out with more equal coverage.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, is this strategy out of the State Department that an ambassador like you
                    is instructed to work with minority parties like this?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. Sure. But instructions - I don't remember ever receiving those
                    instructions. It was something you naturally did, and when you'd talk to them on
                    the telephone and things of that sort, you'd kind of discuss it, and they'd say,
                    “Yes, we're doing that.” And we just automatically did it. It wasn't, “You do
                    this, and if you don't do this you are in trouble.” There's very little of
                    that.</p>
                <p>One thing I will say about - and this is government, I guess - this is during the
                    Gulf War, but we ought to talk about the Gulf War, too; that's a big item over
                    there, and the adoptions and all of that. But maybe that has to be for a later
                    date, if you don't mind.</p>
                <p>But anyway, you'd get these cables, and you'd read them - and I actually agreed
                    with the cables I was receiving, but I noticed, and I would chuckle, as a matter
                    of fact, at the end of the cable was kind of a disclaimer: “If it doesn't work
                    out, it's your problem.” [laughs] But that's okay. That's okay. You're out
                    there. I mean, you should know. I mean, the disclaimer really makes a lot of
                    sense because you're the one that's on the scene, you ought to know; somebody
                    sitting in Washington, DC really doesn't know. I mean, he's not there. I didn't
                    mind it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These parties: Peasant Party, Liberal Party, Social
                        Democrat...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Right. Social Democrat. Farmers. They had long histories; some of them had
                    long histories. You've got to remember, Romania between the wars had a monarchy.
                    It had a middle class, it had a parliament, it had these things. Russia never
                    did. They went right from the Tsar to Communism. But Romanians had - some of the
                    older people remembered some of these institutions, and the Labor Party or the
                    Peasant Party or something like that had a long history going back, and they
                    were very proud of it, and they'd bring out some of these old people that were
                    involved in it, and you had to listen with respect to them. You knew who was
                    going to win, but you had to listen to them. And the changes. And then they had
                    this young guy, Roman, who I liked a lot. He was probably too fashionable and
                    things. He always dressed very well.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he politically connected to the National
                        Salvation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Not to them.</p>
                <p>Q: I think it would be good to have a narrative of the events of the - just after
                    the election. The mid-June events of the miners and so forth.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, just after the elections the miners came to town, and that's what
                    caused my being recalled to Washington. But the miners came to town, and it was
                    - they trashed one of the candidate's homes, and just generally - well, their
                    conditions were awful in the mine. Can you imagine being a miner in Romania,
                    coal miner in Romania under Ceausescu? I mean, it's not going to change much
                    because Ceausescu's not going to change... (End of tape)</p>
                <p>And it got a lot of press coverage around the world, the trashing oBucharest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Iliescu encourage them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, that wasn't apparent at the time, but I guess he did. This is after
                    the election - because he thought he wasn't going to be allowed to take office,
                    I guess. There was still all this paranoia going on, you know, from Ceausescu
                    days; the Russians are coming back and everything else. It wasn't exactly stable
                    times.</p>
                <p>So what really kicked it was when the miners finally left Bucharest by train, and
                    Iliescu went down and thanked them. And that of course made headlines around the
                    world, and that's what caused my recall in protest. Iliescu never admitted he
                    made a mistake doing that.</p>
                <p>They finally got some people around Iliescu who had been outside Romania, finally
                    got some advisors. And one of them - I can't think of his name, he was a big,
                    tall guy, and he'd been outside Romania and spent quite a bit of time. He'd been
                    a water polo player, superb water polo player. But he'd been outside Romania. He
                    knew what Paris looked like, he knew what New York looked like. These other
                    people didn't have any idea, and you couldn't blame them, if you didn't have
                    that experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You actually tried to tell Iliescu - give him some
                        exampleof... Did he catch on to what you were trying to tell him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0238" n="Page0238"/>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, I think he probably did, but I think eventually he came over to our
                    thinking. I'd kind of forgotten that. You're right, I did say those things to
                    him. But I don't know whether he did or not. He was not reelected, but I don't
                    think the miner incident had anything to do with it. It was just that people
                    expected more. They expected the United States to do more, the Marshall Plan,
                    they thought everything was going to be done. And I said, “We can't do it
                    anymore. We can't afford it.” And I think their expectations were so high after
                    the revolution that everything was going to open up and it was going to be just
                    a golden - the hope was that gold would be coming down from the skies. It
                    doesn't work that way, as you know, as everybody knows. But reality finally set
                    in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [indiscernible]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, that young man with the dead body and the man turninto me, the young
                    man saying - and then my response to him.</p>
                <p>I remember the first party - after Joanie had come back the first party we gave
                    at the residence. You can imagine - it being the United States, not the fact
                    that I was giving the party, everybody in Bucharest wanted to be there. So we
                    had to be very careful about the invitations and all that.But the talk at that
                    time, and it was probably six, eight weeks after the revolution, you know,
                    wasn't realistic. I kept saying that, “It's not realistic. You've got to put out
                    your fires - you've got to do it yourselves. And then we'll help.”</p>
                <p>But I remember one man coming up to me, and he said, “Mr. Ambassador,do you have
                    a family?”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Yes, I have a wife, right over there, we've been married about
                    40-some-odd years, and three daughters, three sons-in-law and eight
                    grandchildren.”</p>
                <p>And he said to me, “You're a very wealthy man.”</p>
                <p>And you know, that's - I've never forgotten that. That's true. People think of
                    wealth, they think of money. It's not - that's not the case. If you don't have
                    the other, money doesn't mean anything.</p>
                <p>Have I described the revolution as much as...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Is there anything that...</p>
                <pb facs="0239" n="Page0239"/>
                <p>Q: I guess I just have a lingering question. When you talk about paranoia in the
                    country, your feelings about and concerns about where you were and where you
                    were going, were there times when you thought, “This is really kind of bad to be
                    traveling...”</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, there was one time where I really was worried. It was when - I never
                    saw such terror - or fear, I should say, in the eyes of our Foreign Service
                    Nationals - and I would judge a lot of this by the nationals, the foreign
                    service nationals that were - that are with the embassy. They're the
                    bureaucracy, and I should have mentioned them because they're wonderful people,
                    and they're employees of the United States government. As a matter of fact, let
                    me just go fly the flag. Why am I so favorably remembered by them; they think I
                    got them a big raise. Well, I had a girl there, Anita Booth, she suggested it to
                    me. She stayed during the revolution; I had to send her husband, Don, out.</p>
                <p>And she said, “You know” - and they were being paid maybe $200, $250 a month,
                    American. That's a lot of money over there, don't kid yourself. And the maids
                    and butler there, they were $150 a month and that sort of thing. I would bonus
                    them at Christmas from my personal funds.</p>
                <p>So anyway, Anita suggested to me it wouldn't cost the United States government a
                    dime more money if we'd pay them in dollars and not give it to them in the
                    official exchange. And I said, “You're absolutely right. I wish I'd thought of
                    that.”</p>
                <p>But anyway, we got it through like that. It didn't cost the taxpayer of my
                    country any more money, but they got it, you see, and they could - what
                    everybody else was doing, they took it out to the airport or elsewhere and got
                    the real exchange, instead of the official rate. That was a tremendous help to
                    them.</p>
                <p>So I was getting people - I could get anybody I wanted in the country ready to
                    work for me - I mean, as far as talent goes, and that was - I wasn't too popular
                    with some of the other Embassies because we did this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would be the problem with the other Embassies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, just - the dollar, the dollar was what everybody wanted.</p>
                <p>But I wanted to tell you about this. When Gorbachev came back from the Crimea,
                    the Romanians thought there was going to be a revolution in Russia and they
                    thought the Communists were coming back into power, my Foreign Service
                    nationals, and therefore the Romanian people felt this. They thought the
                    Russians were coming again, and you never saw such terror in people's eyes. You
                    couldn't blame them. And you'd say, “No, I don't think it will happen.” What can
                    I say, my living safely in Portland, Oregon in the immediate past.</p>

                    were really concerned about - you had a fear of violence coming - which kind of
                    surprised me.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Let me - this is an interesting anecdote.</p>
                <p>A lot of times things happen, and you get it settled without conflict. Therefore,
                    nobody knows about it.</p>
                <p>When this happened it was about a year after the revolution, Decembeof '90?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Okay. So I never liked particularly the leaders of the Romanian Orthodox
                    Church because they were with Ceausescu the whole time, they got his favors and
                    things like that, and they were soft. And they never really represented - helped
                    the people.</p>
                <p>But I will tell you the work after the revolution. I thought the Notre Dame
                    football team had arrived in Romania. I happen to be an Episcopalian. But these
                    priests that came in were big, tough looking guys, and they were taking over the
                    Catholic Churches, which were allowed of course to go to ruin, some had been
                    taken over by the Romanian Orthodox Church and that sort of thing. And these
                    guys were really something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did they come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: All over the world. Mostly Italy, I suppose. But they werbig guys.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Roman Catholic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Roman Catholics, yes. And the people were flocking to them. They have - a
                    Papal Nuncio, they call it, and that's their equivalent of the ambassador. He -
                    I can't think of his name, but I'm sure it's in the papers. There was a problem.
                    He hadn't called on me yet; he was new. But we got a very strong rumor that
                    there was going to be a demonstration with injuries and things like that and a
                    few heads being knocked together on the anniversary of the revolution, the first
                    year anniversary.</p>
                <p>And so we needed - from the State Department I needed a statement prior to this -
                    December 17th, I think was the date - prior to this date I needed a statement
                    that Romania was making good progress towards a free market economy, something
                    of that type from my State Department. And I got it. It was tough to get, too.
                    It wasn't easy at all. But we got it.</p>
                <pb facs="0241" n="Page0241"/>
                <p>And I went over to see the Papal Nuncio. I broke the rules; I went to see him.
                    And he spoke English because he'd taken his training in New Jersey. And I said
                    to him what I thought may occur - what our intelligence had told us. And I said,
                    “Let's see if we can stop this thing. And you could have a lot to do with it, if
                    you'll instruction your priests to mount the pulpits the Sunday before the 17th,
                    whatever it is, and tell them to have their demonstration, don't take that away
                    from them, but have a peaceful demonstration.”</p>
                <p>And he said, “I'll do it.” And they did it. And we hademonstrations, and they
                    were peaceful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the issue they were demonstrating over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, just - I don't know. It never occurred to me. You don't need an issue.
                    I mean, they weren't “down with this” or “down with that.” It was just, you
                    know, “Down with the Communists” or something, I suppose. But there were people
                    that - there are always people that don't - that aren't - you know, that can get
                    a frenzy going, and that's what happens.</p>
                <p>So I was very pleased with that because I said to the Papal Nuncio later on, I
                    said, “You know, we didn't make any headlines, but we won that one.”</p>
                <p>Q: You know, in the award statement that was treated seriously as a real threat.
                    Did you really have that feeling at the time that some real violence could
                    occur?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. And that's the reason I went to all this trouble.You bet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't localized; it was nationwide?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: It was probably localized. Most of that stuff is localized. The
                    revolution, basically - a lot of it, they didn't see much. Constanta didn't see
                    much. It was in Timisoara and Bucharest, really.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also at the time of the - just before the miners came in a
                        lot ostudents demonstrated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, all the time. All the time. Always - yes, I had to go to meetings
                    sometimes with the government. They'd let me through because of the American
                    flag and all of that, and they'd shake the car and drive Paneit crazy because he
                    was afraid they were going to snatch the flag. They never did. And I'd get out
                    and wade through the crowd and go up to these things. I could have been elected
                    president, I think, if I wanted to.</p>
                <pb facs="0242" n="Page0242"/>
                <p>And then I'd look out the windows. Once, I'll never forget it, it was just a sea
                    of people. And somebody said, “Mr. Ambassador, you should come over and look at
                    this.”</p>
                <p>There was a couple in a carriage that had just gotten married; she was in a
                    bridal gown. And they had this carriage up on their shoulders. They were passing
                    it on to the end of the crowd so the married couple could go on. I mean, it was
                    a wonderful sight.</p>
                <p>I mean, it was really - it was a demonstration, but it was also party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [indiscernible]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Sure. I mean, after a while, you know, things can get vertough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I found the note that I was looking for. You left in '91 -
                        no,you left in '92?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: In '92. January of '92.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. This was October of '91. You're saying there are
                        rumorof trouble and miners are...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: The miners came to town again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...and the odds seem to be shifting. That's why I was
                        thinking...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. Well...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...how volatile this all was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, I'll tell you, it was always there. I mean history haproven - it's
                    been ten years now that they're not communist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your public image?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I think it was good. I think it was very good. I was on Romanian
                    television a lot. They wanted the American ambassador on, and I'd grin as much
                    as I could for them because I think that's always helpful when you do it that
                    way, particularly when I'm not talking in their language.</p>
                <pb facs="0243" n="Page0243"/>
                <p>I mentioned the Minister's wife; she had interviewed me, and she could speak
                    English, and then they would interpret it, and we had a banter back and forth.
                    So it was within the country - because I'd go out of Bucharest, of course, quite
                    a bit, and I'd always have a great feeling of the people - you know, V signs
                    shown and they wanted to talk to the American ambassador. The American
                    ambassador. That's what it's all about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does that bother anybody at the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, not to my knowledge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the other embassies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Might have, a little. I don't think so. We were all kind of working this
                    thing together. I never bragged about it, I can tell you that. I mean, I never
                    said anything to anybody else, and they weren't with me, really. And they got
                    print, too. I was concerned about the Jews, and then we got over that. We let
                    them know that the United States would be extremely upset if anything happened
                    to that particular minority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you can tell me more about dealing with the
                        Jewish question.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, it wasn't as big as Rabbi Rosen made it to be. He was an old man. He
                    worried me a little bit. As I said, on about the third day of the revolution,
                    and the bullets were still going, I went over to see him and had my picture
                    taken for their Jewish newspaper, on the front page with Rabbi Rosen.</p>
                <p>And he was always worried about - which I couldn't blame the Jews; under
                    Ceausescu, of course, he sent a lot of Jews to Israel, about $20,000 a person or
                    something like that. That's where all the money went. The money went to - a lot
                    of people don't know this, Ceausescu had a brother who lived in Vienna, and
                    apparently the money went through him. These millions and millions of dollars
                    went through the brother. And about two days after Ceausescu and his wife had
                    been eliminated, the brother went down in his basement and hung himself. There
                    wasn't much made of that, but I don't think anybody's ever found out whatever
                    happened to all that money.</p>
                <p>But we had Elie Wiesel visit, and I attended the ceremony at the synagogue. And
                    Wiesel came up to me and thanked me for the support I'd given to the Jewish
                    community. And I said it was my pleasure.</p>
                <pb facs="0244" n="Page0244"/>
                <p>I'd offered sanctuary in the residence to Rabbi Rosen if he felt threatened, and
                    he never had to use it. So I was glad about it, but nevertheless the invitation
                    was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So a real persecution didn't materialize?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No. It didn't materialize. But I can't blame them for beinafraid. I can't
                    blame anybody for being afraid with that background.</p>
                <p>Q: So how was Joanie doing through all of this?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Hell, she was just doing fine. Joanie and I had never gone to church much
                    - she would get flowers from the garden every Saturday, and she'd bring them
                    into the church, the little Anglican Church, and she'd decorate the church. We'd
                    been fortunate in life, we saw that a new heater and a new roof and things had
                    been put on the church that Joanie and I paid for, personally - it was a small
                    building, but it was needed - and that sort of thing, and saw that the - I'm
                    trying to think of the minister's name, but I can't think of his name - that his
                    quarters were made a little nicer. It sounds like we were being terribly
                    generous, but really it didn't cost much more than a few thousand dollars spread
                    over time.</p>
                <p>You know, the ambassador gets paid; you the taxpayer pay an ambassador. At that
                    time you were paying me $125,300 a year, which comes to about, after
                    withholding, about $3300 every two weeks, I think. And I was having it put in my
                    account at the First Interstate Bank that Grant Stebner watched. And we couldn't
                    spend any money over there. So this thing was accumulating, and then other
                    things, of course, that I'd done before were doing very well, too. And so I
                    found myself with a lot of money in my checking account that I never intended to
                    have. So I didn't hesitate to do things like that for the church and for the
                    college - I mean, not college, but American School of Bucharest.</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact, when I went back there I went to the American School of
                    Bucharest, and the principal was a person who was there when I was at post, and
                    he said, “I want you to see a room.” And I went in, and there was a plaque in
                    the room that said “Punch Green Room.” It's for computers; I had given them
                    enough money to get computers.</p>
                <p>And I must say also that Larry Napper, he gave some money, too, and on a relative
                    basis he was more generous than I was, which I thought was a tremendous thing on
                    his part.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the two of you from time to time getting to feel
                        hemmed in,or what we'd call cabin fever?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No. We'd get out. We'd get out.</p>
                <pb facs="0245" n="Page0245"/>
                <p>Really, you didn't get cabin fever. I get cabin fever now because it's cold and I
                    can't do anything. But you never had cabin fever over there because there's no
                    time.</p>
                <p>I remember once I said to Larry, I said, “Larry, I'm going to take Sundays off. I
                    can't do this thing every day.” And you know, I'm the ambassador. He said,
                    “Okay, we'll make that do.”</p>
                <p>I did that once, and I felt so guilty I said, “Forget it. Give it everything
                    you've got as long as you're going to be here and then leave.” So I just stopped
                    that Sunday off stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Taking Sunday off was getting out of town or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, just staying around and reading a book and getting awafrom all of
                    this, but it didn't work. It didn't work for me.</p>
                <p>You know, I've never taken Martin Luther King Day off. I mean,Christmas or
                    something, you know, I take that off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had lots of visitors...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>Q: ...and one of the first ones sounded like an interesting one, a Congressman by
                    the name of - well, tell me about visitors. I mean, there was a great variety of
                    visitors, but some of them may really stand out more than others. What did that
                    mean for the embassy to have visitors arrive? Frank Wolfe was the Congressman's
                    name.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Some of them are quite frankly a pain in the ass. You're so busy, and
                    you've got to spend time with them. And you've got to keep them on your side
                    because you've got to go to them for the budget, and they can just - they can
                    raise hell with you. I don't know whether I'll leave this in my statement or
                    not. Because a lot of them do a lot of good; a lot of them are wonderful. And
                    Frank Wolfe was all right, as a matter of fact.</p>
                <p>I gave him one of the Romanian flags with a hole in it. I've got one down here.
                    I'll show it to you. Right off the streets, and real life television was playing
                    these flags with the hole in it; that's where the Communist symbol was cut out,
                    and that's what they were using for a long time.</p>
                <p>Frank Wolfe he was delighted with it and used it when he got to Washington,
                    showing everybody, including the President. And that's what a lot of these
                    people want, you know.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it's kind of a public relations thing...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes, it's a big public relations thing, and it seems to me they'd
                    always come in when you were right at the height of something and they made
                    demands. And sometimes their wives come with them, and they're - some of them
                    are wonderful, and Joanie was wonderful with them. That's where she was just
                    great. I'd ask occasionally, “How are you getting along with that one?” She'd
                    say, “That's a load.” But you know, you just went along with it.</p>
                <p>One thing you knew, you knew the thing was going to end. This wasn't your life.
                    And I knew when I was leaving was January of 1992 because that's when Romanians
                    went off the Security Council of the United Nations, and that's another story
                    because that deals with the Gulf War.</p>
                <p>And then we'd get away, too. Joanie and I spent 13 heavenly days in Salzburg,
                    just the two of us. We just had a marvelous time. Salzburg was good. I could get
                    back from Salzburg if there was trouble; I could get back within four hours -
                    just go to Vienna and fly out, so it was a good place for me to be. And yet it
                    had - we went and saw a lot of the country that I'd never seen and she'd never
                    seen before. And they treated us just terrific.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Senator Dole came, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. He was wonderful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like you're quite an important [figure]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, it's a terribly important thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the purpose of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, I don't know what the - fact finding. Everything's facfinding.</p>
                <p>They'd all come over to see me, and this isn't just Dole, they'd all come over to
                    see me first, and then they'd go up to see Shirley Temple Black in
                    Czechoslovakia. And I kept saying, “Now, don't forget Romania,” you know. But
                    that was the glamour thing; when they'd get through with seeing Bulgaria or
                    Romania - most of them came to Romania - and then they'd go to see Shirley. That
                    was the glamour end of it. That's what the wives wanted to do, too, you
                    know.</p>
                <p>She got so - Shirley got so that she was giving people - she got so many visitors
                    she gave them 15 minutes apiece. She had to get things done herself, you know.
                    But she was wonderful. She was absolutely terrific. This country owes quite a
                    bit to that lady.</p>
                <pb facs="0247" n="Page0247"/>
                <p>But anyway, Bob Dole came over with four or five other Senators, all Republican
                    Senators. And the Romanians wanted to greet Bob Dole at the airport and take him
                    into the city, and I didn't want that. I wanted him to go in with me in an
                    armored car.</p>
                <p>So his plane landed, and I ran up the stairs before anybody, just when they
                    opened the door, and Dole was just kind of waking up. And I told him, I said,
                    “I'm the Ambassador. When they ask you to come, you come with me. Don't go with
                    them.”</p>
                <p>“Okay. Okay. Okay.”</p>
                <p>And I ran down the stairs. Then I greeted Dole formally when he camdown.</p>
                <p>He's a very funny man. I remember going up to see him - we were going up to the
                    Palace, and he said, “This is where the president lives?” And I said, “Yes.
                    You're going to see him.”</p>
                <p>And he said, “Well, I can't get elected in our country, maybe I coulbe elected
                    president here.” He said, “It looks pretty good...”</p>
                <p>I said, “Yes, they treat him pretty well.”</p>
                <p>But Dole was a very nice man. But he worked very hard. A lot of these people
                    don't. A lot of them pose with the rabbi and go upstairs and go to sleep at the
                    residence. But not Dole. Dole saw everybody. He saw the minority groups -
                    minority parties, I guess you'd call them - is that what we call them?</p>
                <p>Q: Yes.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. And then of course he spent time with Iliescu. And they had good
                    representation there. I can't remember all of the names. Connie Mack was there,
                    Senator from Florida. The guy out of New York just defeated...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: D'Amato.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: D'Amato, yes. We, Nick named him the bomb thrower. I was sitting next to
                    him once at a meeting, and they were having some problems or something like
                    that, and D'Amato said under his breath, he said, “Phone the miners.” I just
                    broke up.</p>
                <pb facs="0248" n="Page0248"/>
                <p>It was a good group of people. We gave them a luncheon, it was kind of
                    interesting, this was Joanie's idea, of hotdogs and American flags, and it was
                    going to be a kind of a picnic. It was near the Fourth of July; but it wasn't
                    the Fourth of July. The Fourth of July, we should talk about that, too, at
                    sometime because the Fourth of July celebration is all over the world. My first
                    Fourth of July was something else.</p>
                <p>But anyway, I sat next to Jake Garn the Senator from Utah. He's noin the Senate
                    now.</p>
                <p>I asked him about the Mormon church. So he spent two hours tellinme about the
                    Mormon church, which I found fascinating.</p>
                <p>But the hotdogs and things, we couldn't find any hotdogs. We had to get them out
                    of Sweden, and they came in tins, and they were little tiny things. But we had
                    them, anyway. Put two hotdogs in between two Romanian Buns. But anyway, we had a
                    lot of fun.</p>
                <p>Joanie's always been able to do that. When things go wrong at a party, she makes
                    a joke out of it and presses on with it, and then everybody else relaxes,
                    too.</p>
                <p>We had an interesting visitor who was, I think she was a Kennedy, but I'm not
                    sure. I know I'm throwing names out, but Joanie, like anybody else she kind of
                    wants to meet these people, too. And this was a visit - she was with a committee
                    or something. But she said to Joan - and I don't know, this may sound awful
                    snobbish; I don't know how to put it, but she said, “You're non-career, aren't
                    you?” And Joanie said, “Yes. How did you know?” And she said, “Well, I just
                    knew.” We were at ease talking with any of these people. Some people have a
                    tougher time; they're not used to it. Joan and I have thankfully gotten over
                    being impressed with this type of person. However, don't misunderstand me, we
                    are respectful. I didn't let it bother me. It could be a problem, but I felt
                    comfortable in my role as Ambassador and everybody knew I was a friend of the
                    President of the United States.</p>
                <p>I think some of the other Ambassadors might have had a tough time. They probably
                    might have had a tough time any place. This is not a quiet post, like Sweden or
                    something like that.</p>
                <p>I want to tell you something; I should bring this up right now. You know, nobody
                    knew me particularly, and this thing happened fast. I mean, I'd been over there
                    a short time and now they were satisfied that they could live with me for the
                    two-year stint, and I was sure of that. We had to make the hard decisions, get
                    Americans out of the country and that sort of thing. And then how did I react
                    when there were about 16 of us left in the chancellery and how did I react on
                    this thing and things like that, and that would spread through the Embassy. And
                    I realized that it would spread through the Embassy, and come back pretty
                    fast.</p>
                <pb facs="0249" n="Page0249"/>
                <p>So we got along very well. I gave them a big New Year's Eve party in 1990, when
                    we finally had moved out of the chancellery - just an all-nighter. As a matter
                    of fact, I knew I was getting along with them pretty well because they
                    short-sheeted my bed.</p>
                <p>I'll tell you another thing I did. I cleaned the toilets. I'll tell you why I
                    cleaned the toilets: Everybody else was very busy doing their professional
                    things, extremely busy. They needed the Ambassador to, they needed the
                    ambassador to handle a lot of things, to make a lot of the decisions and things
                    like that, but I had time. And I was a buck private in the United States Army. I
                    outranked anybody in Bucharest, including any Admiral that visited, but I was a
                    buck private in the United States Army, and I had cleaned a lot of toilets. And
                    we couldn't have any Romanians coming into the chancellory. We couldn't allow
                    anybody but Americans in there. There weren't any visitors during the
                    revolution. And the toilets were getting to be kind of a mess. So I said, “Where
                    is the stuff?”</p>
                <p>They said, “Oh, you can't do that.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Why can't I? You're busy. I'll do it.”</p>
                <p>Well, that was helpful when they came back. That got around that this guy, do you
                    know what he did? You know, that sort of thing. So that was - I could tell, I
                    could tell by the reaction of the people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you hear stories from any of the other non-career
                        ambassadorabout [indiscernible]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, not particularly because I don't think - one I ran into - well, I
                    won't say what country - and I stayed with him, and he was - if I had been like
                    him, they would have hated me. He was insufferable. He was terribly stuck on
                    himself. So was his wife. It was okay in the post he was in, but it wouldn't
                    have been right for Bucharest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [indiscernible]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: [indiscernible] and form their own conclusions, and it's going to take a
                    long time to bring this thing around. People think it's going to happen fast.
                    People over here thought it was going to happen fast. They had free elections,
                    there. What about our first free elections? We still have problems here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was thinking of raising the most favored nation issue,
                        but yoknow, perhaps in the order of events we should go through Iraq
                        first.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0250" n="Page0250"/>
                <p>GREEN: A most favored nation - and I was criticized, I understand, for leaving
                    Romania when I did because they did not have most favored nation, or they
                    thought that I could get it for them. What they didn't know was that we had to
                    get something that nobody knows about first, a Jackson-Vanick amendment, lifted
                    or recognized. Jackson-Vanick meant simply that you could cross borders freely,
                    I think, something like that.</p>
                <p>Ceausescu about one week before the Senate and the House lifted most favored
                    nation for Romania gave most favored nation up - I mean, as far as the United
                    States - he did it first. So I had to start all over again with this thing. Most
                    favored nation is great words, and it sounds good - like excess profits tax
                    does; there isn't such a thing, really, but it sounds good.</p>
                <p>And some of the thieves like Iraq that have most favored nation. But it was
                    essential to get this country M.F.N., the only thing they could sell in the
                    United States competitively was wine, really. Good wine, they tell me, but I
                    don't know that personally. I'm told by my wife it's good wine. I want to make
                    that very plain to you, Jim.</p>
                <p>But anyway, we got Jackson-Vanick, and we got it - as a matter of fact, Marlin
                    Fitzwater helped. It did not require going through the congress, just be done by
                    the administration - and they called me to tell me I had Jackson-Vanick, it was
                    okay, it was lifted, don't worry about it.</p>
                <p>And I said, “I've got to have something in writing.” I said, “can't just do that.
                    You've got to give me something.”</p>
                <p>So Marlin Fitzwater, who was the President's public relations man, a wonderful
                    guy, funny man, he wrote it on the back of an envelope and gave it to this man
                    at State, and so they cabled it to me. So I had something.</p>
                <p>So then with that we could progress and start getting them most favored nation.
                    And I wasn't worried about Romania getting most favored nation when I left. If
                    I'd worried about it, I would have stayed, but I wasn't worried about it because
                    I knew what progress was being made. And actually I could do more for them in
                    Washington than I could in Bucharest. But I was criticized by some newspapers
                    for leaving before that was done, but they got it, so I haven't worried
                    much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find [indiscernible]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. Sure. Well, it is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was [indiscernible]?</hi>

                <pb facs="0251" n="Page0251"/>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I think it was perseverance. Tension. I mean, in order to get things
                    through the Congress of the United States and to the attention of the President
                    of the United States, or the administration, I should say, you've really got to
                    have some people behind it. You've got to have votes behind it. There aren't a
                    lot of Romanian votes. There are more Romanian votes in Oregon than people
                    think, but there's not a big constituency, like the Irish vote and this sort of
                    thing. You've got to really get people when they're feeling like they want to do
                    something good.</p>
                <p>Q: So this was something you would try to sell to visitors...</p>
                <p>GREEN: Sure. Oh, yes. That was one of the things, and that's one reason why you
                    spent so much time with them. I mean, it was always in the back of my mind, but
                    it was most favored nation and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I had good support. When everybody thinks of the State Department,
                    they think of the Secretary of State. Well, there are an awful lot of people in
                    the State Department on the seventh floor. That's where all the power is. I
                    mean, quote, unquote, power.</p>
                <p>But my desk officer is very important to me. There's a fellow there now that I
                    talk to occasionally, the desk officer, and he helps me with certain things. And
                    they change every two years. They change too frequently, because I'd get one
                    friend, and another would go off, but it is great training for them.</p>
                <p>But they would steer you to who we should see and who we should not see and who I
                    should contact and who not contact. Who's mad at us and who isn't, that sort of
                    thing. And it's a good system, I might add.</p>

                <p>GREEN: Not particularly. Yes, there were; there were some people that didn't like
                    Romania. Like the guy that I think lit Jim Baker's fuse. I mean, he didn't like
                    any ex- communist country. I don't know who the guy was. I do know, but I can't
                    think of his name. Matter of fact, I saw him in the hall once when I was back. I
                    knew who he was, and I knew he knew who I was, and I quickened my step. He went
                    in this room, and I was going to follow him in and sit down and have a little
                    friendly discussion, and then the door shut and was locked.</p>

                <p>Q: There were some adverse stories, and this gets into our next subject, but

                <p>The thing is when you're so busy you don't have time to be petty like that. You
                    don't have that time. It comes out later, and look at how it did work out. I

                        thesproblems with Iraq, and Romania's part in that story.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0253" n="Page0253"/>
                <p>GREEN: Well, all right. An interesting thing, with all of this going on, is that
                    - you know how the United Nations Security Council is formed and has what they
                    call a permanent five membership - that's China, the United States, Britain,
                    France and - well, anyway. And then there's about six other - or seven other
                    nations that are selected to go on the Security Council for two years.</p>
                <p>During the Gulf War, the Romanians had just been put on the Security Council. If
                    you check your history, which I'm sure you do, Jim, I think I'm right on this,
                    in August of 1990, Iraq attacked Kuwait. The President of the Security Council
                    for one month, and they attacked it early in the month, early August, was the
                    Romanian representative.</p>
                <p>Iraq did everything they could, offered Romanians free oil, free this, money, and
                    they never wavered. I was constantly - if ever you got your money's worth out of
                    an ambassador, you got it during this time because I was constantly day and
                    night - because ambassadors had to do this if they were in the country -
                    delivering demarches to the president or the foreign minister - a demarche is a
                    demand - well, it was the United Nations, but it was the United States who was
                    the principal player.</p>
                <p>They never turned me down. They didn't say yes right away; I'd have to argue a
                    little bit sometimes, and they'd tell me - as I think was smart of them - what
                    Iraq was offering them occasionally. And I said, “I'll report that back, but you
                    know in the long run who's going to win this war, and you know in the long run
                    who your friend's going to be. And who do you want on your side? Just always
                    think of that.”</p>
                <p>But anyway, every demarche was answered favorably. I'm very proud othat.</p>
                <p>The Gulf War was probably, for me at least, more dangerous than any of the other
                    times, and I was worried about Joan more than I was about anything else because
                    if anything happened to her, I mean, I'd never forgive myself. And she didn't
                    have the protection that I had. We got her out of the country for a little
                    while, and she visited some spots.</p>
                <p>But there was a sanction, I guess you'd call it, out on the British ambassador
                    and the American ambassador. And they got a hold of it, and so I was - I had a
                    person from the State Department traveling with me with a gun, and then I had
                    Romanians, and they'd get me out of the car, and they'd duck my head down, and
                    look up, not down. I found that interesting.</p>
                <p>We were always trying to figure out how to get out of the embassy and that sort
                    of thing, how to leave so that we wouldn't be in a set pattern so somebody could
                    - it was an armored car, but you know, if they wanted to launch a rocket at it
                    or - it's not going to stand up to it.</p>
                <pb facs="0254" n="Page0254"/>
                <p>I'll never forget, the follow car was right like that behind us with about four
                    of these Romanians, fully armed, and then this fellow sitting next to me with a
                    revolver right on his lap, you know. Paneit was marvelous about it.</p>
                <p>Two interesting things with the Iraqis: I went to a New Year's party at the
                    palace, and this is before we had actually attacked. The ground war had not
                    started, but everything else was going on. And we lined up, because Iliescu was
                    there, we lined up as we had given our credentials to the president, and lo and
                    behold, on the left-hand side of me is Michael Atkinson, my very close friend,
                    the British ambassador. On the right-hand side of me is the Iraqi ambassador, a
                    very, very well-dressed, smooth individual.</p>
                <p>Well, they took a picture of it, and it's kind of interesting there was this one
                    spot where there's quite a bit of room between the two, and that's the Iraqi
                    ambassador and myself.</p>
                <p>But I said to him - I think this was New Year's - I said to him, I said, “Mr.
                    Ambassador, I wonder if I could speak just briefly to you right here, sir?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Yes, I'd like that.”</p>
                <p>I said to the Iraqi Ambassador, “I wish you a peaceful New Year,” and he very
                    nicely said to me, “And I wish you a peaceful New Year, Mr. Ambassador.” He went
                    on to say, “According to the television I've been watching, there will not be
                    any fighting.” I said, “Well, I'm not a liberty to talk about it.” I said, “I
                    think our conversation should end now.” (End of tape)</p>
                <p>Did I mention the Iraqis also lived right opposite me? They did. Their residence
                    was - beautiful residence - right opposite me. I never saw them; they were never
                    outside.</p>
                <p>But we had Romanian police very thick around our residence, and then the Iraqi
                    had Romanian police very thick around his residence. And the war was about over
                    - it was obvious that we'd won this thing and that they were going to sign
                    things. At that time we were getting CNN. And so we were trying to figure out
                    how to leave the residence. There were two or three ways you could leave and
                    confuse people if they were going to do something.</p>
                <p>So I said, “Aw, let's go out the front door. What the hell. This thing's over.”
                    So we got in the car, and we went out the front door, turned right, and I
                    happened to look at the Romanians guarding the embassy. Now, mind you, we're in
                    a black Cadillac in Romania, with an American flag on it, going slowly down the
                    street. I look over there, and all of the Romanian guards of the Iraqi embassy
                    had turned and were presenting arms to the American ambassador as he rode
                    by.</p>
                <p>And I said, “Paneit, we've won the war.”</p>
                <p>“How do you know?”</p>
                <pb facs="0255" n="Page0255"/>
                <p>I said, “Take your eyes off the road and look to your left.” And hdid. It was
                    quite a sight. Quite a feeling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did the Romanian government, on the Security Council,
                        why dithey side with the Americans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: It was to their advantage. And they wanted to be - they wanted a free
                    market economy. They didn't want to go back to Communism. They know that this
                    guy's a thug that's governing the Iraqi. It didn't mean anything. It was just -
                    it wasn't to their advantage. That's what most people - whether they like it or
                    not, that really is the way most people are.</p>
                <p>Gregg Peterson, my son-in-law in Minnesota, wanted an explanation of how we got
                    some Romanian twins out for adoption - he said, “There is a story behind this,
                    and the grandmother of these twins wants to know it.” And I said, “Well, okay,
                    I'll do it.” And I sat down and I dictated the enclosed to him and received a
                    very nice letter in return from Gregg.</p>
                <p>Remember, at one time I mentioned in preparation going to school at the foreign
                    service institute across the river in Virginia, and one of the subjects that was
                    brought up - of course this was all of us sitting around going to various
                    countries - was adoptions and things like that. And they gave it a very short
                    shuffle, and they said, “Well, don't you worry about it. That's the Consul
                    General” - that's Ginny Young - “the Consul General's problem, not the
                    ambassador's problem.”</p>
                <p>Well, that wasn't right as far as I was concerned. It became very much of a
                    problem for me because it's a small country and adoptions were huge - became a
                    huge problem. Abortion was illegal in Romania, so therefore you'd see a lot of
                    abortions that were done very poorly, and then the injured human beings. And
                    also these people would have babies but would abandon these babies. And they put
                    them in these orphanages, and when Ceausescu was overthrown, it was a terrible
                    mess.</p>
                <p>And the British came in with their nurses, some male, and I was terribly
                    impressed by them. And the Americans were wonderful, too. And we adopted, I
                    think, probably more than others, and Ginny Young set up as best she could a
                    list of people who were legitimate for the Americans to see to find a child for
                    them type of thing.</p>
                <p>But it just soon ran amok, and people weren't getting quite what they needed, and
                    the conditions in the orphanages were deteriorating. The only conditions that
                    were worse were under the Ceausescu regime, and later on, because they can't fix
                    everything overnight, the conditions for people like you and myself, the older
                    people, the ones that didn't have much tread left on them. I mean, the old
                    people's homes in Romania weren't anything. They were terrible.</p>
                <pb facs="0256" n="Page0256"/>
                <p>But anyway you had to put your priority on the youth. And so I would get these
                    calls from Congressmen and Senators that had been over to visit. They'd call the
                    ambassador, and I'd, you know, do the best I could and look into it.</p>
                <p>And then Sixty Minutes came over with Leslie Stahl, and I was spending way too
                    much time on this matter. And she put a black wig on, and she literally bought a
                    child for adoption on the most watched television program in America. That's
                    illegal. You can't do that.</p>
                <p>So I got these phone calls from the Congress. It just lit up the switchboard. And
                    this one fellow I was talking to, it was a Senator, and I said, “Senator, let me
                    tell you something. I'm not a career; I'm a non-career. But these are career
                    people working with it. I am not going to ask my career people to break a law
                    that you people write. I'm not going to ask them to break a law of the United
                    States and end up going to jail or being fined or something like that. I'm going
                    to bend them. Don't worry, I'll bend it as much as I can. But I'm not going to
                    ask anybody to break the law. I'm thinking of their lives, not only the
                    children's lives, but I'm thinking of their careers.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't understand. The law that they wanted...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, they've got laws in this country about adoptions and all of this
                    sort of thing that are specific. If you bring them in from a foreign land and
                    all that sort of stuff, and people were just desperate. I will tell you
                    something about an adoption before we get through with this, - and this one
                    Senator. He said, “Mr. Ambassador, you've got to save us from ourselves.” I
                    said, “Senator, it's too late.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did he mean by that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, the laws are there. I can't get them fixed. Just do it, you know.
                    We've done it; now you fix it. I mean that's what he wanted done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in other words expedite, get the adoption through?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Sure. Do what you can, but - get us out of it. He's hearing from his
                    constituents, you see.So anyway, the Romanians became quite alarmed by this. And
                    so they put a very - the word isn't “tough,” a very fair, tough woman in charge
                    of the Romanian adoption program and passed laws themselves limiting or stopping
                    any further adoptions because they were losing the flower of their youth, and
                    they worried about it. The smart people there - and there were plenty of smart
                    people there - were worrying about, “Who are we going to have to carry on after
                    we're gone?”</p>
                <pb facs="0257" n="Page0257"/>
                <p>And that letter that I gave you is an example because we had everything cleared
                    up but three, and it's self-explanatory that we got it done.</p>
                <p>I don't think now there's too much adoption going on, and I think the conditions
                    also were so appalling that not only this country but other countries have
                    stepped in, and the orphanages are in much better shape.</p>
                <p>I remember the first Christmas the orphans came to sing us Christmas carols, the
                    revolution was still going on. It was going on outside. December 23rd or
                    something, 1989. And you know, we felt awfully sorry for them.</p>
                <p>The next year, and I asked that that same orphanage send children the next year -
                    they were going to send children to sing songs sent from that orphanage, and it
                    was like night and day.</p>
                <p>I remember another thing, too - this is a CIA story. I got along with the CIA
                    pretty well. I was telling them this story as we rode in the car, you see, and I
                    said, “Do you see that school?” I said, “You hear the laughter and all of that,
                    kids at play?” I said, “Last year at this time if we'd gone by there would have
                    been dead silence.”</p>
                <p>The CIA fellow turned to me - he was a visiting one - and he said, “Why didn't
                    you tell us that?”I said, “Well, I never thought of it.” But it's true. It would
                    have been of interest.</p>
                <p>I had a CIA station chief from Portland, Oregon who went south, but he did it all
                    after he'd left us, so I didn't want to include it in this, but I want to
                    acknowledge the fact that he apparently went and sold things to the Russians
                    when he [was] stationed elsewhere. I've got his whole file down there. It didn't
                    happen while we were there. Matter of fact, one of the tapes has got it.</p>
                <p>Are you going to look at some of those tapes?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. There was one adoption case you mentioned a moment
                        ago thawas really a dramatic one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: The Minnesota twins. And one in Washington, DC.</p>
                <p>I want to tell you something, we were fortunate to have our owchildren.</p>
                <p>But never have I seen anything like the fight that mothers would go through to
                    get their babies out of that country. It was a - the fathers usually were in the
                    U.S. working - they'd come over, then they'd leave, go back to the United States
                    because they had to make enough money to keep the mothers over there. But it was
                    amazing. The power of a mother is something to see.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How far would they go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I think they'd go any distance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they pretty difficult for you to handle at
                        times?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Some of them were very difficult. This Minnesota twins mother was very
                    nice. I never saw her much because I didn't want to because I had a daughter
                    living there, and she just found out about my connection after I came back.</p>
                <p>But there was one very difficult woman from Washington, DC who was just
                    impossible. Oh, she threatened me and called me every name in the book and that
                    I wasn't doing anything, I was placating her and all that. We got her child out,
                    too. That was the other child, incidentally.</p>
                <p>Her brother wrote me a letter apologizing. He said, “My sister'very
                    difficult.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you essentially, would you say, got that situation
                        pretty muccleared up for your successor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. We - yes because then they had their own law, which wa- you know, now
                    I notice some people are adopting Chinese children.</p>
                <p>I know one thing. I've often thought about it. If I had to adopt, and I was over
                    there, I think I would have adopted about a five- or six-year-old child. You
                    could see how they were coming along, and they were old enough to be grateful.
                    And I saw - a couple of the military over there adopted five- or six-year-olds.
                    One adopted twins. Boy, they were cute. Two girls. And of course they were going
                    into the military life, I guess, but they loved their dad, and they loved their
                    mom. And they were over there; they had the mother and father over there because
                    they were in the military. But I've often thought, boy, that's the way I'd do
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you have adopted a boy or a girl?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Girl. Q: You like girls?</p>
                <p>GREEN: I love daughters.</p>

                <p>Q: You know a real interesting phenomenon which is a later thing, I think, is the
                    Romanians who have ended up over here and getting into elder care. Do you have
                    any insight into how that happened?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, you're right. There is quite a bit of that. I've talked to people
                    who said that their parents are being cared for very well by Romanians in this
                    elder care program. You're right. I don't know why. It might have started with
                    “The Miserables”, and they found a niche that they were good at, and “Here, this
                    works pretty well,” and they brought in some other Romanians that they knew and
                    trusted, and it could have spread from there. I don't know. It never occurred to
                    me till your question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to pick up a number of points that will probably
                        lead tother things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>You mentioned your first Fourth of July, and that's in '90, probably?</p>
                <p>GREEN: July 4th, 1990, and they'd had the election, and I'd come back and I
                    hadn't gone to the inauguration of the president. He did not attend our July 4th
                    celebration - but they did send a military band, and a few ministers did show.
                    But everybody in Bucharest tried to go to the Fourth of July party. The Fourth
                    of July the world over is - every American embassy is open for a party. And
                    that's where a lotof your money goes that you're allotted is the Fourth of July
                    party, and that's when you start doling out your own dough to take care of a few
                    of these things.</p>
                <p>But anyway, it was more successful than I thought it was going to be in spite of
                    the absence of President Iliescu, and I understood why he wouldn't be there. I
                    called personally, and they said, “Well, what do you think, Mr. Ambassador?” And
                    I said, “No. I understand, but I want you to know that he would be welcome.” But
                    anyway, he didn't show, and I don't think I would have in his case, either.</p>
                <p>But anyway, so it was a lot of fun. It was a hot day, and there was the Romanian
                    military band playing in these - of course they didn't have summer uniforms;
                    they just had uniforms, and they were hot uniforms. So I said to the band
                    instructor, I said, “How much beer do you think they'll drink?”</p>
                <p>He says, “How much you got?”</p>
                <p>I said, “I understand.”</p>
                <p>So I went over, and I talked to Eugene, my cook - or the butler, I guess I talked
                    to him. I said, “Get these guys as much beer - that's all they want; they won't
                    let me pay them anything - get them as much beer as they want.”</p>
                <pb facs="0260" n="Page0260"/>
                <p>And it was a marvelous party. Everybody had a good time including the band, of
                    course. But it was also the first time for many Romanians that they'd been
                    inside the American residence.</p>
                <p>I think it was the next year was the - the next year was the - we had the Fourth
                    of July party, and that was when the Gulf was going pretty strong. And I had
                    standing right behind me this fellow that became a pretty good friend of mine
                    who came out from Washington, the guy with the gun who was with me all the time.
                    I asked him once, I said - anybody coming up, you know, I was shaking hands with
                    everybody who came up - I said, “What would you do if you saw something? Would
                    you shoot them or what?”</p>
                <p>He said, “No, I'd just throw you to the ground and throw myself on top of you.”Q:
                    You identified something called “Green's law.”</p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. Green's law. [laughs] That's Alan Docal was thone to put that in
                    the award write up.</p>
                <p>It's always irritated me that things from countries - I'm not talking about
                    individuals; a gift from an individual, that's up to them to see that it gets to
                    the right place. But it seems to me that to get goods - from the taxpayers of
                    one country as a taxpayer to the people of the other country, what's the purpose
                    of that gift? Where should it go?</p>
                <p>And what alerted me to it, I was in the - I guess in the airport, the airport or
                    the railroad station, but I was waiting for something, and so I wandered around,
                    and I wandered into this room. And there was all this stuff piled high from
                    other countries. I said, “How long has this been here?”</p>
                <p>“Oh, I don't know.”</p>
                <p>“Where's it going to go?”</p>
                <p>“We don't know where it's going.”</p>
                <p>I said, “That's not going to happen to United States stuff.” I said, “You're
                    going have Green's law involved in this thing.” I said, “If a given item is for
                    example due to be given to a library in [a particular city], those books are
                    going to that library, and we're going to have somebody ride herd on it and
                    actually see that they get there.”</p>
                <p>And that's what we did; we established Green's law. And I don'think anything went
                    astray. I really don't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So somebody from the embassy actually checking...</hi>

                <pb facs="0261" n="Page0261"/>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. See that it didn't get taken off the docks and go othe black
                    market.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I don't know. I didn't worry about that. I think if you get worried about
                    that sort of thing, you're starting to be God. I mean, I've got my problems,
                    you've got yours. You solve your problems, I'll solve mine.</p>
                <p>But Green's law was - and it was kind of a gag, too. I said, “Comon; it's Green's
                    law. Work it.”</p>
                <p>That was Alan Docal picked that up. He was a wonderful guy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The American ambassador, you in particular, assumed a

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I think so. It was a while before I did because being a non-career and
                    these people being career. But the United States ambassador naturally assumes a
                    leadership role. They have to listen to you. You listen to the German
                    ambassador, you listen to the French, you listen to the British, the
                    Canadian.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: That's right. “What are you going to do?” You know, you have to be very
                    careful. And sometimes you don't know what you're going to do. And tell them, I
                    think that's the smartest thing to do is say, “I don't know what I'm going to do
                    yet. If you really want to know, I'll tell you later on what I'm going to do,
                    what I have done. I'm not trying to keep a secret; I just don't know. There are
                    a lot of things to think about here.” But I'd always get back to them.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, in sort of that role you took the lead in
                        resistinharassment by the government; what was that about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, yes. The government was harassing us on a lot of small things. One
                    was the Diplomatic Club that they had there. I never went to the darn thing.
                    Under Ceausescu it was just turned into nothing. There used to be a golf course
                    there, and Elena Ceausescu thought it was too bourgeoisie, so she had it torn up
                    and it was farm land, which it was never farm land, it was just overgrown swamp,
                    really, when they got through with it.</p>
                <p>So we tried to get the Diplomatic Club as being a nice place for people to go. I
                    mean, they were entitled to that. And they'd harassed us on that and things like
                    that.</p>
                <p>And then they'd harass us on rents for our residence, for my residence. It was a
                    funny thing; I mentioned what you paid me, $125,500 I think I said. Five percent
                    of that would go to the rental of the residence, so that was also taken out from
                    my check along with Social Security and withholding, etc. I didn't care. You
                    don't go into those things for money, I'll tell you that.So yes, they'd get
                    petty. You've got to realize that when you have a new government, you don't get
                    rid of a lot of the petty ones that were there before. They had their jobs - a
                    lot of it's not very popular with a lot of those people because they had
                    something going. The population was miserable, but the bureaucracy kind of liked
                    it the way it was. They had all the little privileges and perks, and things like
                    that, and you had to break that down, and when that fell, I mean their old
                    habits would surface pretty easily. And you knock them down. And we had the
                    power to do it. We'd go to people in the government and tell them, and they'd
                    see to it was all right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The harassment sounds kind of without serious
                        purpose?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I think so. Just to show, “I've got a little power left”type of thing. You
                    know, power's - well, you said it.</p>

                <p>GREEN: Yes. She was very much involved in that, in organizing the NATO wives and
                    other wives. Joanie loves bridge, so we'd have bridge parties. And we'd have
                    some people coming to the American residence of countries - to play bridge, of
                    countries we didn't recognize. And I said, “Joan, we've got to do something
                    about this. They can't come in here.”</p>
                <p>Well, we just let it happen and then nobody said anything, and they kind of went
                    away. They realized it afterwards, so we didn't make anything of it. But it was
                    really funny.</p>
                <p>I remember once, the first Christmas - no, second Christmas, 1990, said to Joan,
                    “Joan, let's get out of here. Let's just take a walk.”</p>
                <p>And I didn't say anything to anybody. We just dressed in normal kind of clothing
                    - looked like a couple of casual people, and walked out the gate. The guard kind
                    of looked at me with a question - and we just walked out.</p>
                <p>And it was an interesting walk. We walked around this lake, and then walking back
                    to the house I looked up and there was this cart, with a horse, and the thinnest
                    Santa Claus I've ever seen. I said, “Joan, look at that. Don't tell me we're not
                    making progress. What we've got to do is get a fat Santa Claus one of these
                    days.”</p>
                <p>I've never forgotten that. That was symbolic, I thought. That was 1990. That's
                    the sort of thing I hope you get into this thing because I think it's
                    interesting. I should have told the C.I.A.</p>
                <p>Q: In addition to representing the U.S. and handling the problems that are before
                    you, you are also being a kind of an advocate for the country of Romania?</p>
                <p>GREEN: You become that. That's covered in your instructions. It'not uncommon.</p>
                <p>It's an interesting point that you bring up. When I think about it, maybe the
                    fellow that I - this mystery man, people back in Washington, DC, maybe they
                    thought I was representing Romania more than I was the United States. It wasn't
                    true, I don't think. I just thought these people needed help and that we could
                    help them. But I always put U.S. interests first.</p>
                <p>But you do, you want to help them. But you want them to help themselves. You
                    don't want to go out and give them a thousand dollars and say, “Here.” You want
                    them to earn a thousand dollars, and then they know what it's all about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that's understood to be part of your work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0264" n="Page0264"/>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. I mean - at least I made it part of my work. A lot of things come
                    naturally. I've always prided myself on people; I mean, I say I'm a lousy
                    fisherman and golfer, but I do pride myself on people. I just can get along with
                    them. I like people - most people; some I dislike, as I hope I've shown in this
                    thing, too.</p>
                <p>But I think that - I want to see Romania progress, but I want to seit progress
                    the right way, so it becomes an ally of the United States.</p>
                <p>I'll give you an example. Boeing would come out. People would come to me. The
                    ministers would come to me occasionally on foreign trade and things like that,
                    and I'd go over and I'd talk to them.</p>
                <p>“Well, how was this done? How did you do this?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Listen, I can give you all the advice you want.” Because they knew I was
                    an entrepreneur. That's basically what it amounts to, I suppose. And I said,
                    “But I represent American interests. I don't represent Air Bus or any of that
                    stuff. I represent American interests. I can sell a Westinghouse product or a
                    John Deere product over here, I'd love to do it. I help those people. But don't
                    ask me how that's done and then go buy something from Sweden. Get the Swedish to
                    give you the advice.”</p>
                <p>And I remember Boeing coming in. They were hot after a couple of planes for the
                    local - Tarom, that was the name of the airline, T-a-r-o-m. And they had a
                    couple of openings in their schedule. So I went with them to sell two airplanes,
                    and that was a fascinating thing to do. I don't know whether Boeing ever got the
                    order, but it was fascinating to listen to them sell an airplane because it was
                    kind of back selling, and that's [what] I do best.</p>
                <p>But yes, you can get too much in love with your country; there's no question
                    about it. You don't help them too much. You don't get in love with a country,
                    you just want to help them. And then you get a little frustrated because they
                    don't - they're not doing things in what seems so obvious to you the right way
                    to do it.</p>
                <p>Q: In your prepping, in your briefing and that sort of thing on this matter, how
                    was it expressed? In other words, how did they tell you you should act in the
                    best interest of your country?</p>
                <pb facs="0265" n="Page0265"/>
                <p>GREEN: They just put it in the book. It was right there. That's the main purpose
                    of the ambassador. It's true. They didn't write the book for a revolution, a guy
                    going into a revolution going from a communist country to a free market economy.
                    That book hasn't been written yet. That book was written for going from
                    Washington to Stockholm or something. I mean, you know, it wasn't Washington to
                    Bucharest. You can't write a book on that sort of thing. You've got to just go
                    by the seat of your pants, and you've got to have a feel for these things. And
                    because I'd faced turn-around business situations in the past. I really didn't
                    see much difference. And I add I just had the right people that I trusted for
                    their advice - including, I might add, including the people in Washington,
                    DC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was very interested in seeing how you were helping to
                        prepar[indiscernible] for his trip to Washington, DC.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Adrian Nastasi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Adrian Nastasi, right. I wonder if you could recount
                        thaexperience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I don't remember it particularly. I mean, you know, he spoke beautiful
                    English. I remember when Joanie first met him. He was the foreign minister at
                    that time. Joanie's about five feet, and he's about six feet three, and he's a
                    good looking guy. Joanie said, “God, you're handsome!” But that was what he
                    wanted to hear. It's what any man wants to hear. He had a beautiful wife. They
                    made a fine hit in Washington, DC. They were just exactly the type of people
                    that Romania should send-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was there from fairly early on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes.</p>
                <p>Q: In one of your letters home you noted they were setting up a number of new
                    people [indiscernible] and younger and so forth. Were they doing this
                    purposely...</p>
                <p>GREEN: Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...to improve relations with the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0266" n="Page0266"/>
                <p>GREEN: With the West. With the West. Not just the United States, the West. But
                    Serge Celac, C-e-l-a-c. Nice guy. Tough guy. First foreign minister - still
                    their Ambassador to London. I think he's still over there. I should have seen
                    him when I was over there, but I didn't have a chance. But he was tough. He got
                    a little insulted because he hadn't had an important visitor over there, like
                    Jim Baker. “You get me Baker, and I'll know you're doing something.” Baker did
                    come, finally, and that satisfied him.</p>
                <p>They have a lot of pride, these people. A great deal of pride. But Adrian was
                    much easier to deal with. He was far more worldly and things like that. I liked
                    him a lot better.</p>
                <p>Q: And then there was the moment when you were helping to prep the - a trade
                    mission from Romania in Vienna.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, boy. Yes. The American ambassador to Austria - a very wealthy Texan;
                    I'm trying to think of his name. And I got to be a little - he looked like John
                    Wayne. Roy Huffington, that's it.</p>
                <p>But I called him up because they invited all these people - all these nations,
                    but Romania wasn't there, on the Danube - it was the Danube, as I recall, a
                    Danube conference. And I said to Roy, “The mouth of the Danube is in Romania;
                    it's at Constanta.”</p>
                <p>He said, “You're right. I'm sorry.”</p>
                <p>So anyway, they invited us, but there wasn't - then there wasn't room on the main
                    floor - so we were put in a sub level. So I had these two ministers, one the
                    banker, and one I think a foreign official - anyway, they both spoke good
                    English, and they had a pretty good feel for a free market economy and how to
                    talk. So I just - yes, I went over to their offices and prepped them a little
                    bit in what Americans would want to hear and that sort of thing. You know, “Sell
                    them on their country. Be proud of their country and sell them on it.” You've
                    got agriculture, you've got all these things, you've gone through tough times,
                    and you've got beautiful places to ski and all these things you love.</p>
                <p>But I remember in particular going to Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacker in
                    Vienna. Anyway, they found a spot for us at the conference, and so I introduced
                    them and they got up, but I'll never forget the U.S. ambassador to Austria, Roy
                    Huffington, came down to listen to us, which I felt was a terrifically nice
                    thing for him to do - because it's all face. These people are proud, you
                    know.</p>
                <pb facs="0267" n="Page0267"/>
                <p>And then I said to Bob Mosbacker, who I'd known in the Bush campaign pretty well,
                    I said, “Bob, can you spend ten minutes with my two people from Romania after
                    the program tonight?” I said, “You've got no idea what it would mean to them to
                    be able to talk to the Commerce Secretary of the United States.”He said, “Okay.”
                    And he did. And they went back to Bucharest walking on air. It was just what I
                    wanted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So telling these people that, “When you get there you need
                        to -don't stay in the back...”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, don't stay in the back. Get out and shake hands. That's another thing
                    we were doing. I said, “Work the room. Do you know what 'work the room' means?”
                    No, they didn't know what work the room - I said, “This is what I learned when I
                    sold insurance when I was 16 years old, you work the room. Go on, shake hands,
                    'My name is such-and-such,' look them in the eye, give them a firm handshake.”
                    Like I'm talking to kids, you know. And say who you are, where you're from, what
                    you do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They needed that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And did they do that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, they were a little reluctant to start, and I'd push them. “Come on.”
                    “Hey, Joe, come here. I want you to meet...” You know, you have to be that way.
                    It was fun. It was fun. They were shy, you know. That's why I became fond of
                    them, and I think they became fond of me because they knew I was trying to help
                    them.</p>
                <p>Q: So a lot of these things came out - I thought that the report at the awards
                    ceremony was very encompassing. And you say that this is put together, what, in
                    the last month or two while you were over there or...</p>
                <p>GREEN: No, it was put together before the Gulf started. Well, I guess - I don't
                    know when. What's the date on it? I remember Eagleburger - it was June of '91,
                    and he gave it to me in January of '92, so it had all of that in it.</p>
                <pb facs="0268" n="Page0268"/>
                <p>All of these guys, Alan Docal, Larry Napper, Brian Flora, Anita and Don Booth -
                    but you know, they were all apparently meeting on this award justification. And
                    Larry was the one that was doing it - because I was working on Larry's, and I
                    was working on all the others to see that they got something. And one of them
                    said, “What about you,” and I said, “Oh, forget about me. Being ambassador's
                    good enough for me. Don't worry about it. Let's get you; this is good for your
                    career” type of thing.</p>
                <p>And then, I'll never forget, the last ceremony I presented it to them over there,
                    and a voice from the back of the room said, “You're next, Mr. Ambassador,” and I
                    knew something was up, but I didn't react. I was thrilled, but I didn't want to
                    say it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: In Romania. After I had presented - and I said, “I think I've got
                    everybody covered. Have I got everybody covered?” And that's when the voice came
                    up. “Just you, Mr. Ambassador. We've got to get you.”</p>
                <p>And I remember the award I got, this Distinguished Honor award, Larry Napper was
                    - he got one, too, and he should have. And it was kind of an in-State Department
                    award, I think. That's the reason no non-career had ever received it. And he was
                    disappointed I got this award. He wanted me to get one a little higher, which is
                    - I don't know what it is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A different title?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, yes. You know, I imagine the recent Ambassador in China might have
                    gotten it or something. I mean, you know, I don't know what it is. If you look
                    at the thing, when they write it up you'll see there is one more that's higher,
                    and they're not about ready to give that to me, but I was thrilled with this,
                    anyway. Larry was disappointed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the award was first given over there...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Not to me. The award was given to me in Washington, DC by Deputy Secretary
                    of State Larry Eagleburger in the Treaty Room on the seventh floor of the State
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what was the event back in Romania?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I was giving awards, other awards, we had a lot of other awards, to my
                    people - to the staff. I had a series of little ceremonies.</p>
                <pb facs="0269" n="Page0269"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then someone in the back of the room...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, when I was all through, and I thought I had gotten everybody, and I
                    said, “Well, I think I've got everybody - is there anybody I've missed?” You
                    know, kind of a joke. And “Just you, Mr. Ambassador. You're next.” And then I
                    knew that something was going on. Larry was about ready to kill the person
                    because he wanted it to be a total surprise. I'd see these people disappear into
                    the bubble - the quiet room or whatever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they let you knew that something was coming?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, that voice did. But they never - because, and Larry explained it
                    later, he said because it was - he wasn't sure I was going to get it because I
                    was non-career.</p>
                <p>I think Bob Strauss of Russia got one, and I think a fellow that went to Italy,
                    Peter Seccia got one, but I think it was after mine. It was after I was given
                    it. And I'm not sure I'm correct when I say that I am the only non-career. That
                    is what Larry Eagleburger said to me. He said, “I think you're the only
                    non-career that I'm aware of that's ever received this award.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the great lines in the award was there isn't
                        anybody othe staff here who wouldn't walk through a brick wall for you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, that was wonderful. I remember that. Well, we did gea closeness.</p>
                <p>I had an advantage, Jim; I had an advantage in the fact that the revolution
                    happened, and everybody got to know me under the most raw of circumstances. It
                    wasn't a gradual getting to know a person. You were thrown together. Cleaning
                    the toilets as ambassador of the United States, no ambassador from the United
                    States cleaned a toilet. I did. Not that I'm any different. I'm sure the other
                    ambassadors would have - Shirley Temple Black would have done the same thing
                    under the circumstances - but there are also people that don't deign to do that.
                    I can think of this one guy, he wouldn't ever think of doing something like
                    that. He'd get a Marine to do it, off-duty Marine to do it.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a continuation of the oral history with Punch
                        Green, anthis is the 21st of July, 1999.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>So we were talking about the flag with a hole in it.</p>
                <pb facs="0270" n="Page0270"/>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. On July 11th of this year, 1999 - which if we can believe it is
                    about ten years since the revolution in Romania, and I got over there on
                    December 1st, 1989 - but I gave a speech to the National Association of Romanian
                    children at the Doubletree Inn in Portland, people from all over the country
                    with a lot of children there. And ABC was covering it on 20/20, and they will
                    send me a tape.</p>
                <p>I don't know, but what I highlighted, it seems to me, was that I presented them
                    with the flag - I had two flags, one clean, and one was given me by a freedom
                    fighter right off the street, with all the dirt of Romania of the revolution on
                    it, and I'm keeping that one. But I gave them the one that the government of
                    Romania, gave me for the children, and things like that; I thought it was an
                    appropriate place for it to be. So we'll see it maybe on ABC, 20/20 around
                    December of 1999. I don't know. But it was a very moving time, and people were
                    crying and things. I didn't particularly intend that; that's not my style. But
                    it was emotional.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: People knew you at this event?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, but they knew of the conditions, they knew of the things - yes, there
                    were a few people that did know me, and there were a few people that I'd helped.
                    I mean, that's nice, but -.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It would be good to put into words your connection with
                        thcountry of Romania.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, it will always be a big part of my life. I believe in going forward;
                    I don't believe in going backwards, Jim. We can kind of do a little wrap-up on
                    this thing today. I've made some notes.</p>
                <p>But it had a tremendous effect on me, the job and the conditions and my respect
                    for the Romanian people. I would suppose if I'd been to Bulgaria or
                    Czechoslovakia or Poland, it would have been similar. But this one is the one
                    that had the real revolution, had a bloody - it was a bloody time, and I - you
                    know, I would like to talk to Ambassador Sasser sometime, what he recently went
                    through in Beijing. I mean, they didn't attack our building, but he (Sasser) -
                    you know, he has to have similar feelings.</p>
                <p>And it does change your life. It changes the way you think about a lot of things
                    because it makes you really realize how wonderful it is to be an American. I
                    will never forget - and I think I've said this; if I haven't, I want to make it
                    an emphasis - that in Bucharest there were probably more embassies in Bucharest
                    than there were in any city in the world because they've got China, and you've
                    got two of them, Red China and Taiwan. You had Albania. We weren't speaking to
                    Albania at that time. And all of these - Cuba, they were all there because - you
                    know, and they were all represented, I mean, people that we did recognize plus
                    all the others.</p>
                <pb facs="0271" n="Page0271"/>
                <p>But there's only one embassy, where there's a constant line-up outside our
                    consul's office to get to be citizens of this country. Nobody else. Germany for
                    a while because they were taking all the Germans they could back, but that was
                    just Germans. This was everybody. And I think I've gone through “The Miserables”
                    story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: We did that one. And that's the thing I think I'm most proud of, and
                    that's one I want my - particularly my eldest grandchild, Laddie Peterson, who's
                    about 20 years old - to read about, to know about - and that should be included
                    in this tape. That is a purposeful comment. The others I want to know, but
                    Laddie's seemed more interested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you developed a concern for the whole country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, I've got a concern for the whole country, the area and everything,
                    yes. But it's - you know, for a lot of time I was trying to educate the
                    government, people in the government, they became friends of mine, what America,
                    what the free market economy, what a democracy and everything, and all of a
                    sudden we're getting CNN finally in the country, and I'm getting it in the
                    embassy, and I - that was my present to the embassy and to the residence.
                    There's a funny story involved there, but - well, we've got time.</p>
                <p>I spent a lot of money on a German thing that didn't work, and this guy for 500
                    bucks said, Romanian said, “I'll put it up.” And they put a rickety thing up,
                    and he said, “Don't pay me if it doesn't work.” And I said, “Okay, try it first
                    at the chancellor,” the little cafeteria at the chancellor, and it worked fine.
                    I went out and gave him $500 bucks. And the next ambassador, it's something I'm
                    very embarrassed about, sent me - got the money back and sent me - and I've
                    never thanked him - sent me the check for quite a bit of money for what I had
                    spent and it didn't work. I should have thanked him; I just got busy. Anyway,
                    I'm thanking him now. Maybe he'll read this some day.</p>
                <p>But anyway, the Clarence Thomas - and what was her name, the girl'name?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hill, Anita Hill.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0272" n="Page0272"/>
                <p>GREEN: Anita Hill. And that was on television. When I'd come home from these
                    various functions I had to go to at night, about 10:00 or 11:00, because it's
                    about a 10-hour difference between Washington and Bucharest - we're ahead of
                    them. And I'd sit there in the den just to relax and watch CNN, but I'd watch
                    this thing, and they were covering this thing. And I couldn't believe it. I
                    said, “This trash is going all over the world.”</p>
                <p>So after about three days of this stuff, I went in to see the foreign minister,
                    Adrian Nastasi. And I said, “Mr. Minister” - I'd got an appointment with him,
                    and I want to come over and see him, and he's always was kind to make time for
                    me - he's a young guy, much younger than I am. And I said, “You know, I'm
                    watching CNN, and I'm sure you are, and I'm in here talking to you people about
                    my country and how great my country is and everything else, and I know what
                    you're watching on CNN. Don't get the wrong idea. We're not like that. I've
                    never seen anything like that myself on television.”</p>
                <p>I don't know who's right between the two. I'm not going to make a judgment there
                    because I can't, and I'll never know. But I think Clarence Thomas has gone on to
                    be a pretty good judge, from what I hear, but I'm not going to make a case -
                    that's not my field.</p>
                <p>But anyway, I'll never forget, he looked at me, and he said, “Mr. Ambassador, we
                    know that.” And I was relieved because I was embarrassed.</p>
                <p>Q: Can you tell me your thoughts about the idea that your personal connection
                    with this country was part of your success? Can you imagine another person,
                    another ambassador not playing it that way and as a result not having the same
                    success?</p>
                <p>GREEN: That's a tough question, Jim. I mean, I'm myself. You'd have to ask - I
                    tell you what you'd have to do, you'd have to ask Jonathan Rickert or Larry
                    Napper or Dot Evans that question. You can't ask me that question. They're all
                    pros, they're professionals.</p>
                <p>I've got a personal opinion, yes. I think it was the right time for me. I think I
                    was - I think all my experience in making sick businesses well and things like
                    that - one reason I'm a little late in seeing you is that I was - went over
                    about this hat, and I saw some glaziers outside, one of them had a Benson hat
                    on, and that's the company, one of the companies in which I was involved. And I
                    talked to the glaziers, and they were kind of excited to talk to Punch Green.
                    They remembered me.</p>
                <p>Yes. I felt very comfortable at all times, let's put it that way. I did not feel
                    uncomfortable. And I felt that I'd gone through it before and I'd been trained
                    for this particular time. Somebody up there was just trying to say, “Punch,
                    you're going to be tested one more time” type of thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0273" n="Page0273"/>
                <p>But I had wonderful people. You're only as good as your people. That's why if you
                    want an opinion, I think you should talk to Dot Evans - I mean, I really do.
                    Particularly of all of them. Do you have her phone number?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I've given it to you, I think. I'll give it to you. Or Larry Napper or
                    Jonathan Rickert. She's got the numbers of all of those people.</p>
                <p>But obviously they're on my side - and obviously I probably know what their
                    answer's going to be, but for me to say anything, it sounds awfully
                    braggadocious. I mean, they wrote the thing for the Distinguished Honor Award.
                    They're the ones that wrote it. I didn't write it. I mean, I didn't even know it
                    was going on. And so I know pretty much what they're going to say to you. I
                    mean, that's the reason it means so much to me because the professional staff at
                    the Embassy wrote it.</p>
                <p>Q: I'm kind of imagining counsel from somebody, maybe stern counsel, “You're
                    getting too close to these people. You have to stay removed from them...”</p>
                <p>GREEN: That's a good question. Jim Baker chewed me out once - it was right after
                    the revolution, and Iliescu was President, and the miners had come to town, and
                    the State Department recalled me, and I was mad about Iliescu going down and
                    thanking the miners for coming to town. I think we covered this an a previous
                    interview.</p>
                <p>This was right after the first election, and I think they had one of the first
                    free elections, and I think it was free. And I went in - Jim Baker asked me to
                    go into his private office. And Ray Sykes, who was a career guy, a wonderful
                    man, was in there; he was kind of a witness to it. And he subsequently became
                    ambassador to Great Britain. You don't see many career people do that, make that
                    to that post there because it's an expensive thing to do.</p>
                <p>But anyway, Jim kind of chewed me out - didn't kind of really did. And I think he
                    was saying that to me, I think it was going around State Department, “He's a
                    nice guy, he's doing his best, but he's not tough enough.” I think that was kind
                    of an attitude of some career people. The thing is, I've always thought I was
                    tough, but I'm tough when I have to be. I don't think you gain much by being
                    tough. I've never felt that. And it could be a weakness, I don't know, but I can
                    tell you one thing, it sure has worked well for me.</p>
                <p>The idea is to increase the - to have better relations between the two countries,
                    and our relations were zero when we went in there. And we could have lorded it
                    over them, we're the United States. I mean, it's the biggest, but I mean my
                    feeling was if we help them, look what we'll do for the world, for these people,
                    if we can help them to help themselves.</p>
                <pb facs="0274" n="Page0274"/>
                <p>That's what I kept telling them; I said, “We can't do it anymore. It's not the
                    Marshall Plan anymore. We can't afford it. But you can - if you do something,
                    we'll try to do something in return.” That's how the free market economy works,
                    and I wouldn't want it any other way. It's worked in business, and it worked at
                    the Federal Maritime Commission, it worked at the Port of Portland, and my
                    attitude worked over there. So I can tell you, I'm not about ready to change my
                    personality. I'll be tough. I fire people, and I've done a lot of that stuff.
                    And I hate it, but I'll do it, and I'll be very tough.</p>
                <p>But you know, I think you can catch a lot more with honey than yocan with
                    anything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So afterward you also serve on the Board of the Council
                        oAmerican Ambassadors.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. We can go into my life after. Let me see if I've goanything
                    particular that - because this we can wrap up pretty fast.</p>
                <p>There are one of two things. Did we talk about the Peace Corps aall?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Okay. The T-shirts and all that? I got them some T-shirts because they
                    were doing things and nobody knew they were from America, and I got sick of
                    this, and so I bought them myself personally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We didn't talk about the T-shirts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I bought them some good thick T-shirts and paid for it myself. That
                    T-shirt had a Romanian and American flag - you know. So they gave me a T-shirt.
                    I have it down at the beach; I wear it occasionally. The name of the Romanian
                    currency is Leu; L-e-u [singular], or L-e-i [plural]. So they put on the back of
                    the T-shirt, “Another day, another Leu,” [pronounced Lay] which I thought was
                    kind of cute. The Peace Corps did a very good job.</p>
                <p>And you know, I ought to bring this up because the tension never ceased. When I
                    left Bucharest, I let it be known that I was leaving. This may sound a little
                    dramatic, but it's true. And my security officer came to see me - I think I was
                    scheduled to leave about January the 11th, we'll say, of 1992. And he said,
                    “We've had a threat which I consider - serious - against you.”</p>
                <pb facs="0275" n="Page0275"/>
                <p>I said, “Well, we've had those before,” and I didn't think too much of it. But he
                    would come out with Paneit, my driver, and pick me up every morning and things
                    like that. So finally I got thinking about it, and I said - and this was after -
                    of course long after the Lockerbie incident in Scotland involving that awful
                    bomb, and I got thinking, other people are going back with me, too, including my
                    wife.</p>
                <p>So I called him up and asked him to come to my office. I said, “Whdid this
                    particular thing bother you? Others you don't tell me about.”</p>
                <p>And he says, “Because this voice was a well-educated voice.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was actually a telephone threat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. It was a telephone threat. But he'd gotten those on me, but he
                    said -. And yet on the Gulf War, there was the - you know, the British
                    ambassador and I were under threat we had some stuff and the India Ambassador
                    had been shot over there.</p>
                <p>So I said, “Well, I think you should let” - at that time it was Delta had come -
                    “the airlines know that I'm going home and warn Delta- about these threats.”</p>
                <p>And it was incredible. Joanie and I, I was very complimented, we left very early
                    in the morning, seven o'clock, - a lot of the embassy people and all of the
                    ambassadors from NATO were out there to see Joanie and me off. We were the last
                    to board.</p>
                <p>We flew to Vienna, and we parked the plane between two tanks, if you can believe
                    it. Then we flew to Frankfurt, and they hustled us off the plane, right into a
                    secure room where they obviously put heads of state; you don't go through
                    anything. You just sit in that nice plush room until the plane's ready to leave,
                    and then you board the plane and you know there are people on the plane that are
                    ready to protect you.</p>
                <p>And then we flew to Dulles Airport, and they said, “I think, Mr. Ambassador,
                    you're safe now,” this guy who I hadn't known was on the plane came up to
                    me.</p>
                <p>And I said, “Yes. We're safe here. Thank you very much.”</p>
                <p>And that was the end of it, but that was - it was the last of it, buit was part
                    of it.</p>
                <p>Since I retired - is that about what we want to - we've covered thlife pretty
                    well, haven't we, up to retirement?</p>
                <pb facs="0276" n="Page0276"/>
                <p>Q: That's essentially the point that we've gotten to. Right. Before we get into
                    that, there are some other points that I want to clarify about Romania.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved with helping Nadia Comaneci, the

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No. I never met her. I know one thing, she escaped from Ceausescu, and the
                    revolution happened a short time later or something, after she went over.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: We were always doing things like that. That was Alan Docal's job in the
                    library and that sort of thing because we were trying to get as much information
                    to the populace as we could about America and about companies and things like
                    that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the video there is a sign, a “Green machine” sign. What

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, what it was was I was at the airport or railroad station, and we had
                    to wait for something, and I went into one of these rooms, and I saw the stuff
                    with dust gathered on it the population needed badly. It was from another
                    country, and it was just sitting there.So I said the Green - Green's law, that
                    was it, that anything that this embassy knows about that comes from the
                    taxpayers of the United States or privately gifted, but we know about it coming
                    in - I can't do anything about someone just doing something, and there's a lot
                    of that done. But I said, “I want to see that we see that it gets to where it's
                    supposed to go and doesn't get to the black market.” And we followed that stuff
                    up very closely, and most of it did get through to where it was supposed to
                    go.</p>
                <p>There was a lot of stuff stolen and got on the black market. Ididn't happen too
                    much to us. I suppose some.</p>
                <p>Q: That's right. I remember your talking about that. There was a relief effort, a
                    check for $33,000 came in from the Chapel family. Does that ring a bell?</p>
                <p>GREEN: No.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The IMF stepping in and setting up conditions in a

                <pb facs="0277" n="Page0277"/>
                <p>GREEN: That was after me. All of that stuff was. They were starting that sort of
                    thing, but it was - you know, the revolution was in December of '89, and I left
                    January of '92. There's two years in there where you're just getting things
                    going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before that, in April of '91, the government doubled food
                        prices.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, they probably did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been a hardship.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Terrible. But what are you going to do, that's their government. You can
                    tell them it's too much but you see, we had a great advantage in the foreign
                    service nationals that worked for the embassy. Every embassy all over the world
                    has got them. They're the bureaucracy. No matter who the ambassador is, they're
                    staying. Most of us come in for two or three years, the career people come in
                    for two or three years, and they go on to other posts. But the foreign service
                    nationals stay. It's like that in Washington or anything else.</p>
                <p>And we made this - it wasn't my idea, but I think I mentioned this, Anita Booth,
                    she was working, and she said, “Why don't we pay our foreign service nationals
                    in American dollars?” And we did that. We changed. And they would take it,
                    instead of the official rate. They would take it out to the airport and get
                    unofficial exchange. But they made out very well, and that's what was important
                    and I got the best people. That was very important to me.</p>
                <p>But people, you know, they say - there's a lot of bartering and trading and
                    things where money isn't involved. It can't be. It doesn't mean anything. It's
                    paper that isn't worth anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very fluctuating market, I would imagine.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, terrible. Terrible. Very, yes.</p>
                <p>Q: So when you went into retirement now, I wonder if you could describe how
                    consciously or deliberately you did it, what your thoughts were.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, yes. I'll tell you one experience I had. I came back here. We had
                    the award ceremony, then Joanie and I gave a party for the people that were in
                    Washington, ambassadors and friends and people from Portland.</p>
                <pb facs="0278" n="Page0278"/>
                <p>I asked one of my guests if he ever used the term Ambassador in his retired life
                    - he looked at me and said, “Well, Punch, occasionally it comes in very handy -
                    especially if a room in a crowded hotel is needed, or to get a seat at a packed
                    restaurant, or tickets for a sold out play, etc.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Okay. I'll bear that in mind.”</p>
                <p>So I've used it that way several times and I have two cards, one business card
                    straight and one “Ambassador of the United States, Retired.” And it's kind of -
                    you know, it's an interesting title. Americans don't like titles. We fought a
                    revolutionary war to get rid of titles. But if you've got one, it's kind of an
                    interesting thing to have, and one goes through quite a bit to get it.</p>
                <p>I will tell you one quick story that I use, an experience that happened to me. My
                    daughter Kelsey, the one who lives here in Portland, gives me as a Christmas
                    present every year four lunches, every quarter she and I walk down to - it used
                    to be Trader Vic's and now it's called Piatti.</p>
                <p>But it's my job to make the reservation. So what I did was I heard Kelsey walking
                    down the hall, and I hadn't made a reservation, and it was the Christmas season.
                    So I called Trader Vic's, and I said, “This is Ambassador Green, and I'm going
                    to be in say about half an hour, and I want the corner table in the Mai Tai
                    Room.”</p>
                <p>And the voice said, “We've got plenty of room, but how do you spelyour first
                    name?”</p>
                <p>I use that story all the time. I think it's a great line. It getpeople kind of on
                    your side.</p>
                <p>That's one of the experiences. That story kind of enhances basically why I came
                    back to Portland and didn't stay East where I could have - I had some feelers if
                    I wanted to pursue them to be a talking head on television from one of the think
                    tanks and that sort of thing, and I didn't want to do it. I wanted to come back
                    where my roots are.</p>
                <p>But then also I was diagnosed in 1993 with prostate cancer. I had had a lot of
                    physical examinations in Europe but no PSA test. And it was about a 21+ reading,
                    which is very high. And I just got lucky it didn't spread, but if I'd stayed in
                    Romania, I think, six months, it would have spread. It's not Romania's fault;
                    it's the United States' fault. They don't give a PSA test when they do a
                    physical. I took a complete physical every six months. They examine for
                    prostate, but they do it the old fashioned way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go into treatment then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, no, I had an operation here and had it successfullremoved.</p>
                <pb facs="0279" n="Page0279"/>
                <p>Dr. Grout held my hand. There was a period when I got back where I wasn't sure. I
                    remember once when I first got back and before - I was in this office but it
                    wasn't furnished yet, and it was kind of dreary. And I drove down and I just
                    walked outside and walked around Portland, and I felt a little dizzy. And I went
                    over to Lloyd Center to see a movie. It was Father of the Bride. It was inside
                    the mall, and I walked by and I saw this pizza place and everything and all this
                    food that was uneaten, people had left. You know, it wouldn't have made any
                    difference to me three or four years before. I would have said, “What a waste,”
                    and all that. But it struck me. I mean, I just remembered some people that were
                    hungry in Romania.</p>
                <p>Seeing this very funny comedy really was great for me. After all I've been Father
                    of the Bride three times - I sat in the back row and laughed uproariously, and
                    in certain scenes, cried uncontrollably - I felt much better when I left the
                    movie. I assume there is a medical term but the pressure for me was off. (End of
                    tape)</p>
                <p>I will tell you, this is an emotional experience, what you and I are doing, Jim.
                    A lot of this stuff about my father and my mother and my sister and all this,
                    about my youth, that I was having - not nightmares, but I'd go home and I
                    couldn't sleep. I'd think, I'd say, “Gee, I'd forgotten” - I mean, the plates in
                    my head. All of this stuff, because this is about me.</p>
                <p>Usually I don't talk about myself. I usually just let it happen, let others -.
                    This is all stuff that's there for family history, and my daughters know it very
                    well.</p>
                <p>But since what I've been doing since retirement is I've got this office downtown,
                    and it's kind of a small, a nice office, to save my marriage. Really, Joanie and
                    I, if I stayed home I'd be in my jammies all day. You know, I wouldn't shave,
                    I'm sure. It would be awful. But I like to come down here. I'm not an
                    outdoorsman. I play some golf, but I'm terrible. Had 112 the other day. I just
                    can't play the game.</p>
                <p>But I've become involved - I was very much involved in Senator Gordon Smith's
                    campaign, both campaigns. And Norma Paulus was mad at me for not supporting her,
                    and she's still mad, I think. But I thought it was that generation's time to
                    come. And I've never regretted supporting Gordon Smith.</p>
                <p>I've worked helping my daughter, Kelsey, on the Oregon Humane Society, and it's
                    about made its goal for the new building - they're building a new shelter for
                    the dogs and cats and all that - I don't like cats, but they do - and all the
                    other animals.</p>
                <pb facs="0280" n="Page0280"/>
                <p>I've been involved in some things like the Good Samaritan Hospital Foundation,
                    and the Columbia River Maritime Commission. But I find that I'm not very good at
                    meetings anymore. I think I'm kind of burned out on meetings. The Council of
                    American Ambassadors, yes, that's interesting because it's - you know, we all
                    have the same past, and I meet a lot of people I know and things like that.</p>

                <p>GREEN: Oh, you just lose your interest. You hear it, and they're saying the same
                    thing, they talk in a monotone - it's not anything, it's just I think it's an
                    age thing, I think you've paid your dues, you feel you've paid your dues, “What
                    am I doing listening to this?”</p>
                <p>And also, let's face it, if you're poor they don't want you on those things. They
                    want you to give some money, and you can see right through that. I mean, I don't
                    blame them. They're right. So I've gotten away from doing that. Now I'm
                    involved, interestingly, in Governor George W. Bush's campaign in Oregon. I'm an
                    Honorary Chairman, along with Mark Hatfield and some others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're not burned out on that kind of stuff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No. Not burned out there at all. No, not at all. That's different. That's
                    my hobby. I've decided that is my hobby. Politics and current events and things
                    like that is my hobby. I'm interested in speakers that do that. I mean, I'm not
                    very interested in some of the other things.</p>
                <p>I find that I've got to admire the person that's talking before I find much
                    interest. If the person hasn't done much in life and is getting up there giving
                    me advice or the audience advice, I find myself rather bored listening to it.
                    And that happens all the time.</p>
                <p>I sometimes think that what I'm doing is working for Kelsey Green Grout more than
                    I am for anybody else and that my pay is a lunch every quarter because I help
                    her out with her tasks; Lincoln High School, you know, they're having troubles
                    raising money, so I'm helping with that.</p>
                <p>So I manage to keep busy, and my spirits are up, and I thank a Dr. Tom Miller for
                    that a lot because he's my doctor, and he's doing an awfully good job keeping me
                    afloat.</p>
                <p>Q: Can we spend a little more time on the fundraising? It has really public
                    value. The Bush campaign of '92, after the ambassadorship, were you involved in
                    that?</p>
                <pb facs="0281" n="Page0281"/>
                <p>GREEN: '92, I wasn't, no. I didn't get too much involved in that. Yes, I gave
                    them some money and when I came home, he was 80 percent ahead of Clinton. I
                    mean, it was incredible. I did call Washington. Matter of fact, I talked to Mary
                    Matlin. I said, “Do you realize what's happening?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who do you share this role with? Say, working for Bush,
                        you arthe principal person in Oregon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: For George W.? Oh, no. I'll tell you who I share it with. I share it with
                    “Butch” Swindells, Bill McCormick, Craig Barkman, and Lori Hardwick. And here's
                    an invitation that just went out; it was a very successful fundraiser. The
                    Oregon Chairman is United States Senator Gordon Smith. You've got the Honorary
                    Chairmen, Commissioner Jack Roberts, United States Senator Mark Hatfield,
                    Governor Victor Atiyeh, Congressman Greg Walden, Congressman Bob Smith, and me.
                    And there's the others. And I got most of them, at the start of the campaign in
                    January 1999.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you teach any of these people anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No. You don't have to teach anybody here. These are the best. That's why I
                    got them. I got them in January. I did it fast. At the Bush Library opening in
                    Texas, I'm on that board, which doesn't meet much, but it looks good on your
                    r�sum� - and I saw the governor there. And I went up to him, and we talked a
                    little bit, and I slipped him my card. And I said, “You know, I would like to
                    help you - I think you're going to run - for your dad's sake and your mother's
                    sake.” I mean, I love them both.So he slipped my card in his pocket. He couldn't
                    say much. It's a little difficult to say too much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he know who you were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, he kind of visually knew who I was. And he since has learned a lot
                    more because he said, “Hello, Ambassador,” at this fundraiser. I mean, I got one
                    early letter that said, “Dear Alan,” and now it's a little note saying, “Dear
                    Punch,” so you know, sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering if he had an idea of what you could do for
                        him.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0282" n="Page0282"/>
                <p>GREEN: I don't think so. I mean, he's young; why should he? His dad did. But I
                    started off before anybody asked me. I did it down in Palm Springs, and I didn't
                    tell anybody I was calling long distance. But I made twenty phone calls for
                    Governor Bush, twenty of the best I could find in Oregon that I knew about,
                    women and men. I got twenty yeses. I mean, this is Mark Hatfield I'm asking. You
                    know, he didn't hesitate. It's incredible.</p>
                <p>And Butch Swindells, Bill McCormick, and Craig Berkman are the best, and there is
                    nobody better than Lori Hardwick, nobody in this state. The only one I'd compare
                    is Kelsey Green Grout. She's as good as Lori Hardwick.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kelsey learned that from you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I think she did it naturally. She's seen me in action though.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, there's also another group of fundraisers led by
                        Hemstreet,and I think Bob Smith is on that group. Are you involved in
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, no. I'm not involved in that. I'll tell you one of the difficulties in
                    that group is they want so much money - which is all right, I can afford to do
                    it, but the people if you want to really note these people that are in the
                    Hemstreet and other PACs are very few individuals. It's usually corporations of
                    PACs or something that give to that, five, ten thousand dollar figure. I mean,
                    that's what they're into - I very seldom go that strong on a personal level. I'd
                    very occasionally call the bank up and tell them to send a check over, but it
                    comes out of my funds, personal funds. And I do that occasionally if I really
                    feel strongly on something. But I mean that's where these people raise most of
                    their money is from PACs. Democrats, Republicans, it doesn't make any
                    difference. Labor is the same thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really a different approach.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, it's - you know, soft money they call it. One thing I do know, if I
                    was going to give money like that, I would give it to something like IMPACT,
                    another PAC, but I would be sure who it goes to in the Republican Party, because
                    I have a big disagreement with the far right of the Republican Party, and I just
                    won't support them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Hemstreet is more conservative.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: If it's got Gordon Smith involved and those people, I'll gfor it. It's the
                    people involved.</p>
                <pb facs="0283" n="Page0283"/>
                <p>I don't know. I haven't given anything to them, I know that. But I mean I'm just
                    not going to - I mean, it all depends who - I have to know the person. I know
                    some special funds occasionally have been put together, and they've asked me to
                    participate, and I've said, “Well, who gets the check? Who do I give the check
                    to?” And it's a name like - well, not Gordon particularly because he's elected,
                    but somebody I trust. You know, it's trusting judgment, that's all. I'm not
                    after anything. I don't want a bridge built or a highway improved or anything,
                    or a contract. I just want good government, or my kind of government, which I
                    think is good government. That's the thing I want.</p>
                <p>But it hasn't happened much. Usually they are from left field - I'll tell you one
                    little story, it's a Romanian thing, and it's a little note I made, but it deals
                    with Oregon, too, and good government I would go and have dinner occasionally,
                    particularly with Joanie, out of town, I'd go to the Marines and have dinner,
                    and that was a big thing for them, that the Ambassador - you know, never done it
                    before. They had what they called the Marine Hut, and I used to love to go eat
                    with those kids. You know, it made me feel young again.</p>
                <p>But I noticed, I had looked around and there were state flags, but I didn't see
                    the Oregon flag anywhere. So I wrote the Secretary of State of Oregon, Phil
                    Keisling, enclosing my check for $75 - Anyway, he sent me back an Oregon flag
                    and my $75 and a nice little note. Phil is a Democrat so I'm bipartisan in my
                    praise.</p>
                <p>So I gave it to the Top, the top sergeant, you call him the Top. I gave it to the
                    Top, and then I waited a couple of weeks, and then they asked me to come over -
                    Joanie and I both, to come over to the Hut for dinner, and we did, and right as
                    I walk in the door, there's the Oregon flag. Made me feel pretty good. That's
                    the last little homey story.</p>
                <p>You do those things when you're away. It's the way I feel about this area. When
                    you leave a post such as Romania you are just nervous, I guess. I mean, the
                    contrast - I wasn't afraid of the future, I was financially independent and I
                    love my wife, and my daughters were fantastic - everything was fine. There
                    wasn't anything that wasn't working right for me. That probably was the problem.
                    I needed a problem. I needed something to worry about. My wife's always has
                    thought that I'm happiest when I've got something that concerns me - because I'm
                    used to it. And all of a sudden here I've got retirement - I can do anything I
                    want in the world, and it kind of bugged me. You know? There was a terrific
                    contrast. I think this reporter at KATU, she asked me what I was going to do,
                    and I said, “Well, nothing particularly. I don't know.” And she said, “That's
                    going to be tough on you.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She said that in the interview?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I don't think she said it in the interview, but she said ioff camera.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0284" n="Page0284"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was thoughtful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. And I said, well, I'd thought it out.</p>
                <p>One thing I do want to do is I want to straighten out that - at the start of this
                    oral history - it seems years ago, my youth, my mother, my relations with my dad
                    and mom. I said I think in there somewhere that - you asked me, “Did you love
                    your dad more than your mom or your mom more,” and I think I said I loved my dad
                    more. That's not right. I mean, I adored my mother. There were times, I think,
                    when you like your dad more than your mother or your mother more than your dad.
                    I thought they both had lots of problems, and now I know it. At my 74 years of
                    age, looking back I think they were two very remarkable people, but I adored
                    them both.</p>
                <p>Q: You come to understand them better, and maybe you can describe this process of
                    coming to understand your parents, your father and your mother.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, you know, I think we all go through it. We've all got parents, and
                    sometimes there are problems. Somebody once said to me you either live your
                    father up or you live him down, one of the two. There's no in between. And I've
                    thought about that a little bit.</p>
                <p>Q: What does that mean?</p>
                <p>GREEN: It means the guy's either a good parent or isn't. I mean, women seem to -
                    mothers seem to - it seems to be the other way around, they don't seem to have
                    the same criteria. Maybe that's my generation with this new thing that's coming
                    along now with people - you know, with the CEO of Hewlett Packard a very
                    talented lady, maybe all that's going to change. But that's the way it was when
                    I was growing up.</p>
                <p>And I think it is awful tough - I think we went through this, but the trip from
                    rich to poor is awful. It's not an easy trip going from poor to rich, it's a
                    tougher trip than people think if you're going to handle it right, but I tell
                    you, my son-in-law, John Mengel in Chicago, was sending our two grandsons to a
                    private school in Chicago, eight and six years old. He says, “I've got to get
                    them out of there.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Why?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Do you know the parents have the kids chauffeured in, thkids have got
                    cellular phones, they've got all of this.”</p>
                <p>I said, “At that age? It's not realistic.” I said, “You get my grandchildren out
                    of that environment fast.” And he did. They moved to Winnetka.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0285" n="Page0285"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had that idea, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: He's the one that brought it up. I didn't know about it. But it's that
                    sort of thing that people don't understand. I've had wealth in the past in my
                    family and we've bounced back, and I've been around people who have wealth - now
                    and I'm not intimidated by anybody, frankly, and that would include Bill Gates.
                    I mean, I'm not intimidated; they can do it or not. And that includes the
                    President. I mean, I've gotten that confidence, but it's taken a long time to
                    get it.</p>
                <p>But by having that, you can look at people pretty objectively. I mean, I think a
                    person that's a good teacher is as valuable as anyone - I mentioned my doctor,
                    you know, literally saved my life. As I say, I think the thing I'm most proud of
                    is “The Miserables” experience in Romania. That couldn't have happened if George
                    Bush and I hadn't had that relationship at that time. That could not have
                    happened.</p>
                <p>You say do you make a difference, that is one I can point to and sayes, I made a
                    difference there.</p>
                <p>Q: Tell me more about doing it right in going from poor to rich. What do you mean
                    when you say it needs to be done right? What are the hazards?</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, like I explained, the parents of the children in Chicago, the
                    private school. In Minneapolis, they've lived in Wayzata, and they've gone to
                    public schools and they're wonderful. My grandchildren here go to Lincoln High
                    School. They're wonderful. In Minneapolis, in Wayzata, the public schools are
                    great.</p>
                <p>But in Chicago they're tough public schools, and so they have these private
                    schools for the rich kids, is what it amounts to, or people that can afford it,
                    and they're pretty expensive schools. And these kids come in, and that's not
                    doing it right. These kids should be scruffy, they should be - you know, they're
                    missing a lot of fun. Some of the parents probably don't pay much attention to
                    them at all. They think you pay $5,000 a quarter or whatever it costs them, and
                    “I've done my share.” I mean, that's what I mean by buying trouble- I think
                    there's an obligation from generation to generation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you've seen the results of playing it wrong?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0286" n="Page0286"/>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I've read of them committing suicide and drug abuse, etc., I've seen
                    them just become obnoxious people, not nice people. I mean, all sorts of things
                    can happen. I think it's bad things. And it's so easy to do it right. I mean,
                    it's so much more fun to do it right.</p>
                <p>You can be nice to people. I gave you the example. I mean, I don't walk on water,
                    but stopping and talking to my glaziers, I mean, they knew me. That gives me a
                    thrill. They had a thrill, they were talking to the ambassador, I know all that.
                    But I mean it was a big thrill for me. They said, “Hey, you remember Abe? I'm
                    going to see Abe. I live two doors from Abe.” Abe means a lot to me in my life.
                    Big guy, tall guy. He was my foreman at Benson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do other people because of their money lose the ability to
                        dthat, do you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I don't think other people do it. I don't think they do it as much. I'm
                    more a people person. But yes, I think - some of them are just great. You call
                    Bill Swindells up, Willamette Industries, he'll answer the phone. It's all how
                    you play it. You know, it's that sort of thing. Some guys make you go through
                    all sorts of things.</p>
                <p>For a while, they were asking here, “Who's calling, please?” Well, I did it on
                    purpose because you'll note in the phone book I don't have an address. I've got
                    my name, but - in the yellow pages, same thing, no address. I did it because I
                    was getting some funny calls when I got back to Portland from people that
                    expected things, you know. It just happened because I had a lot of publicity at
                    that time.</p>
                <p>So finally my friends were getting sick and tired of “Who's calling, please?” and
                    they'd say “Mickey Mouse” or something like that. And so I knocked it off here,
                    and I haven't had any trouble. They just say, “You have a call.” So I just take
                    the call now, no matter who it is.</p>
                <p>Q: Your grandchildren are growing up. I wonder if you could describe what their -
                    well, your children and their families. I wonder if we could have a look at
                    them.</p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, the oldest one is Carter Ladd Peterson. I gave you what my oldest
                    grandchild Laddie had written, Laddie Peterson, going to Williams College, “The
                    Most Unforgettable Character.” And she's doing very well. She's working in a
                    pizza parlor this summer in Minneapolis, and I think that's just great.</p>
                <p>Carter's husband had a tough time getting going, he really has, but I think now
                    he's got a hold of something, and he's got some financing behind it, which I
                    hope the company progresses well. He's an awfully good guy and a marvelous
                    husband.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of a company is it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0287" n="Page0287"/>
                <p>GREEN: New Bio is what it's called. It takes some waste disposal for breweries
                    and bakeries and things like that, people that have a very tough time getting
                    rid of certain disposal things to meet the standards. They have to spend a lot
                    to get rid of this very tough waste, and they have developed this thing - or
                    these people in Idaho, actually, developed it and Gregg and some others have
                    joined them, and they've developed a product that will rid the plant of tough
                    waste. It's kind of an interesting concept. And as a matter of fact they've
                    installed a vat in Bend, Oregon in a distillery that's using New Bio.</p>
                <p>So he got some financing. He called me not long ago. And he's done that himself,
                    he and his people, and I'm very proud of him for stepping up there and doing
                    it.</p>
                <p>And then Kelsey Peterson, well, she's figure skating and things. She's still
                    young enough not to have a regular job, I guess she has a job teaching figure
                    skating and she's done a lot of babysitting. She's a beautiful girl. Both of
                    them are beautiful.</p>
                <p>And then Clark Peterson is a young guy. I gave him a driver for a present, so
                    he's a golfer. You know, in Minnesota they're into ice skating and hockey and
                    things like that that we're not into.</p>
                <p>And then here in Portland is John Grout, my second son-in-law who I've known all
                    his life and is the son of one of my very closest childhood friends, Gordon
                    Grout, Dr. Grout. And John and his brother, Randy, have the Grout Company. He's
                    gotten involved in other types of businesses, and I've gone into a few of them
                    with him, I mean just as an investor, nothing major. And one of them, matter of
                    fact, is working out pretty well.</p>
                <p>And then there's Wesley Grout, who is my oldest granddaughter in Portland. She's
                    just wonderful. I'm going to have dinner with them tonight. Joanie's gone to the
                    beach.</p>
                <p>She and my grandson, Gordon Green Grout, just got back from Europe. Can you
                    imagine? That's her second trip over there. She was babysitting Gordon, her
                    brother, and Gordon went over to see a cousin, Edge Trullinger - well, anyway,
                    Susan Hoffman's youngest son. Gordon's eight, I think, around in there. When I
                    was that age, I was homesick when I went to Taft Beach in Oregon for a week with
                    the Grahams.</p>
                <p>And then in between there's Eloise Grout, and she's a horse lover, and she wants
                    her parents to buy her a horse, and horses are pretty expensive. So she's
                    working at babysitting and everything else saving all she can to get a horse.
                    She's diabetic, and we're watching that closely. It's funny, on the Grout side
                    or the Green side there's no diabetes that we know of, but anyway, she's
                    handling it very well, and that's tough at any age.</p>
                <pb facs="0288" n="Page0288"/>
                <p>As far as the Chicago (now Winnetka) contingent is concerned, John and Ladd
                    Mengel, they have two great sons, Jack who is 11 and Charlie Alan who is 9. They
                    are both going to public schools and seem to be getting along very well. I once
                    asked his dad, when I was playing golf with him, I said, “John M., how is
                    Charlie Alan getting along,” and he turned to me and said, “Charlie has never
                    had a bad day.” I just hope he's one of those fortunate individuals that goes
                    through life with the right attitude and continues to never have a bad day.</p>
                <p>John M. sold his business and has now become involved in one of thes.com
                    businesses and it seems to be going along very well.</p>
                <p>They live in Winnetka.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a very nice community.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. And they're going to public schools there, and they just walk
                    down a couple of streets so that potentially bad situation cleared.</p>
                <p>John is quite a guy. I love them all. I'm a very lucky man.</p>
                <p>I don't know whether I told this story or not, but I remember - and if I did I'm
                    going to let you edit the thing, but it's not bad. A man said to me in Romania,
                    one of the first parties we had at my residence after the revolution, this man
                    came up to me, a minister or something, and he spoke English very well, and he
                    said, “Do you have any family?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, there's my wife Joan,” and then I said, “Three daughters and three
                    sons-in-law and eight grandchildren. And they're all doing very well.”</p>
                <p>And his reply to me was what was so interesting. He said, “You're a very rich
                    man.” And I said, “You're right.” And - he was right!!That's not a bad place to
                    end it, Jim.</p>
