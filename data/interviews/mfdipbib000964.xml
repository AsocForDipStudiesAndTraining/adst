<p>DR. WILLIAM E. REED</p>
<p>Interviewed by:  Henry E. Mattox </p>
<p>Initial interview date:  July 3, 1992</p>
<p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  This is an interview with Dr. William E. Reed, at Greensboro, North Carolina.  Dr. Reed, I usually start these things out by asking you to state for us, for the record, something about your background, where you came from and what your education was, what your professional interests were and that sort of thing, before the Foreign Service.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  Well, I was born in Columbia, Louisiana, in 1914.  My elementary education began in 1920, in a two-room, two-teacher Rosenwald school.  It was the first Rosenwald school.  I went there the first year that was...</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Rosenwald?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  Yes, it was Julius Rosenwald.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I'm not familiar with that.  What was that?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  Oh, that was a program funded by a philanthropist who was interested in providing education in the southern states in areas that education was deficient.  He not only provided money to build schools, but he provided supervised, trained teachers in those early days.  It began in the early part of the twentieth century.  The founder was the one connected with the founder of the Sears, Roebuck and Company and that group.  He was one of the early manufacturing and sales persons, who made a lot of money, and he set up this foundation to help needy areas of the country.</p>
<p>Well, anyway, I went to that school for two years.  It burned down after two years, and I went to school for two years in a church.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did it burn down accidentally?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
<p>REED:  You see, schools closed and were protected, and perhaps someone went in and camped in it or something like that, and it burned.</p>
<p>Anyway, for two years I went to a church, then a school was built.  Actually my father was a building and construction man.  He was from Missouri, but he had come to Louisiana to built the Louisiana Central Lumber Company.  He took a great interest in the schools, and he literally built this school.  It was a brick school.  My father was particularly proficient in building construction for commercial buildings, dwellings, homes, and that type of work, all the way from Monroe to Alexandria.  But he settled in Columbia, and that's where I was born.  He had five children.  I had four brothers that followed my Daddy in the building construction work.</p>
<p>But I was the first of the children to go to college and finish college.  I attended college at Southern University in Baton Rouge.  I finished in agriculture and science, and I was a county agent for three years.  Then I went to graduate school at Iowa State University and earned a Masters' Degree in 1940.  I started teaching at Southern University and taught there from 1941 through '46.  In 1944, I received a General Education Board fellowship and went to Cornell University, and I earned my Ph.D.  I actually completed it in 1945; it was conferred in either January or February of '46.  But I started teaching in January, back at Southern University.</p>
<p>In October of '46, I was contacted by the State Department, which invited me to join an economic mission to Liberia.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  They wrote you?  They telephoned you?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  I was contacted by the State Department.  Actually, it was the National Academy of Sciences that had listed my name as a suitable person to contact.  And I believe it was my major professor, who was a member of the National Academy of Sciences.  He was the head of the department of soil science and agronomy at Cornell.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What was your Pd.D. area?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  My Ph.D. was in soil science, soil chemistry.  I was in school at Cornell from 1944 to '45.  I had the Ph.D., and I was invited to join this team.</p>
<pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
<p>The money funding this economic mission to Liberia was through the State Department.  The reason for establishing this mission was that before President Roosevelt died, he had made a loan for twenty million dollars to build a port in Liberia.  After President Roosevelt passed, the State Department was concerned about whether Liberia would ever be able to repay that loan.  Before that, small amounts of money had been loaned to Liberia, but I think Liberia had defaulted on most of those payments.  So there was a concern about whether Liberia would ever be able to repay that loan.  Unlike today, the loan was made without any feasibility study or anything, and there was very little information in Liberia itself, what missionaries and all, and it was scattered.  Actually, there was very little factual economic information on the economic potential of Liberia.  So a small team of about 15 officers was sent to Liberia to make an economic survey, and I was a member of that team.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Do you remember who the team leader was?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  Oscar W. Meier was the chief of the mission, you could call it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was he an economist?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  I don't think he was really a trained economist, as such.  He was supposed to have had some experience in administration of a..., but I don't think he was really a trained economist.  He was more or less a person who had worked in the government and had moved up more or less in administration.  Perhaps he might have had some experience in managing finance, but I don't think he was an economist.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So all 15 of you got together and flew out to Monrovia.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  We didn't go out at one time, no.  The recruitment was scattered.  When I arrived, Meier was there, and there must have been four or five other officers.  There was one person who had been there before, and he was held on.  His name was Frank Fender.  And Frank Fender had carried on a type of agricultural extension work, but he really wasn't trained in research and that type of thing.  He had been there during the war period, when our government sent people out to promote the extraction availability of agricultural products that would be useful for the war effort.  He had been there earlier, and so he was held on.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was the mission based in the embassy?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
<p>REED:  No, our headquarters was in the old German legation building, which I imagine had been almost vacant since World War I.  During World War II, there had been a public health program there, and there was already in operation a team, I think detailed from the military, to supervise the building of the port.  So that was another unit there.  Our program was directly under the control of the State Department, whereas the public health mission was under the Department of Health...not Human Services then.  It was another unit of government, but not under the Department of State.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How did the team conduct its activities?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  Well, my responsibility was to travel into the field and to collect information on the different soils.</p>
<p>In fact, I could give you a publication that was done of my work, a report of the mission.  There were two reports that were published by the State Department and the U.S. Department of Agriculture: my report; and another one, by Carl Mayer, of the forestry resources.</p>
<p>Now what we did was to travel all over the country.  There were no roads in the interior.  There were no paved roads in Liberia at that time, except for about 20 feet in front of the president's mansion.  There were these laterite roads, you know, gravel, laterite, dusty roads from Roberts Field, the Firestone Plantation, up to Monrovia, which is about a distance of 40 miles.  And the only other passable road was...you've never been to Liberia?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  No, I haven't.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  There was another road that extended inward about 20 additional miles.  So altogether there were hardly over 60 miles of roads over which you could use a Jeep or a car to travel on in all of Liberia.  And all the other places you had to go, you had to walk.</p>
<p>So I would maybe spend as much as three to four weeks in the interior—walking for 20 or 30 miles a day—collect information, make notes, and return.</p>
<p>When I would go out, I would have to have a lot of what we called local employees to go with me.  And I'd have to carry enough money to buy food for them, to feed them while I was on these field trips.  We couldn't use paper money; it would have to be coins, and we'd have to carry that in on the heads, in metal cases.  You'd have to take maybe four or five hundred dollars in change, and that's pretty heavy.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Sounds like a safari.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
<p>REED:  It was.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And it wasn't dangerous, carrying that money around?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  I never lost any money.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, that's an interesting way to see the country.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I did that in Nepal years ago.  The only way to get around was to walk.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  That's right.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You were there two years.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  It was actually almost two and a half years.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And the team eventually issued an overall report?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  I never saw an overall report.  I think everything we did was monthly reports and provide additional information.  In fact, I was asked to stay on six months longer than I had planned.  During the period we were in Liberia, President Truman made his Point Four speech, and we were asked to make recommendations as to how that program might be applied to Liberia.  So we made... recommendations.  In fact, at that time, there were only two programs worldwide that carried out the idea of what we were doing in Liberia.  There was our program in Liberia, and I think there was one in Indonesia at the time.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So you were in on one of the earliest AID efforts.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  That's right.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Give me an idea of some of the other disciplines that were represented on the team.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
<p>REED:  We had two civil engineers.  We had a fisheries expert.  That program never materialized, because the fisheries expert was drowned.  We never found him.  It started out there were two. The chief one died. The boat capsized.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  In a river or the ocean?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  In the ocean.  He was lost, so I think that program was aborted completely.  We had one forestry man.  We had a tropical horticulturist.  Later we had an education consultant.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It sounds like a prototype of an AID mission.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  Except we didn't have programs defined and really developed.  The only thing that resembled a current AID mission was this small contingent.  We had two agricultural extension workers there, and another fellow by name of Forbes, and they carried on a type of educational program, trying to teach the farmers how to produce more food, and introduced some of the improved foods.  But it wasn't an AID mission.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  No, I know.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  But some of the ideas, yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Generally speaking, what were your determinations?  What did you determine, that Liberia was creditworthy or not?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  Well, the more information we got, the more hopeful we were about their potential of repaying the loan.</p>
<p>A number of things happened after we arrived.  A road was constructed after the port was completed.  The port actually was the thing that resulted in real economic growth.  When that port was constructed, a road was built from Monrovia all the way through the interior, on up into what was French Guinea then.  It opened that highway, and the amount of exports that went through that port increased so much that I think they repaid the loan in less than ten years.</p>
<p>And there was another thing that resulted in the economic growth of the country: the development of iron ore.  We didn't have that much to do with that part; that somewhat preceded our arrival.  The Bomi Hills iron ore project also resulted in a lot of economic growth.</p>
<pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
<p>I did some reporting on the mineral potential of the country, but I wasn't a trained geologist.  In my reports I mentioned that there appeared to be other mineral rich areas.  So, in addition to the Bomi Hills mine, there were about three other areas where they established mining operations.</p>
<p>So there was quite a bit of economic growth in the country.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, one last question on that.  You never did really have much to do with the embassy, then, while you were there?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  All of us had to go through the embassy.  The embassy didn't supervise us, but all the communication had to go through the embassy.  The embassy was very small.  When we were there, we didn't have an embassy; it was a legation first.  I think it only had two officers and several secretaries and that type of thing, and then the minister.  The legation was elevated to an embassy while I was there.  The first ambassador was Dudley, who was a lawyer.  He came there as a minister.  The reason the original minister left was the fact he was so sure President Truman wouldn't be elected that he took a job in the States.  Dudley came, and shortly after Truman was elected it was elevated to embassy status.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  A lot of people backed the wrong horse in 1948.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  That's right.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So you left Liberia and returned to teaching.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  Yes.  I didn't go back to my original job.  I was offered a job in North Carolina as dean of the school of agriculture at A&amp;T.  At Southern University I was just a department head.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  North Carolina A&amp;T is one of the state's predominantly black institutions.  And it was totally black, I guess, then.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  Then it was, except we brought in a white teacher while I was there, a teacher of forestry.  But all the members of the faculty were black then.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You were quite young to be a dean, were you not?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  I was about 35 or 36.  That isn't too young, is it?  Harvard brought in a president when he was 30, wasn't he?</p>
<pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, and sometimes outstanding soldiers will make general at 24 and so forth.  But, generally speaking, it's fairly young, I'd say.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  I got my Ph.D. when I was 32 or 33.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, your next overseas assignment, then, was to Togo.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  No, to Ghana.  In this, I was asked to head the team.  It was a contract program by the International Development Service.  It was not AID, but the ICA Administration, wasn't it, then?  The International Development Service had a contract with ICA to aid Ghana in the development of what was called land planning and control of blood disease in livestock, in cattle.  This program had been recommended, prior to Ghana's independence, by the British.  So they had had to ask the United States government to provide assistance.  What they wanted was a Civilian Conservation Corps type of young people to help them with this area.  In the northern part of Ghana, there are maybe five months of wet weather and then about seven months of extremely dry weather.  During the dry period, there is a lot of suffering because of lack of water and lack of vegetables.  They could eat the guinea corn and things of that nature, but not fresh vegetables, so children became constipated and malnourished.  So there was an effort to develop a system of water conservation.  They called it land planning, but it was more or less like soil conservation work, where we'd build dams and improve the grazing places for pastures as well as to provide production of food. The livestock program was designed to vaccinate the animals and to dip them so they'd get rid of the ticks.  When you'd drive in cattle from Upper Volta to Lagos, which is a distance of maybe 300 miles, they'd die of trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness caused by the tsetse fly) and blood and bone diseases.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What years were you in Ghana?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  I was in there for two years, from November 1957 to the fall of 1959.  That was a very successful program, but it was one of the most difficult assignments I've had in my life because of the responsibility I had.  I had what you'd call planning areas, and I had an American office in each one of those areas.  I had to supervise the technical aspects of the work and try to ensure that the money was properly managed and spent.  They only thing the U.S. government provided was the salaries of the technicians.  The Ghana government provided all of the other support, the equipment and everything that we used.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You got good cooperation?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
<p>REED:  I had excellent cooperation from the government.  You should see some of the letters that they wrote about the success.  While I was there, we built 49 dams. The results were what they considered almost miraculous in terms of the returns.  Now after two years, I returned to my job in North Carolina, but the program was continued for several more years; then AID took over the program.  There was no AID for people there when I arrived.  They only direct support I had was through the embassy.  Of course, we were American citizens and that type of thing.  But the AID program in Washington was very much interested in what we did.  The second year after I arrived there, a team was sent out to explore the possibilities of setting up an AID mission.  A man by the name of Moffit made this survey for AID, and later he was made the mission director of the AID program for a couple of years.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Originally it was a contract operation.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  At first, I was a contract employee.  I think one of the things that attracted me to go back into the Foreign Service was the success I had there.  At first, AID offered me a job to be in charge of the agricultural programs in all of West Africa.  But when the administrator, I was told, got my r�sum� and my background information, he said, “We'd like to have Reed as a mission director.” So that's when I moved really from being what you'd call a technician into administration.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So you went to Lom� in '61, is that it?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  I never got to Lom�.  I was in language training for four or five months, and then President Kennedy indicated he wanted to concentrate on Nigeria.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I didn't know that.  I don't remember anything about that.  What was the reason?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  For one thing, De Gaulle didn't want very much help done in Togo; he wanted to control that.  De Gaulle was very much against Americans moving into the former French colonies.  That was one reason.  And then the president wanted to really concentrate on Nigeria, because it had such potential.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Because it was such a big country.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  Big country and it had so much greater potential.  There was much more money.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It still does have great potential—unrealized.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
<p>REED:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So then you went to Ibadan.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  As a regional assistant director.  Actually, at one time, I had as many a 125 technicians there, and that many families, so it was a big program.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  In those days, we had a consulate general there, too, did we not?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  Well, they didn't call it a consulate general.  He was the consular officer.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, it was maybe perhaps just a consulate, then.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  A consulate, that's what it was.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Later on, I think it was a consulate general.  And now it doesn't exist; there is only a USIA office.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  I think you have consulates general only where you don't have the embassies.  Isn't that right?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  No, you can have a consulate general that's attached to an embassy as well.  In Paris, for example.  And now in Ibadan there is only the USIA representative, no consular officer at all any more.  You had 125 technicians.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  At one time.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It's an important area.  And Ibadan, unknown to many people, but of course well known to you, is a very big city.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  Oh, yes, it was considered the largest city in Black Africa.  But when I went there, of course I had Benin also under my authority...is it Benin State now?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, they change the names of the states so often.  It probably is still Benin State.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
<p>REED:  Well, Benin was in the western region when I was there.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So you had all of the western region, then?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  I had all the western region, including Lagos.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What was the main thrust of your AID effort there?  Were you concentrating on agriculture, or concentrating on water resources, or...?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  There were four areas: agriculture; education— primary, secondary, and university education; we had also Arthur Delow's team on industrial development; and we had of course the Ibadan water supply system — that was, I think, about a thirty-million-dollar project — while I was there.  We started a demonstration type of school for Iatoria, a secondary school.  It was supposed to be different from the traditional type of secondary education.  We had university contract teams, and about an equal number of what we called direct-hire contract employees.  The first contract was with Ohio University; that was to improve teacher training.  We had one with Western Michigan University to improve the technical training in the engineering and technical college.  We had Harvard University to help with...it's kind of odd, but help with the Iatoria team.  The contract was with Harvard University, but Harvard had a contract with a school system in Massachusetts that provided staff for that project.  The University of Wisconsin had the contract with the university at Ife to help with the development of the college that developed at Ife.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  The university at Ibadan had been there quite some years, but the one at Ife was set up while you were at Ibadan, I guess.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  We didn't have any direct support for the University of Ibadan.  The one at Ife was set up directly to help with the new university when it was moved.  Prior to that, there was a university, I think they called it University of Ife, but it was located in Ibadan.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, yes, that's true.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  But we didn't provide any assistance to that university until it was moved to the Ife campus.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  This a personal interest of mine.  What kind of assistance did you provide to the University of Ife?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  We provided a staff from the University of Wisconsin.  All of the heads of the departments were from the University of Wisconsin.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So it was technical assistance in the form of people.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  People, that's right.  I don't recall, I can't be too sure of my facts, but I think we provided some assistance in providing for laboratories and for libraries.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Now continuing on your time in Nigeria, you were the assistant AID director from '61 to what year was that?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  Sixty-eight.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Why, you were there quite a long time.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  I wasn't supposed to stay that long.  But what happened, the civil war broke out.  My replacement wasn't permitted to bring his wife with him.  And I was asked to stay on, I think, almost two years longer.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Your working relations there, and your personal life there also, must have been fairly pleasant.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  It was very comfortable.  One of the reasons that encouraged me to go there was I had two daughters that were in grade school then, about fourth or fifth grade, and the opportunity of placing them in better schools was one consideration.  Another thing, while we were there, we provided support to build an international school.  And I was one who had the responsibility for that project, along with the chief of education in Lagos.  In fact, I was on the Board for the whole time I was there.  At one time we had maybe 150 American children attending that school, the International School in Ibadan.  Those children came from posts in several other countries in Africa.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was your estimate of the future of Nigeria at that time quite optimistic because of oil...?</hi>
</p>

<p>REED:  Very optimistic at that time, yes, because while we were there, the oil resources were being developed.  The amount of oil exploration, the potential, increased.  So that was a factor.</p>
<p>Also, the International Research Center was established in Nigeria at the time I was there.  In fact, I don't think it would be immodest for me to say that I think I had some influence on helping Nigeria to get that center located in Nigeria.  A member of the team that located that center was my major professor at Cornell, Dr. Bradfield.  They made several trips to Nigeria while I was there.  There were two places that they had to make a decision on.  Of all the places, there were two places in the final.  One of them was located in Brazil, in Latin America, and then, in Africa, it would be Nigeria.  Kenya was considered, but they thought Nigeria, for Africa, was the number-one place.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, it's still the biggest.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  In '68, you moved over to deputy AID director in Ethiopia, at the rank of R-1.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  That's right.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And you were there how long?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  I was there for four years.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You stayed there until '72.  We don't need to go into programs, but could you describe for the record what a deputy AID director usually is expected to do?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  Well, my responsibility in Ethiopia was to supervise all of the divisional chiefs, and to run the mission in the absence of the director.  While I was there, the mission director was ill on two or three occasions, and I had to serve as director in his absence.  Or when he was out of the country, I had to take his place.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Who was the mission director when you went there?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  It was Roger Ernst.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  He was your director the whole time?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I suppose it depends to some extent on what the mission director wants you to do, but would you describe the position of the deputy as one who is in charge of the day-to-day operation of the whole mission, as in the case of executive officers in the Navy?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  Well, let's see how you place that.  We worked as a team.  The mission director and I got along very well.  But you have also the ambassador.  Ambassador Hall was an AID man, so the ambassador knew both William Reed and Roger Ernst directly.  It so happened that Roger wasn't as good in handling people, in supervising them, as I was.  I mean, this was the feeling of Ambassador Hall, so I had to handle a lot of the relationship problems with the staff.  But the mission director, of course, had the responsibility of making recommendations to the ambassador and to Washington.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was this William O. Hall?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I remember the name.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  He's dead now.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So you were there four years.  That's a good long tour, probably with one home leave in there somewhere.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  Yes, I was on home leave during that period.  Roger was on home leave also.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  After Ethiopia, did you return to North Carolina then?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  I came as officer-in-residence, similar to the diplomats-in-residence.  I was in one of the first groups.  I had been out of the country continuously for about 11 years, except for home leave.  And I was offered this assignment.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Where was that?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
<p>REED:  Here in Greensboro.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, at A&amp;T.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  At A&amp;T.  I had indicated three locations: A&amp;T, the University of Wisconsin, and Michigan State.  We had had contact with Wisconsin and Michigan State. In Nigeria, in my area, Michigan State was at the University of Nsukka.  So I had indicated three areas, but for some reason I felt that, because I had previously been at A&amp;T, I wouldn't be given that assignment at A&amp;T.  But, as I said, I'm here, and it suited me fine, because I had a home that I wanted to check on, that type of thing.  I was supposed to have been here for about a year, and I was ready to go back, but the president (then, it was president instead of chancellor as we have today) wanted me to stay on for another year.  I told him I didn't think that AID would approve another year.  But he said, “Would you permit me to request it?  Would you agree to it?”</p>
<p>I said, “Well, I'll see.  I wouldn't mind staying.”</p>
<p>But, anyway, he wrote a nice letter about what I was doing.  AID sent an evaluation team.  There were two assignments made: one at Michigan State, and I at A&amp;T.  Well, Dr. Dowdey, who was the president at the time, indicated what I was doing.  Actually, when I came here, I knew Dr. Dowdey, and I knew the vice president for academics affairs.  I was asked to take over the program in international affairs, representing the university.  Then we had, with the general university, an international program promoting all of the 16 units of the system.  So I was asked to take over that.  That was the period that consolidation started in the university system.  I also taught two classes.  I wasn't required to do it, but they asked me to do it.  And I found it stimulating to do that.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How long were you here, then, on that assignment?  Another year?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  Well, I did another year on that assignment, then there was a period in which there was a bit of turbulence in Washington, during the Watergate thing, and the situation was not too bright in AID at the time.  I was asked by NABSA (National Association of Black...) if I would work with the traditional black universities in trying to improve their international education programs.</p>
<pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
<p>AID paid my total salary for two years.  I had no reimbursement from the university.  The only thing the university provided me was office space and secretarial help.  This particular unit working with the black universities couldn't provide funding.  It received some support from the federal government.  AID asked them to reimburse AID for half of my salary.  So they couldn't get the money for that.  They tried to get money from the Rockefeller Foundation or Ford Foundation, but couldn't get it.  I was getting ready to go back to Washington, but Dr. Dowdey said, “Would you stay on and work for A&amp;T.  I'd like for you to continue here.”</p>
<p>So I said, “Yes, I'll stay.”</p>
<p>He said, “I'll pay you half of the salary.”</p>
<p>So they reimbursed AID, and I worked two more years, until '76.  Then I went back in '76.</p>
<p>Next, I was being considered to work with the auditor general, where I would travel to the various AID missions, because of my experience, to make a... report and bring it back and report to the administrator of AID.  But with that program I'd have to travel a lot; I couldn't take my wife with me.  In the meantime she had started working here at A&amp;T.  And I was about getting to the age where I was thinking about retiring anyway.  So AID wanted me to return, but I said... A&amp;T wanted me to continue to work here.  So I was offered a job here, and I retired from AID after 27 years, and came back here and worked for eight more years as director of international programs and as an associate dean for research.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And so now you're playing golf.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  No, I don't play golf.  I do some volunteer work for some... fraternities and that type of thing.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  We've been going at this for some time, so I think maybe we'll wind it up.  Let me ask you two last questions.  One is, What do you look back upon as your greatest accomplishment while in the Foreign Service?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  Oh, I think the selection and training of foreign nationals.  I believe that would be the...</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Any particular country, or all of them?</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  Well, in Liberia my greatest accomplishment was more or less in scientific development.  My publication was the first really scientific study of the soils in West Africa, and it was a publication that was in great demand.</p>
<pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
<p>It was rather interesting.  Recently, after I retired, I attended two meetings.  A professor at the University of Minnesota had a meeting which the chancellor of A&amp;T and I attended.  We were asked to tell something about ourselves, and I mentioned that I had made a soil survey of Liberia.  And then this professor said, “Are you the Dr. Reed that was in Liberia?  Do you know that that was a primary reference for my Ph.D. work in geography.”</p>
<p>And then I had a Liberian visit me while I was at A&amp;T.  The wife of this man was a visiting scholar with the Phelps-Stokes Fund.  Her husband had a Ph.D. in geology from the University of Chicago, and when he was introduced to me, he said, “Are you Dr. Reed?  Do you know, that publication gave me the idea for my Ph.D. thesis.  My Ph.D. thesis was on the laterites of Liberia, and that was the basic reference for that work.”</p>
<p>So I would consider that as one of my achievements in the technical and scientific field.</p>
<p>And also, in Ghana, where I developed the land development program and development of water reservoirs, dams and... I trained people in that.  Early on, I was a skilled person in soil conservation; I learned that back in 1935.  As a town agent I was very proficient, in each of the parishes of Louisiana, in terracing land and that work.  The county commissioners provided me with two people who would construct the terraces, and thus soil conservation, on the basis of my instructions, the way I'd lay it out.  And I would think that was why I was invited to come to the university to work.</p>
<p>Now in administration, certainly in Nigeria I think I was helpful in improving the educational system while I was there, working with the Nigerians in particular.  The universities I worked with, I had good relations with them.</p>
<p>I think AID considered me to be an effective officer.  I served on more evaluation panels than perhaps anyone at the time.  I evaluated number-three officers, number-two officers, and number-one officers while I was working with AID... three panels.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, it was certainly a full career, that covered everything from technician's responsibilities right up to the top of the heap, including an offer which you didn't accept, that is, to be an inspector.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  That's right.  The reason I didn't accept it was because I couldn't leave my wife.  I knew she wouldn't be happy.  Her health wasn't the best...</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  One final question.  Really it's to cover me.  Is there something I should have asked that I didn't?  Is there something you'd like to say?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
<p>REED:  I don't know of anything.  I believe you've covered quite comprehensively all I'd like to say.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, that's good, then, because I've been keeping you for quite some time.  I want to thank you, though, for your time.</hi>
</p>
<p>REED:  Could I get you something to drink or something?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  No, no.  Thank you again, Dr. Reed.  I'll break it off here.</hi>
</p>
