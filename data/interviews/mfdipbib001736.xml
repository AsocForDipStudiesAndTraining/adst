                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 25th of February 1998. This is an interview
                        with Ints M. Silins. This is being done on behalf of the Association for
                        Diplomatic Studies and Training and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Well, to begin with, can you tell me about when and where you were born and
                    something about your family?</p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes. I was born in Riga, Latvia on March 25, 1942. Not perhaps the most
                    auspicious time and place to enter the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think I know what you mean.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes, at the time of my birth Latvia was being battered from both sides by
                    the two arch-villains of the 20th century, Hitler and Stalin. By the end of
                    World War II, Latvia was to lose not only its independence but roughly a third
                    of its population to execution, deportation or emigration. It was hard to see
                    that this story would have a happy ending. In fact, the day of my birth, March
                    25, was to become a national day of mourning, to mark the deportation of over
                    40,000 people to Siberia in 1949. Latvia's story isn't too well known, so
                    perhaps you'll forgive me if I sketch some of the background.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Latvia first won independence in1920. Just two decades later, it was occupied and
                    annexed by Soviet Russia after a deal between Hitler and Stalin, the infamous
                    Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. That occupation was accompanied and followed by
                    executions and deportations and a harsh internal regime that made most Latvians
                    very anxious to avoid a repetition if they could. Germany invaded the following
                    year as Hitler's forces pressed their assault on Soviet Russia. The Germans
                    weren't a great improvement on the Russians. They compelled able-bodied Latvian
                    men, my father among them, to serve on the eastern front. Nevertheless many
                    Latvians, while they had no love for fascism, saw Germany as the only possible
                    counterforce to Stalin and hoped to develop an independent military force that,
                    with eventual help from the Allies, might keep Russia at bay.</p>
                <p>The Germans were in control of Latvia at the time of my birth in 1942. But in
                    1944 Germany's defeat was looming, as was the likelihood that the Russians would
                    be coming back to re-impose their brutal regime. So when I was just two, my
                    mother and I joined thousands of other Latvians who fled the country as best
                    they could, mostly to Sweden or Germany. We made our way to Germany and ended up
                    spending five years there in various displaced person camps - DP camps, as they
                    were called, eventually in the American zone. My father remained in Latvia with
                    other soldiers holding out in the hope that the Allies would come to their aid.
                    That help did not come. They were taken prisoner by Russian troops and sent to
                    Siberia. A few years later, he died in a Soviet death camp.</p>
                <p>I have almost no reliable memories from my first two years in Latvia and only
                    sketchy ones from the DP camps in Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the background of your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: To tell you the truth, I don't know a great deal about the background of
                    my family. I know that my father was a trained agronomist, but I have no
                    personal recollection of him since I probably only saw him fleetingly as an
                    infant. My mother, I think, worked for the government in some capacity. On my
                    mother's side, my grandfather had a senior position in the ministry of
                    agriculture. He also owned a small farm, about 75 acres, not far from Riga in a
                    town with the interesting name of Ogre, and that's where there are some pictures
                    of me as a little kid, two years and younger, being chased by geese and that
                    sort of thing. On my father's side, my grandfather was a notary and owned an
                    attractive wooden house near the center of Riga that now houses a music school.
                    So it was a family with some roots in the countryside and farming as well as
                    having some professional education and working for the government too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know anything about the details of your mother
                        going with you to Germany, and were there any other children?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>SILINS: There were no other children. I was an only child, and since I was only
                    two years old when we left Latvia I don't have any recollection of what happened
                    in Latvia before we left. It might seem odd that I know so little about it now,
                    but after I was old enough to talk to my mother about such things, this is now
                    of course in the States, when I asked about our life in Latvia and what happened
                    to my father and so forth, it was obviously very stressful for her, it would
                    make her cry, and so I learned to avoid the subject.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is often the case in so many families who went
                        through that, you know, horrendous time. When do you start remembering
                        things, what do you remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, I remember quite a lot beginning with our arrival in the United
                    States. I remember the trip to the U.S. vividly. We were very fortunate; we got
                    a seat on a returning American plane, we didn't even have to go by ship as did
                    most refugees, we flew to the U.S. I was just seven years old at the time, and
                    that was very exciting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would have been about '49?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Summer of '49, July of '49.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be under the Displaced Persons Act or something
                        like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I believe so, and thanks also to the Lutheran Relief Service. We had
                    found a sponsor, or rather a sponsor family had been found for us. A wonderful
                    Quaker couple, the Arthur Silvers, had sponsored us, meaning that they offered
                    my mother a job and a place for us to live. And so we got seats on the plane. I
                    still remember staying awake the whole flight, gazing out the window at the
                    magical clouds. I remember we stopped off at Gander and then flew into New York
                    City. So that was very exciting, I've loved flying ever since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go? Where were the Silvers located?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>SILINS: They had a country place in Darlington, Maryland, not too far from
                    Baltimore, although I think their main home was in Philadelphia, where we
                    visited them much later. My mother had been meant to care for one of the
                    Silvers' elderly parents, but the lady died just before we reached the U.S. My
                    mother then worked for a year or so for two schoolteachers in Towson, Maryland,
                    the McGuigan sisters. Then she was hired as a cook and housekeeper by Guy
                    Holliday, who was administrator of the FHA, the Federal Housing Administration.
                    He had a sizeable farm, also near Towson, with a stable of horses. His daughter
                    Pat taught riding. I too learned to ride there and even had my designated pony,
                    Puss N'Boots. All these were wonderful places so I've been very lucky as a kid
                    as to where I lived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like you grew up around horses.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Oh, it was fantastic, really, and it gets better as we go but it started
                    off very well too. Needless to say, the picture was not quite so rosy from my
                    mother's point of view. She had gone from a comfortable middle-class life in
                    Latvia to being a servant, basically, until her English was strong enough for
                    her to get back into white-collar work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in Maryland, where did you go to school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I attended Towson public elementary school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problem with the language?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I knew only a few words of English when I came to the States in July of
                    '49 and I certainly did have trouble when I first started school that September,
                    but because I'd learned to read in Latvian during our time in DP camps I quickly
                    rose to the Dick and Jane level of reading in English. So I was moved up to the
                    second grade after a few months. I still have an oddly vivid memory of the day I
                    was first brought to the second-grade classroom. The teacher evidently didn't
                    know how to fit me in immediately, so she told me to sit in the back and write
                    down numbers on a sheet of paper, starting with one and going as high as I
                    could. I think I reached 149. Pretty soon I spoke English okay, but with an
                    accent, of course, for the first few years, and I remember being teased a bit
                    about that. Mostly people thought I was German, which was not a great thing to
                    be at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure trying to explain Latvia was no better.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: It was beyond my powers.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, pretty much through your elementary education you were
                        in Maryland schools?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Right up through junior high school we were in the general
                    Baltimore-Washington area. By the time I was in junior high school we had moved
                    to, let's see, Riverdale, Maryland, which is on the outskirts of Washington, and
                    I was going to Greenbelt Junior High, about which I remember just three or four
                    things: pitching pennies and playing mumblety-peg with pocketknives during
                    recess; a band instructor, Mr. Dawson, who was mercilessly tormented by his
                    students; sitting in the back of the classroom a lot doing “independent reading”
                    as the class focused on something I was presumed to know; and an outstanding,
                    pretty English teacher.</p>
                <p>Then something really quite remarkable happened, namely, I was discovered by an
                    American millionaire. His name was Keith Merrill and he and his wife Katherine
                    Ayer Merrill had an enormous property in Fairfax County, Virginia. It was called
                    “Southdown.” It was truly vast; it must have been at least half a mile deep from
                    the road to the Potomac River. The property is still there and it still bears
                    the name Southdown, but it's been subdivided and in fact some Foreign Service
                    officers built homes there, for example, Warren Zimmerman, former ambassador to
                    Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes, I remember, it's on the Potomac.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Nearby is what has now become a famous regional restaurant, L'Auberge
                    Chez Francois. It occupies what used to be a general store, a gas station and
                    then briefly an antiques shop. Keith Merrill had Latvians working for him on his
                    estate. The man who ran for Merrill what was, I suppose, essentially a tax loss
                    farm, was a Latvian named Augusts Zauermanis. He was a wonderful local
                    character, very tough, colorfully profane, handy with machinery and firearms,
                    and a great drinker. A tempting role model, needless to say, for a teenage boy.
                    There was also a Latvian widow working on that property with a boy about two
                    years younger than I, named George Klints. Merrill apparently thought very
                    highly of them all and therefore became positively inclined toward Latvians in
                    general. Somehow my mother made contact with the Southdown Latvians and I began
                    going out there for extensive visits, especially in the summer. It was absolute
                    heaven for a teenager because it had horses, guns and farm machinery - it
                    offered both play and work. In other words, we could earn money, we did things
                    like weeding out the morning glories from the extensive rose hedges that lined
                    the estate's long drive, we painted farm buildings, we helped bring in the hay.
                    But we could also fool around with the farm Jeep or go fishing in the Potomac,
                    so it was just a boys' paradise. If there's a more fun way to learn to drive
                    than to be turned loose as a teenager, unsupervised, on a vast estate in a
                    four-wheel drive Jeep, I can't imagine what it could be. Luckily, neither our
                    reckless drives in the Jeep nor our other harebrained exploits, such as shooting
                    flaming kerosene out of water pistols, caused permanent damage. My accidentally
                    dropping a knife, point down, from a tree on George's head came close,
                    though.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how long did this go on? Did you start high school by
                        this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I'd been going out to Southdown for a couple of years and was in the
                    seventh or eighth grade, junior high school, when Keith Merrill asked to see my
                    mother and me. He had gotten the idea of sending a Latvian boy to the school
                    that he had attended, a boarding school called The Hill School in Pottstown,
                    Pennsylvania. My friend George was still too young. I remember the interview
                    with Merrill in his big, imposing house overlooking a pond. Merrill - or
                    Commander Merrill, as he preferred to be addressed from his Navy service - was a
                    country squire very much in the English style. He sported a fine silver
                    moustache and drove a Jaguar when in Virginia. Until, that is, he accidentally
                    ran over a favorite dog, a boxer, at Southdown. He got rid of the Jag
                    immediately. He and his wife also owned homes in Prides Crossing, Massachusetts
                    and at St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands. I remember being pretty intimidated
                    by the circumstances and was rather tongue-tied at the interview. Nevertheless I
                    apparently passed his first scrutiny, and I know he was impressed with my
                    mother. Then I had to take an admissions exam for Hill, which I also passed but
                    not without anxiety since a lot was riding on this for me. And then I was
                    admitted to Hill. My tuition there was paid not by Keith Merrill but from a
                    General Motors scholarship. The Hill School was very small, only about 430
                    students all told, but at that time it was a really exceptionally good private
                    school in Pottstown, Pennsylvania.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were at The Hill School from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I was there for three academic years and graduated in 1960, so it must
                    have been from '57 to '60.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you describe the atmosphere of the school and the
                        faculty and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes. The headmaster was named Edward Tuck Hall and he was an
                    exceptionally competent and inspiring headmaster, normally appearing with a pipe
                    clenched firmly between his teeth. His background was St. Mark's and Yale. He
                    was making Hill into a model educational institution. My studies at Hill
                    coincided with the whole Sputnik crisis in American education - that is, when
                    the launching of the Soviet space satellite convinced us that the U.S. was
                    falling behind in the sciences. The Hill School was one of those schools that
                    became a laboratory for science teaching, the so-called PSSC (Physical Science
                    Study Committee) approach to science teaching. Hill had gotten some extra
                    funding and some good teachers and a good program. Academically it reached the
                    cutting edge, as shown by its success in getting graduates into the leading
                    universities. For example, when I graduated in 1960 my class had 123 students.
                    Of those over 20 went to Yale, over 20 went to Princeton and five or so went to
                    Harvard. For a school of that size that was just exceptional.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: The general atmosphere there, of course, was upper middle class. Most
                    kids came from well-off families, some extremely so, with just a sprinkling of
                    paupers like me. A few obsessed about their clothing but overall there was a
                    minimum of snobbism and broad mixing, fostered in part by a vigorous sports
                    program. I remember visiting one classmate whose parents' upper-floor apartment
                    on Park Avenue seemed to cover an entire city block. I was certainly not at the
                    cutting edge socially there, in fact, particularly the first year I felt very
                    out of it. But I liked it very much right from the beginning because it was so
                    good academically, it was not so snobbish that I couldn't make friends, and it
                    clearly represented a very lucky break for me. I do remember a few classmates
                    showing dismay at my grades the first year, because apparently a Gentleman's C
                    was still supposed to be the thing that you did and I started getting pretty
                    good grades right from the start. But it was a wonderful little school enjoying
                    what in retrospect was probably its Golden Age. One of the very best things that
                    ever happened to me. It really got me started academically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes. Well really it's the high school or the prep
                        school that often makes the man or the woman, much more so than the
                        university.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I think that's often the case. And Hill worked hard at it, stressing the
                    importance of character and values in addition to academics. Hill was modeled on
                    an idealized version of a British public school - without the hazing, canings
                    and other nastiness that apparently were all too common in English “public” i.e.
                    private schools, but with the same declared mission of shaping boys into men
                    with desirable characters. The “character-building” part of the Hill program,
                    with the discipline and restrictions that it entailed, did begin to seem more
                    confining and even claustrophobic to me by my final year there. After all, the
                    '60s were upon us. I responded in the usual way with minor pranks and
                    rebellions, for one of which I was sentenced to a job swabbing down the
                    wrestling mats in the gym every week.</p>
                <p>I now look on that process far more favorably - that is, the process of
                    character-building, of inducing children to internalize values such as honesty,
                    diligence, responsibility and generosity. The goal is to make them part of a
                    person's identity, part of who you are, not things that have to be constantly
                    enforced from outside. Working on the problem of corruption after my retirement
                    has persuaded me that this creation of a social conscience is essential. Until
                    most people have internalized such values, there cannot be enough police in the
                    world to enforce them. And who will police the police?</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>There is a novel, Old School by Tobias Wolff, loosely based on The Hill School
                    around the time I was there. It's fiction, of course, and not meant to be a
                    reliable guide to what Hill was really like, although Wolff himself attended
                    Hill. The book's cover photo, though, is genuine and gave me a real twinge of
                    nostalgia. Taken from ceiling height, it shows the boys seated for dinner at
                    white-covered tables in the wood-paneled dining room of The Headmaster's House,
                    in coats and ties, their heads bowed during grace, a master seated at each end
                    of the table. For all I know, I am somewhere in that picture. It certainly seems
                    to be from a previous century, and it cannot be repeated because, sad to say,
                    The Headmaster's House burned down many years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved with the sciences or what courses were
                        you taking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: At Hill I was interested in both the sciences and in the liberal arts, as
                    I am to this day. Hill had a two-year program called The Humanities, taught by
                    an excellent teacher, Paul Chancellor, which covered literature and the
                    classics, music, art and architecture. That course helped to civilize me a bit.
                    As for languages, I studied Latin and German and wish now that I had studied
                    ancient Greek as well. I took chemistry, physics, 'earth science' and some
                    calculus under the PSSC program, which featured fascinating lab experiments.
                    Indeed when I graduated I was planning to major in the sciences and decided to
                    go to Princeton because it is very strong in both science and the liberal arts.
                    Originally I was going to be an engineer but by the time I actually got to
                    Princeton I thought, well, physics really has a somewhat wider scope and is more
                    up my alley. In fact I changed course by 180 degrees by the time I graduated,
                    winding up in philosophy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Hill, was the world intruding at all? This was during
                        the '60s, well, the '50s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: No, the world was not intruding so much at Hill. Hill was up on its
                    little hill. It was quite cut off from the rest of the world, which was not then
                    as turbulent as it became later in the '60s. The town in which Hill is situated
                    was not a magnet to the average Hill student. In fact, we were limited in how
                    often we could go there. Only in the sixth form - the senior year - did you have
                    some freedom of movement, and then the wealthier kids of course went to New
                    York, not to Pottstown. But no, Hill was really a self-contained academic
                    community, which happened to suit me to a T. I loved that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did John O'Hara, wasn't he the man from Pottstown or
                        something? The short story writer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: From somewhere in Pennsylvania but I think not necessarily Pottstown.
                    Pottstown, let's see, there's a baseball player whose name I now forget that was
                    from Pottstown, and Pottstown was the home of Kiwi Shoe Polish, and that's about
                    all I knew about it.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what type books were you reading, what you were
                        doing it for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I think then as now I was pretty omnivorous. At Hill our assigned reading
                    load was pretty heavy and I don't remember much of what I read on the side.
                    Plato's Socratic Dialogues made a strong impression on me. That obviously
                    affected my eventual turn to the study of philosophy. Socrates' search for
                    wisdom through dialogue captured my imagination. I still value the Socratic
                    method highly as a way to expose internal inconsistencies in one's thinking, but
                    now the scientific method and pragmatic investigation - that is, learning from
                    the world around us rather than just analyzing ideas and concepts - seem to me
                    just as important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, at Princeton, I guess you were there from '60 to
                        '64, was that it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I should have graduated in '64 but I took a year off and graduated in
                    '65.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Princeton, you said you started off intending to be an
                        engineer and then to study physics. What turned you around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Rightly or wrongly, I thought engineering would be too confining for me.
                    My interest in physics developed very promisingly at first when I was picked for
                    an honors course taught in part by John Wheeler, one of America's most brilliant
                    physicists and a marvelous teacher whom I still revere. Well, I loved that
                    course, which included doing classic experiments like measuring the speed of
                    light (the Michelson-Morley experiment) and the charge on the electron (the
                    Millikan oil drop experiment) and some study of relativity theory too. The
                    realization soon dawned on me, however, that I was not in the same league as the
                    brighter students in that group. The real coup de grace, though, came from
                    another honors course into which I was placed, a super-accelerated calculus
                    course. It's a course that Princeton subsequently abandoned; it did in half a
                    year the amount of calculus that most universities cover in two years. For me it
                    was a mistake. I'd had some calculus at Hill and thought I had a fairly good
                    grasp of it, but I wasn't brilliant at it and that's what you had to be. By the
                    end of the course my head was barely above water. So that really got me
                    thinking, because of course math is absolutely vital in physics. The decisive
                    moment came when we were studying the kinetic theory of gases. I was trying to
                    derive the formula relating the temperature and pressure of a gas in a confined
                    space from the physics of the movement of molecules, and the solution just
                    refused to take shape in my mind. And about that time, perhaps because of the
                    stress, I came down with ... Do you remember how it used to be popular to have
                    an attack of mononucleosis?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes. That was the student's disease.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>SILINS: Right, right. Well, I got that, whatever it is, and withdrew from
                    Princeton in the fall of my sophomore year. My first sophomore year, that is,
                    since I came back to repeat it the next fall. It was probably more of an
                    intellectual crisis than a physical one, but it was hitting me at a visceral
                    level that I was heading in the wrong direction and so my body as well as my
                    mind said whoa, you've got to do something else, you've got to work this out.
                    And so I took a leave of absence from Princeton, Princeton's very understanding
                    about these things. I went back to Washington, which is where my mother was
                    living at that time, and found a job, a wonderful job, at the old Washington
                    Evening Star newspaper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: A wonderful place to start off. A fairly sedate paper for the reader, but
                    for young reporters it was superb because at that time people like Haynes
                    Johnson and Dave Broder and Mary McGrory were there, the editors were sharp and
                    willing to give pointers, so it was a great school of journalism. My position
                    was called dictationist. I had started off as copy boy for a month; a copy boy
                    simply distributes stuff and responds instantly to a shout of “COPY!” from a
                    reporter or editor. A dictationist at the Star, which was an afternoon
                    newspaper, sat at a U-shaped desk surrounding a telephone switchboard, strapped
                    on a headset attached to a phone line and typed out news stories dictated by
                    reporters who didn't have time to get back to the office. What came from our
                    typewriters normally went to the rewrite desk for a final polish, then to the
                    appropriate editor, then to the copy desk, and then to the composing room via a
                    Rube Goldberg endless-belt conveyor, to be set in hot-lead Linotype. The idea
                    was to get the story to press for the evening edition. Today's news today. That
                    was the basic function, and it sometimes involved giving the reporter a hand in
                    writing up his material or doing instant research for him or her. There were
                    about half a dozen dictationists. One was Carl Bernstein, who became famous with
                    Bob Woodward for their Watergate revelations as investigative reporters for the
                    Washington Post. We also did some cub reporting and we did obituaries and we did
                    feature stories. And I remember every week going to cover citizens' associations
                    and reporting on them, their discussions about urban renewal or other
                    neighborhood issues. All this time I was bombing around in an olive drab 1950
                    Dodge that I had bought for $100, from a lady on her deathbed at the National
                    Institutes of Health. And it was just a wonderful job, it was really a great
                    thing. I almost decided to go into journalism as a result of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you did that what, for about a year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I did that for most of a year before I went back to Princeton, and then I
                    worked at the Star for the two summers after my sophomore and junior years.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, when I went back, as I said, I changed direction and went into
                    philosophy, which actually isn't that different from the sciences because it
                    also involves a lot of analysis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What attracted you to philosophy? Many of the people one
                        runs into in the Foreign Service may take political science or history, but
                        philosophy is not a prime subject.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes, it's not a leading major, is it? My basic reason for studying it was
                    to hone my own thinking, to be able to think more clearly, spot false arguments,
                    understand better the relations between ideas. I liked the fact that philosophy
                    potentially overlaps both science and the humanities. C. P. Snow's article about
                    the gap between the two cultures - science and the humanities - was a live
                    topic. Snow deplored how little members of each culture knew about the basics of
                    the other, with humanists being especially ignorant of elementary scientific
                    facts and principles. I wanted to become reasonably well educated about both.
                    And although I didn't really focus on the history of philosophy, I've always
                    been interested in the ancient Greeks and of course philosophy began with them.
                    Socrates is a big hero of mine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any particular field of philosophy that you
                        found yourself moving into?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Theory of value became my focus - philosophy of art and moral philosophy,
                    which I tried to relate in a disastrous senior paper. The core issues have to do
                    with how statements of value such as “he is a good man” or “this is a beautiful
                    piece of music” are related to statements of fact about those same things. Also
                    theory of knowledge, which our son Nicholas, who also went to Princeton and then
                    Oxford, now concentrates on as a professor of philosophy. And of course
                    philosophy of science, in which I took a course from the eminent Carl Hempel. I
                    still enjoy philosophy and I liked very much some of the people that I worked
                    with, that is, the professors at Princeton, one of whom is probably the person
                    most responsible for my going into the Foreign Service.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>That professor's name was Arthur Szathmary, and he was both a comic and a heroic
                    figure. Humor ran in his family, I guess. His brother was a professional
                    comedian, the man who created the once-popular Jose Jimenez character, and
                    Szathmary was himself very witty and amusing. Heroic because he had suffered a
                    stroke a few years earlier and had lost his ability to speak. He had to learn it
                    all over again and did it well enough to be able to continue to teach. He was
                    quite frail and walked with a slight limp, often using a cane. I remember
                    vividly one day, this would have been the spring of 1965, my last year at
                    Princeton. Professor Szathmary and I were taking a walk along Lake Carnegie and,
                    with my graduation approaching, chatting about my future. The U.S. was having a
                    crisis with the Dominican Republic. I believe we had just invaded it, actually.
                    When the subject came up, Professor Szathmary turned to me, leaned on his cane,
                    and said with an unusual emphasis, “You know, Ints, I think you could handle
                    that sort of thing better.” I took that to be his way of suggesting - you know,
                    philosophy may not be your destined field, why don't you see if you can make a
                    contribution in international affairs?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well again, I'll ask about the world intruding, as far as
                        what was happening. These were the Kennedy and Johnson years, there were
                        involvements with the Soviet Union, with Vietnam, the Dominican Republic and
                        all, Peace Corps and of course, here in the United States, the Civil Rights
                        Movement was getting cranked up. Did this impact much personally for
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I was committed at Princeton as I was at The Hill School to the notion of
                    a self-contained academic environment. Of course the external world would
                    intrude, but my belief at the time was that the intrusion should be minimal
                    because we were here for only a few years to study and learn and that's what I
                    was concentrating on. So I tried not to let it intrude any more than necessary.
                    Also, Princeton was perhaps less affected than some schools by what was going on
                    in the early '60s. The drug scene had not yet arrived or at least only in a very
                    limited way. Princeton was not co-educational, it had only the beginnings of a
                    female presence in the so-called Critical Language Program. I think in my senior
                    year the CLP only contained 14 women, so Princeton was still a men's school and
                    more inward looking than outward looking. My pact with myself was, I was going
                    to focus on academic things and then after I graduated, that would be the time
                    to deal with the outer world. It wasn't that I didn't want to deal with it at
                    all, I just didn't want to deal with it now, I didn't want to deal with it
                    then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, do you feel that something that often happens, a
                        young person, male or female, coming from a family that has emigrated and
                        starting all over again and not having a lot of money behind them, takes a
                        more serious look at the system and doesn't have the self-indulgence that
                        people who are sort of to the manor born have and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>SILINS: Well, that might be one generous way of describing it but there's another
                    way, and that is that someone like myself without any family money at all
                    appreciates more the environment of the university but also therefore relishes
                    it more, indulges more in it than others would who have a lot of other
                    interesting choices to go off to. Some of my friends went almost weekly to New
                    York. That was where they had a good time. I didn't have those options so I
                    tried to get the most out of my time in the, to me, idyllic setting of Princeton
                    University. Maybe it's worth mentioning that my son Nicholas, who had a... let's
                    say, more sophisticated childhood than I, growing up as a Foreign Service brat
                    and going to school in Port au Prince, Leningrad, Strasbourg and Stockholm, he
                    was far less star-struck by Princeton than I. In fact, he insisted on living off
                    campus. He even seemed pretty blas� later about Oxford.</p>
                <p>I don't mean to imply that I did nothing but study. I made some trips to New
                    York, a visit or two to nearby women's colleges, and I joined in the sometimes
                    excessive drinking at the occasional weekend parties at the university eating
                    clubs. I read the New York Times regularly and kept up with what was happening
                    in the world outside. But I felt no impulse to launch myself into that world
                    until my education was more complete.</p>
                <p>Civil rights? Well, in my sophomore year I did turn down an invitation to join
                    one of Princeton's top eating clubs when I learned it had voted not to admit one
                    of the university's few African-Americans, an outstanding young man, solely
                    because of his race. Their explanation was, sorry, it would upset the club's
                    numerous Southern alumni; that is, cause them to reduce the financial support
                    that enabled Cottage Club to maintain its status. I don't claim crusader status
                    on the basis of this act, however. The club across from it on Prospect Street
                    that I did join, Colonial Club, was architecturally the spitting image of a
                    Southern slave-owner's mansion and did not, as I recall, have any black members
                    when I joined.</p>
                <p>Drug use? Not by me, but if you were to examine a special edition of the Nassau
                    Lit dedicated to the critic R.P. Blackmur that I co-edited with Paul Boorstin,
                    you might wonder where the inspiration for its layout and design came from. It
                    was done by John Mason, and he never did explain what those creepy-crawly things
                    on the margins were supposed to be and why the format needed to be so large.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated in 1965. By that time, what were you
                        thinking of doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>SILINS: Well, I should have been thinking about the Foreign Service, which is
                    where Arthur Szathmary was trying to point me, but I decided to continue for a
                    bit with philosophy because I didn't feel I had a firm enough grip on it yet. At
                    first I thought, aha, why don't I go study Greek philosophy in Athens? A rather
                    na�ve idea that Gregory Vlastos, Princeton's philosophy department chairman,
                    himself Greek and one of the world's top experts on Greek philosophy, easily
                    talked me out of. With perhaps an assist from Stuart Hampshire, he arranged a
                    last-minute graduate position for me at University College London, where I began
                    to study British analytical philosophy under Richard Wollheim. But it was not
                    meant to be. My studies seemed repetitive to me, and then my stepfather died. My
                    mother a few years earlier had remarried, to a Latvian widower, Bruno Ozolins,
                    who was working as a tugboat captain. He was a warm, kind man, a great comfort
                    to her. But Bruno died suddenly of a heart attack in March 1966, leaving my
                    mother alone again and with very limited income. Clearly it was time for me to
                    get back to the U.S. and enter the real world. So I headed back and decided to
                    take the Foreign Service exam as soon as I could, I think it was given that
                    summer, with the intention of joining the Foreign Service if I passed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I mean, here you were sort of off in one direction,
                        the Foreign Service seemed to be, even though people might have hinted that
                        it might be a good idea, it didn't seem to have particularly crossed your
                        path in anything you were doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, it hadn't crossed my path literally, but the concept certainly had.
                    I mean, I was foreign born to begin with and by that time my foreign languages
                    included French and German. I guess at the core I had two motivations. One was
                    adventure, the other was service. And of course both are captured in the name,
                    Foreign Service. Service for me was important because, as I tried to suggest, I
                    felt very privileged by the way that the U.S. had received me. From the time I
                    arrived at the age of seven I'd been very fortunate and I'd lived in wonderful,
                    comfortable surroundings, even though we started off with no money at all, and
                    I'd gotten a great education. I thought it was time to sort of pay some of that
                    back. The other element was adventure and curiosity. I loved the idea of a
                    career that would train me to live and work in foreign countries, to speak their
                    languages and to understand them from the inside. I couldn't think of a better
                    way to spend my life than that. And if I could do that while serving the country
                    that had given me so much, then that was a perfect combination.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you took the exam in '66?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, had you met any Foreign Service types?
                        Anybody, recruiters or people you knew or anything of this nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>SILINS: No, I don't recall any contacts with someone actually in the Foreign
                    Service. Nora Lejins, the wife of a Latvian relative of mine, was I believe the
                    head of language services for the State Department, but she was a linguist and I
                    don't recall her trying to steer me toward the Foreign Service before I decided
                    on it myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, did you pass the exam in '66?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I passed the written exam and then I was given the oral exam that fall,
                    if I remember correctly. I was convinced that I'd flunked it because back in
                    those days, you may recall that the oral exam was fairly aggressive. One of the
                    things they did was to zero in on areas where they knew you were ignorant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I used to give that exam about 10 years later and it was
                        still the three people and yes, we would. We figured yes, he knows this,
                        let's go after this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, that's exactly what they did, and what they quite correctly
                    concluded was that I knew too little about economics and too little about
                    American history. And so they raked me over the coals on that for a while.
                    Outerbridge Horsey was the chairman of the panel, pretty imposing name.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. Do you recall any of the questions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: The ones I recall are the ones I didn't know the answers to. One was
                    about the Kennedy Round of tariff negotiations and whether there was a
                    difference in its benefits for small as opposed to large countries. I had no
                    idea then and no idea now what the answer is to that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, you see a stunned look on my face too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Right. No idea at all on that one. Another one I remember was not really
                    a question but a task. Trace for us if you would, Mr. Silins, the expansion of
                    the United States to the west and name the major acquisitions of territory.
                    Well, I stumbled around that a bit and didn't get much past the Louisiana
                    Purchase. And so I thought afterwards that Outerbridge was going to tell me,
                    nice try but no dice. In fact he didn't, he said that I'd passed and I was quite
                    amazed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you came into the Foreign Service when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>SILINS: Not immediately because at that time they weren't hiring for budget
                    reasons. It was then called “balance of payments problems.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: BALPA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Right. And there was also my military obligation to be settled. The
                    Vietnam War was still raging, of course. I was enlisted in the Army Reserve and
                    now that I was no longer a student, I had to do my active duty for training,
                    around six or eight months. And so that still had to be scheduled. But in any
                    case the State Department wasn't hiring at the time. At some point well after I
                    passed the orals I received a letter from State which said essentially, well,
                    we're not hiring now and we don't know when we will be hiring, but if you're
                    willing to sign on for a year to an assignment in Vietnam on loan to AID (Agency
                    for International Development), we'll bring you directly into a Foreign Service
                    position right after that. And frankly, I didn't hesitate too long. Not because
                    I was an enthusiastic supporter of our Vietnam policy but for motives parallel
                    to those that pulled me toward the Foreign Service, service and adventure. I
                    might well have volunteered to go to Vietnam as my first Foreign Service
                    assignment even without such a coercive letter - which, by the way, greatly
                    aggravated a number of prospective young officers, who did not want an
                    assignment to Vietnam. Quite understandably. They were absolutely right to
                    object. To me, though, it seemed that our government was already trying its
                    damnedest to get out of Vietnam, the war had to wind down soon, and I wanted to
                    go and learn firsthand what I could about this traumatic, historic episode in
                    American history before we withdrew.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I actually joined the State Department in 1969.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to Vietnam in '69?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: No, in '70. I spent a year in Rosslyn, mostly in the basement of
                    Arlington Towers, being trained for Vietnam, learning Vietnamese and how the
                    pacification program worked that I would be working in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's see. If you graduated in '66, what were you doing in

                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>SILINS: Aside from military training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, which took
                    up the better part of a year, I was working as an editor, a technical editor, at
                    an outfit called the Research Analysis Corporation in McLean, Virginia. They did
                    some work for the military and some for private companies, about half and half.
                    I found some of the reports interesting and educational. One I edited was a
                    comparative study of all the different kinds of internal combustion engines, the
                    Wankel engine, the reciprocating piston engine, the diesel engine, the rotary
                    engine, with a comparison of efficiencies and costs and so forth. To most people
                    it might seem painful but I kind of enjoyed it because I was learning something
                    new. Also, I was the only male editor among some interesting young women. I got
                    pretty good at editing, although it seems to have made it harder for me to do my
                    own writing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, from sort of '69-'70, you were taking Vietnamese, is
                        that it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Right. Taking Vietnamese and being trained to be a district advisor in
                    the so-called pacification program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you talk a bit about the training of people there and
                        the outlook at that point towards Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, I've called this the most painful period of my life, painful not in
                    a profound sense but in the sense that it was boring and restrictive. The way
                    that Vietnamese was taught there was boring to me because of the narrow range of
                    the vocabulary and the expressions they focused on. It was designed primarily
                    for military people - most of the men doing the job I was headed for were young
                    captains and majorr - so it had a lot of military lingo, you know, not the kind
                    of things that I was interested in saying, actually.</p>
                <p>My own views on Vietnam were very mixed at the time. I felt that we had made a
                    big mistake in getting in. At the same time I felt that in some sense we were on
                    the right side, which I still feel today, but of course not that we should have
                    killed so many people trying to support that side. I agreed to go in part
                    because by then it was already clear that we were pulling out. I mean, we'd
                    started to withdraw well before '69. So I was torn. I was willing to go because
                    it was something that my country, the U.S., was doing and I was willing to do my
                    part in it, but I didn't feel it was a good thing to have gotten into. At the
                    same time I wasn't all that impressed with the anti-war movement. So it was a
                    very uncomfortable period. A boring training program, these mixed, divided
                    feelings, mixed emotions and waiting and waiting until the training would end
                    and I could finally leave for Vietnam. It was a difficult time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you arrive in Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>SILINS: I think it was in June of 1970. I did some personal travel on my way
                    toward the Pacific in late spring, including a memorable motorcycle trip with a
                    friend around Pike's Peak in Colorado. Then, since I had another friend in L.A.
                    and was curious about the mood on college campuses, I did a “comparison visit”
                    to UCLA and Berkeley. Quite a contrast. From UCLA the dominant image I retain is
                    a placid scene of beautiful sunbathing coeds. Berkeley of course was agitated as
                    usual by demonstrations, not against the war on that day but in protest of
                    alleged exploitation of university employees. After this I linked up with a
                    small group of Vietnam-bound Foreign Service officers. We made rather
                    self-indulgent tourist stops en route in Hawaii and Japan, visiting both Tokyo
                    and Kyoto and a lot of territory between. As you might imagine, we justified all
                    this to ourselves on the argument that we might die in Vietnam. Our fun over, we
                    proceeded to Taiwan for training in tropical agriculture, Miracle Rice and a
                    little bit about the kind of light industry that might work in Vietnam. Then off
                    to Saigon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this was a relatively quiet period, I guess, wasn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Depends on where you were. It wasn't all that quiet. Just before I left
                    Washington, the night I was driving my airfreight to Andrews Air Force base, the
                    radio started broadcasting news about U.S. bombing of Cambodia. That was an
                    expansion of the military conflict and made my mother, who had lost my father in
                    another war, very nervous.</p>
                <p>Like everyone else, the first thing I remember after landing at Saigon's Tan Son
                    Nhat Airport was a blast of tropical heat and the shriek of jet engines. I have
                    fragmented memories of my first disoriented days in Saigon. Being knocked off my
                    feet, unhurt, by a car while walking along a sidewalk, the Vietnamese occupants
                    jumping out, smiling and laughing, not out of amusement but acute embarrassment
                    and apology. A Vietnamese woman invading my room in the middle of the night in a
                    fleabag hotel, just looking, it turned out, for a place to sleep until morning.
                    Another fleabag hotel where I awoke with large cockroaches nibbling on my
                    eyebrows. And so forth. Welcome to Vietnam. The fleabag hotels, by the way, were
                    not places of my own choosing but where I was assigned to stay by my employer,
                    the CORDS program.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>SILINS: Right. Our Saigon processing-in included a pep talk from the famous John
                    Paul Vann, then the golden boy of the pacification program. He was later
                    dissected in Neil Sheehan's A Bright Shining Lie. CORDS then sent us off on an
                    orientation trip to various districts and provinces in different parts of South
                    Vietnam. In one of them we came under mortar attack, a reminder, if we needed
                    one, there was still a war on. And I was issued a Colt 45, which I carried for a
                    few months. But then, I have to say luckily, I was assigned to a very peaceful
                    model district, where I replaced Ken Quinn as District Senior Advisor. And there
                    I formed at first a rather distorted view of the war and its prospects. It was
                    in Sa Dec Province in the Mekong Delta, flat as a board, between the Bassac and
                    Mekong Rivers, not more than a few meters above water level at any time, a good
                    deal of it underwater in the rainy season.</p>
                <p>The district was called Duc Thanh District. It was controlled by the Hoa Hao, a
                    Buddhist sect that was very anti-Viet Cong, so they kept most of the war at bay.
                    It was prosperous, with rich soil, rice agriculture and some other crops, animal
                    husbandry, handicrafts and light manufacturing. What I was doing there was
                    basically AID and Peace Corps-type work. I was the head of a small team
                    reporting to the province senior advisor, Bob Traister. His deputy, who wrote my
                    efficiency report, was an Army lieutenant colonel. I had a Filipino agricultural
                    advisor who was spreading the green revolution. You remember IR8, one of the new
                    rice varieties that were supposed to revolutionize the world's food supply? My
                    villagers were skeptical and didn't care all that much for the taste. And we
                    were building roads and bridges and schools and little dispensaries, medical
                    treatment centers, and so forth.</p>
                <p>Much of our travel was by boat, a Boston Whaler with a temperamental motor. I
                    also had an International Scout, the SUV of the time, which I eventually traded
                    for a real Army jeep. With my counterpart, the Vietnamese District Chief, I made
                    regular visits to the villages and hamlets to inquire into their problems, needs
                    and wishes. All too often an inescapable part of such official visits was heavy
                    drinking, usually warm brandy and soda in very large glasses, and occasionally
                    exotic foods such as seven-day-old duck eggs and field mice. We had a fairly
                    comfortable compound with a generator but showered in canal water from a rooftop
                    tank settled out with alum. I also had a small military training team consisting
                    of a lieutenant named Al Heckman, a sergeant, and about four enlisted men whose
                    job was to strengthen the local self-defense forces as part of the
                    Vietnamization policy. Except for a little nibbling around the edges of the
                    district, there was no Viet Cong activity, no war. We had neither U.S. nor
                    Vietnamese regular forces operating in our territory. That was fortunate for all
                    concerned but it encouraged an overly rosy picture of what was really happening
                    in Vietnam.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>The most violent military activity in my district, I regret to say, came when a
                    U.S. helicopter, its crew having blown an emotional fuse as a result of combat
                    trauma, flew over Duc Thanh and sprayed some villages at random with machine gun
                    fire. Luckily, they hit only houses, not people. An Army team came to
                    investigate and offer compensation. They brought along a beautiful Vietnamese
                    girl, Phuong, as an interpreter. She was wearing a flowing snow-white ao dai and
                    delicate shoes, so I carried her over the muddy stretches and narrow bamboo
                    bridges as we went from hamlet to hamlet. She was light as a cloud.</p>
                <p>Another close call with friendly fire came when Secretary of the Army Stan Resor
                    came on a visit to our model district. Luckily I was monitoring the military
                    radio as our motorcade approached the village where Resor was to meet with a
                    unit of the local forces we had been training. One of the helicopter gunships
                    escorting him reported “suspected hostiles wearing black pajamas” near the
                    meeting point and requested permission to fire on them. I broke in and stopped
                    them. The guys in black were the self-defense forces the Secretary had come to
                    see.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Vietnam from 1970 to...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: To January of '73. I left right after the signing of the so-called peace
                    agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Vietnamese government, the
                        GVN (Government of the Republic of Vietnam), in your area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: In my area, in the first year, it was favorable. I worked hand in hand
                    with the district chief, who was a Vietnamese Army major. He was a northerner, a
                    Catholic refugee from North Vietnam. He was quite effective, honest as far as I
                    could tell, pretty efficient, good-natured and seemed to be accepted by the
                    village and hamlet chiefs. He made a point of regularly spending the night in
                    the less secure border hamlets to “show the flag.” Sometimes I would accompany
                    him. I still remember a walk through one of the more iffy hamlets. My presence
                    always attracted young children, who were generally allowed to roam at will, in
                    droves. The hair on my arms fascinated them. At one end - the good end - of the
                    hamlet, the kids swarmed around me, laughing and joking. As we walked through
                    the middle, they became quieter and began to drop away. As we approached the far
                    end, nearest the district border, mothers ran out of the house to snatch their
                    children inside as we came near. It meant the VC had a presence there, and the
                    parents were afraid of letting their children appear to be friendly toward U.S.
                    or GVN officials.</p>
                <p>But aside from these little warning signs, the place was humming, the war was not
                    a problem, and it seemed not entirely lunatic to hope we could spread that happy
                    state to the rest of South Vietnam. If peace and prosperity could prevail in Duc
                    Thanh, why not elsewhere? Well, for lots of reasons, as became clearer to me
                    later.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>I did not spend my entire Vietnam assignment in the Mekong Delta. Well before my
                    first year was up, I was picked to serve as the aide to Ambassador Ellsworth
                    Bunker in Saigon... perhaps because I was the only candidate who showed up for
                    the interview in a dark suit. Ambassador Bunker was a rather formal man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes, yes - the aide, which is a very good job, but it
                        was done with a certain amount of propriety and all that. Walt Cutler was
                        one, and others had gone through that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: It was a wonderful opportunity for me. So I got to see the war from the
                    rice shoots level and also from the top.</p>
                <p>But to continue with your previous question, my impression of the Vietnamese
                    government.... When Ambassador Bunker went on one of his consultation trips to
                    the U.S. and expected to be away for some time, this was after I'd been working
                    for him for about a year, with his permission and authority I took my own little
                    research trip in Vietnam. I visited parts of the country that I hadn't seen
                    before, especially farther north, in Military Regions I and II. I talked to
                    district advisors in depth, saw what the situation was like and got their candid
                    assessments of how representatives of the Vietnamese government were performing.
                    Having been one, I knew what to ask them. I wrote a short report for the
                    ambassador concluding that our policy just wasn't going to work, that the
                    political structure we were trying to build simply would not hold together
                    unless the Vietnamese government made some basic changes. It was clear to me
                    that aside from oases of security like Duc Thanh, things were not going well at
                    all, as we now know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, there were several. Corruption, insufficient motivation. Lack of
                    trust in the Thieu regime and its representatives. Resentment of the foreign
                    military presence. A growing conviction that U.S. forces would be worn down as
                    the French had been before them. A basic problem was that Vietnamese government
                    officials were seen as, and perceived themselves as being, puppets of a foreign
                    power, which was a fatal problem in Vietnam over the long run. We could not
                    impose a solution from the outside, because the attempt to do that, for people
                    as intensely patriotic, really, and xenophobic to some extent, as the Vietnamese
                    are, would cause the government agents that worked for us to be seen as puppets
                    of a foreign power. That was a fatal flaw, such a program could not win lasting
                    popular support.</p>
                <p>As I recall, my report sat on Ambassador Bunker's desk for the space of a week or
                    so, then he returned it to me. I don't recall that he made any comment on it. It
                    was not, of course, the only negative assessment of U.S. prospects in Vietnam
                    that he read, as I know very well since I selected much of his daily reading and
                    put the papers on his desk every day.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Ambassador Bunker?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: He had the most impressive presence of any diplomat that I have worked
                    with. Of course, he was the first one of world class that I worked with closely
                    when I was still in my impressionable youth, but he was exceptional. He had
                    great power of recall. He could recognize Marines that had served for him when
                    he was ambassador to India when they came through Vietnam and wound up on his
                    security guard. So, a superb memory. When I started working for him he was
                    already 75, 76, something like that, but with plenty of energy. He worked
                    six-and-a-half days a week without fail, long hours.</p>
                <p>The most impressive thing about Bunker was something that to this day I can't
                    really explain, and that was an ability to get people to do things without
                    overtly asking or telling them what he wanted them to do. That is the true
                    genius of leadership, when you can get people to imagine for themselves what it
                    is you want them to do and do it accurately... that's just something
                    extraordinary, I don't know how he did that. He did it with me as his aide, but
                    he could also do it with the very senior Americans that formed the Mission
                    Council. I saw him in action because I had the privilege of sitting in on
                    Mission Council meetings for almost two years, but to this day I am not sure how
                    he was able to lead in that indirect way.</p>
                <p>Perhaps I should mention here the “honeymoon flights.” These were the shuttle
                    flights between Saigon and Katmandu that were a unique feature of Bunker's
                    tenure in Saigon. They came about because Bunker's second wife, Carol Laise, was
                    the U.S. ambassador to Nepal. They married in Katmandu in early 1967. President
                    Johnson, when he pressured Bunker into taking on the Vietnam job not long after
                    the wedding, promised that a government plane would be provided for regular,
                    shall we say, conjugal visits. The flights continued into the Nixon
                    administration. So every few months Bunker would fly to Nepal or Carol Laise
                    would come to Saigon. There were always quite a lot of extra seats, so members
                    of both U.S. missions alternated on R &amp; R trips. I went on one of the longer
                    ones, with the additional duty of escorting Bunker's lithe and spirited
                    granddaughter from Brazil. I almost got her killed. I think her name was
                    Patsy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>SILINS: I was staying with the Peace Corps doctor in Katmandu, who organized a
                    motorcycle outing. We were coming back from the Tibet border, with the young
                    lady riding on the back of my bike. The road, like almost all roads in Nepal, as
                    you can imagine, was narrow with a vertical wall on one side and a steep drop on
                    the other. A water buffalo was moving along the road ahead of us, placidly
                    trudging along in the same direction as us, hugging the safe side. As we were
                    about to pass, suddenly it lurched into the middle of the road, almost knocking
                    us over the edge. I guess it was startled by the motorcycle's engine noise. With
                    miraculous luck neither of us suffered more than minor scrapes.</p>
                <p>I still remember those ten days or so in Nepal very vividly. It's sad to think
                    how much Nepal must have changed by now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's turn back to Vietnam. What was your impression
                        of, say, the Mission Council? There's often a split between the junior
                        officers who are out in the field and are inclined to take a more cynical
                        view of things, maybe more accurate, and the senior officers who have been
                        around, seen it all and take imperfections without being too upset by them
                        and see a different world. I mean, did you see that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Oh sure. There were sharp divisions, there were chasms between groups of
                    people in the U.S. mission in Vietnam. But these differences were not debated at
                    Mission Council meetings, which is where the topmost officials - the Ambassador
                    and Deputy Ambassador, the CIA station chief, the commander of U.S. forces, the
                    head of USIA, the head of the pacification program, and so forth - met, mostly
                    to consecrate policy lines that had already been agreed upon. There were also
                    lower-level country team meetings within the embassy that I did not attend, so I
                    can't say to what extent differing views were expressed there. I know that many
                    political officers thought our cause was doomed and were trying to report that,
                    but were totally ignored, really. Even the minister-counselor for political
                    affairs, as far as I could tell, had no direct impact on policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Bill Hitchcock. Below him there was, as I recall, another political
                    counselor, Lauren Askew. There was skepticism about our policy among the CIA
                    personnel, but I never heard the station chief, Ted Shackley and then Tom
                    Polgar, express that at the Mission Council meetings. But then, I wouldn't
                    expect them to. That was not what those meetings were for.</p>
                <p>U.S. policy was run out of the White House, that was clear to me from the start.
                    Some policy messages were ultra-sensitive. I was not allowed to see the
                    back-channel communications that passed between Kissinger and Bunker and Nixon
                    and Bunker. Those messages came in CIA channels, usually delivered personally by
                    Ted Shackley. That's how policy was conveyed.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the atmosphere between the political section and
                        the ambassador's office? Did they seem to be on a different course than,
                        say, the CIA or the military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I'm not sure I should make sweeping characterizations here. I think most
                    of the political section felt that the situation was not sustainable and they
                    also felt that their views were not being adequately taken into account in the
                    formulation of policy. And they kept trying to get these views to the
                    ambassador, including through me, of course. The ambassador would occasionally
                    see them, but it didn't change U.S. policy at all, in fact, it couldn't have
                    because the person they had to get to, of course, was Nixon or Kissinger, not
                    Bunker. Bunker was not going to send a cable to Nixon saying, “You know, Mr.
                    President, my political section has just persuaded me that we are on a fool's
                    errand here. Let's change course!” Anyway, it's clearer to me now than it was
                    then that Bunker himself was a convinced hawk on Vietnam and was pretty much
                    beyond persuasion.</p>
                <p>As to what the views of the CIA were, I think they were trying to do the job they
                    were being asked to do. My impression was they were less inclined openly to
                    challenge established policy. A well-known exception to that, somebody I had
                    regular contact with, was Frank Snepp, a CIA strategy analyst in Saigon who
                    interrogated prisoners and debriefed agents. He saw disaster looming and, after
                    Saigon finally collapsed, wrote a gripping, controversial book, Decent Interval,
                    which earned him a great deal of grief from the Agency for allegedly violating
                    his secrecy oath. So there were people with widely different views, but often
                    they kept them to themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you traveled around, did there seem to be an embassy
                        point of view of the situation and a field point of view and were there
                        differences there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, the general feeling was, I think this is accurate, that the Saigon
                    establishment was trying to impose an optimistic view on everybody else and was
                    fiddling with the various complicated, sophisticated programs of analysis that
                    we had, like the HES, the Hamlet Evaluation System, was trying to jiggle them to
                    produce a positive trend line. People out in the field felt under pressure to
                    show constant and steady progress. I think that's true, there was that pressure
                    and of course things fell apart in the end partly because the picture we were
                    relying on was not entirely accurate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your feeling about the Foreign Service? This is
                        your first post there and how things were done and all and you're really at
                        the center of the major focus of American foreign policy at this time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>SILINS: Well, I knew it wasn't a typical Foreign Service post. As I say, it was
                    clear to me from the start that U.S. policy was not coming out of the State
                    Department, the State Department had little decisive effect on our Vietnam
                    policy except for providing some very talented people to carry it out. The
                    policy was being run from the White House and the NSC (National Security
                    Council). I preferred to believe and hope that Embassy Saigon was not a model of
                    what I had to look forward to in my future Foreign Service career.</p>
                <p>Perhaps I should mention that at the time, the group of people that most
                    impressed me in Vietnam was not the Foreign Service, was not AID, it wasn't CIA
                    - it was the young and mid-grade military officers who volunteered to be
                    advisors in the pacification program. I met a lot of those guys because, first
                    of all, I had that job myself and secondly, I took that tour when the ambassador
                    was away and met a lot more of them up north. These captains and majors were
                    smart, they were dedicated, they were brave; they took a lot of chances and they
                    did it for little payback. It was not a career-enhancing move for them, they
                    were not getting promoted for being advisors. Promotions came faster to officers
                    with combat and command experience. They knew that, but they still did a good
                    job, almost all of them. My hat's off to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you, from your position sitting at the desk outside of
                        the ambassador's office, have any feel about how the embassy operated with
                        the two governments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Oh yes. I was the guy who would call the Presidential Palace when
                    Ambassador Bunker wanted to see President Thieu. My contact was Thieu's aide,
                    Hoang Duc Nha. We tried to be polite but to exert pressure where we could. Of
                    course we were sometimes deeply involved in trying to steer political affairs in
                    that country.</p>
                <p>An episode that sticks in my mind relates to Vietnam's presidential election of
                    1971. Ambassador Bunker had returned to the embassy from a meeting with an
                    opposition leader, General Duong Van Minh, usually called Big Minh. Minh had
                    briefly been president himself after the overthrow of Diem in 1963, and he was
                    the sole remaining candidate who might run against Thieu. We were urging him to
                    stay in the race so there would be a contested democratic election for the
                    presidency. Minh, being no fool, saw he was sure to lose and didn't want to run.
                    He thought the deck was stacked against him. Bunker went to see him. When he
                    returned to the embassy, he dictated a memorandum of conversation, a memcon, to
                    his secretary Eva Kim - who, by the way, is the best secretary I've worked with
                    in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes, she has a great reputation.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>SILINS: Eva typed it up and took the memcon in to the ambassador's office. The
                    ambassador then did something unusual. He called me in and handed it to me to
                    read over. He said he wanted to know “if it was hanging together properly.” He
                    had never done anything of the sort before.</p>
                <p>I read it over. It was not long. Bunker had summarized two conversations, a
                    plenary meeting with Minh and several other participants, and a private
                    one-on-one meeting between the ambassador and Big Minh. According to the memcon,
                    though, Bunker had just repeated to Big Minh privately more or less verbatim the
                    arguments for why Minh should stay in the race that he had already used in the
                    plenary meeting. Puzzled, I went back in to the ambassador and pointed this out.
                    I said it didn't ring true, there was something odd about this. Why would he
                    just repeat himself? Bunker seemed a bit flustered and took the memcon back. I'm
                    not sure what happened to it afterwards but I now know, as I did not at the
                    time, what was going on. This was the meeting in which Bunker offered Minh money
                    to stay in the election. I guess Bunker was using me as a litmus test to see if
                    his sanitized report would pass muster.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling about how well the economic stability
                        of Vietnam was going, the economic side during this time you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, a lot better than it was subsequently after the collapse. It
                    depended very much on the region. Where I worked to begin with, the Mekong
                    Delta, was quite prosperous, really. But then I visited deeply depressed areas
                    and of course war-torn areas where people were very badly off. Saigon itself was
                    thriving but that was because a lot of foreign money was coming in. So in
                    general, I mean, the economy was not the problem. We didn't lose Vietnam because
                    of economic collapse, that wasn't the decisive issue.</p>
                <p>By the way, it still amazes me in retrospect what freedom of movement Americans
                    enjoyed in much of Vietnam during the war. When assigned to Sa Dec Province, I
                    traveled often to Saigon and back, usually unarmed and unaccompanied, and of
                    course all around Duc Thanh District and elsewhere in the province - sometimes
                    even by Vespa. When working at the Embassy, I made lots of trips inside and
                    outside Saigon in my Embassy Toyota and almost never felt I was in danger. There
                    were of course terrorist acts. When the Long Binh ammo dump was blown up, the
                    shock wave knocked in my window air conditioner and damaged a number of windows
                    at the Embassy. Explosions continued all day. A bar occasionally got blown up,
                    and so forth. But a lot of Vietnam was safe for travel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the relationship during the '70-'73 period,
                        particularly during your time between Bunker and the media, American media
                        in particular?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>SILINS: Yes. I used to talk to the media, newspaper and wire service reporters
                    mostly, quite a lot. I can't say that I told them much they didn't know. I took
                    almost too seriously my responsibility not to leak anything from the
                    ambassador's office. But I liked them because I'd been in a humble way one of
                    them way back when I worked for the Washington Star. They were interesting
                    folks, they're smart and they know what's going on. So I would see reporters
                    like Fox Butterfield of The New York Times or George McArthur of the AP often,
                    but I probably wasn't much professional help to them, I'm afraid. Bunker met
                    regularly with the press, including informal get-togethers, but neither side
                    made much of a dent in the other. Bunker was restrained in expressing negative
                    opinions of the press but I believe now, judging by statements in his own oral
                    history interview, that he regarded a free uncensored press as a serious,
                    potentially fatal, impediment to a democratic society's successful prosecution
                    of a war.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what was your feeling about what AID was doing at this
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, I'd worked for AID for about nine months and I think some of what
                    they were doing was fine, but it was predicated on a false premise. The premise
                    was that we could make a go of it with the current government of South Vietnam.
                    And so in that sense many of us felt that it was basically money down the drain.
                    Not because the programs were always badly designed, but because the whole
                    enterprise was going to fail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the congressmen coming in, were you getting much from
                        the Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes, there were quite a few visits. Two Congressional staffers in
                    particular were active at the time. Moose and Lowenstein, staffers for the
                    Senate Foreign Relations Committee, were the dynamic duo, if I remember
                    correctly. They took a dim view of our Southeast Asia policy and came through a
                    number of times, looking for evidence that our policy was not working. I
                    remember playing tennis with them. Congress was restive and trying to find out
                    what was going on, but I don't recall that they had a big impact on policy out
                    in the field. Of course, they did back in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feeling that the embassy felt
                        beleaguered, not by troops, but I mean defending a policy, and it was a
                        policy that was beginning to have problems defending itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>SILINS: Oh yes. I mean, that's how I saw it even before I got there. It clearly
                    was a beleaguered operation. Of course the embassy had also been physically
                    attacked, assaulted in a very dramatic way, during Tet of '68. But yes, also in
                    the political sense many, perhaps most of us felt that we were defending a ....
                    I thought it was a doomed project and that's in fact why I left. When my
                    assignment formally expired for the second time, Ambassador Bunker asked me to
                    stay on. Obviously, he didn't want to have to break in yet another aide. He
                    himself had been there since early 1967 and I know he looked dimly on short
                    tours. But I had been there for two-and-a-half years, had already extended my
                    tour once, I thought the peace agreement was not going to solve the problem,
                    especially since it left the North Vietnamese forces in place, and I really
                    didn't want to be there when it all collapsed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the '73 peace agreements came in and you left.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: That's right. I left even though officers who had served in Vietnam were
                    being recruited to come back to “monitor the peace.” I don't regret that
                    decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How does your Vietnam experience look to you now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Vietnam is still the assignment I recall most vividly, I guess because I
                    was young, green and exposed to such a range of powerful impressions. What I
                    learned from it is harder to sum up. Part of the trouble is that I had so little
                    direct experience of the grim and bloody side of the war, so what dominates is
                    my memory of that heightened sense of awareness you get in a war zone, a feeling
                    of being more alert and alive. But intellectually I learned to be very wary of
                    the notion that war is just an extension of foreign policy by other means. It's
                    not. It's a miserable business that should be avoided if at all possible. Almost
                    always it does more harm than good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where'd you go next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I went to Romania because I was persuaded it would be an interesting
                    place to work by Harry Barnes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had just been ambassador there, or became....</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>SILINS: He had been DCM (Deputy Chief of Mission) there. Harry Barnes was now in
                    personnel and in that capacity he was coming through Vietnam to talk to FSOs and
                    make sure that they were going to be okay career-wise. I had wanted to go to
                    Western Europe. He persuaded me that Eastern Europe was where it was happening.
                    And so I put in a bid for a job in Bucharest, and after studying Romanian went
                    off, well, after a brief bout of hepatitis, went off as an economic-commercial
                    officer in Bucharest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Bucharest from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: '73 to '75, which was a fascinating time to be in Bucharest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd seen Saigon, could you describe Romania as you saw
                        it when you arrived in Bucharest in '73?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Romania was pretty rundown economically but was to me a geographically
                    and architecturally interesting place. Romania is a country of a schizophrenic
                    nature, it has a split personality. One of the ways that manifests itself is
                    that in the summertime Bucharest looks like Paris, but in the winter it looks
                    more like Moscow or someplace communist and rundown. The country is beautiful,
                    it has the Black Sea coast and the Danube Delta, it has mountains, it has very
                    fertile farmland and lots of interesting old architecture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the regime of Ceausescu seen at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: At that time Ceausescu was the darling of the West because he had managed
                    to tweak Moscow's nose a few times, he had good relations with China and he was
                    the only East European leader who had diplomatic relations with Israel. He was
                    also experimenting with a few economic reforms like joint ventures just to keep
                    us interested. And so most Western countries thought he was the cat's pajamas
                    and they sent very good diplomats there, which was one of the hidden benefits of
                    serving in Bucharest, your foreign colleagues were very bright.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: So from that point of view it was quite the place to be. Being, of
                    course, the lowly econ-commercial officer I was not exactly in the thick of
                    things, although the ambassador, who was eventually Harry Barnes...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But who was the ambassador to begin with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>SILINS: Well, Bob Martens. That is, Bob Martens had been charg� for an extended
                    period, something like six to nine months, and then eventually Harry Barnes, who
                    had earlier been DCM, was named ambassador. He was ambassador for most of my
                    time in Bucharest. Dick Viets arrived soon after Harry as his DCM.</p>
                <p>But as I was saying, Harry being a generous man with his junior officers,
                    involved us in as many things as he could. He would take me along frequently,
                    even though I was not a political officer, to meetings to act as notetaker. He
                    even called on me occasionally to interpret because my Romanian was pretty good.
                    Of course, his was even better. And I got involved, in a marginal way, in the
                    negotiation of the trade agreement that we signed with Romania in '75. So I got
                    to see a fair amount and I was really quite excited by all this and wanted to
                    come back to Romania when I left, I thought it was fascinating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you know, it wasn't until '89 that it all fell
                        apart, but Ceausescu's regime really became nasty. Was this early on, and
                        was it seen as being, well, as difficult for people to live there as it was
                        later on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: It was always recognized that Ceausescu if given his druthers would
                    internally be a little Stalin, a little tyrant, and he was. He had a restrictive
                    internal regime, although to foreign diplomats it seemed in some respects,
                    compared to countries like the USSR, to be not that bad. For example, the travel
                    regime in Romania was much more flexible than in the Soviet Union, it was much
                    easier to get around and even to visit factories and places like that in
                    Romania. So that gave it the appearance of being relatively liberal. Whereas of
                    course it wasn't at all liberal with the restrictions it imposed on its own
                    citizens, who were compelled to report on contacts with foreigners and all the
                    rest of it. At the time what we did as a mission was to say, well, that's
                    unfortunate and, you know, it's something we really ought to try to do something
                    about ... or maybe Ceausescu really ought to do something about it. But more
                    important to us was Romania's foreign policy, because we were still playing
                    basically balance of power politics, and Ceausescu was a pawn to be used in the
                    bigger game, which involved the Soviet Union and China and the other Central
                    European countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>I subsequently came to believe, and this is based on a lot of thought because I
                    was also eventually desk officer for Romania for two years in Washington, that
                    we had made a misjudgment. We had not given enough importance to the man's
                    internal policies and we had exaggerated the importance of his foreign policies.
                    And we'd made even more basic misjudgments. For example, we thought that if we
                    encouraged Ceausescu in his foreign-policy independence from the Soviet Union,
                    that would encourage other East European leaders to follow the same path. What
                    we didn't realize was that Ceausescu was universally loathed, despised, held in
                    contempt by virtually all of his peers, in part because of the dictatorial way
                    that he ran his country, which went beyond what the others did. I mean, most of
                    those countries were internally pretty tough but what they saw in Ceausescu was
                    a man who was really Stalin-like in that he enjoyed it, you know, he really did
                    it out of spite and got kind of a sadistic pleasure out of hurting his people.
                    That is what inspired their contempt, and therefore there's no way he could have
                    been a model. And so the excessive attention we lavished on Ceausescu hurt us
                    with other countries. They thought, well, how good is our judgment if we can't
                    see what the guy is really all about?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this was really a product of Kissinger and Nixon,
                        wasn't it? I mean, the grand game appealed to both of them as being...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes, right, yes. Kissinger and Nixon were both very Realpolitik kind of
                    guys. But eventually even Kissinger, if you read his book Diplomacy, which is,
                    by the way, a very good book... he concluded that for the United States,
                    straight real Realpolitik, no chaser, is not a possible policy, it'll never be
                    accepted by the American people. The American people insist that there be some
                    human rights or moral element, some more idealistic input, into their foreign
                    policy. I think that's absolutely right and I also feel the same way myself. I
                    guess the difference is that Kissinger views the intrusion of this moral element
                    with regret while I believe it is a good thing. But in any case that wasn't our
                    policy at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there at the time any division within the embassy as
                        far as Realpolitik? Did people, say, from the consular section or elsewhere
                        complain ...but you know these guys, you've got this, what are they called,
                        the security...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: The “Securitate.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Securitate is really beating up on people and I mean,
                        it's really nasty. Were you getting this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>SILINS: No. There were no divisions in the embassy because everybody saw the same
                    things, agreed it was happening, but had decided it wasn't our main issue. It's
                    not that Harry Barnes said, you know, let's ignore human rights and just focus
                    on Realpolitik. We had some contacts with dissidents and so forth. But first of
                    all, this was before the real human rights crusade hit U.S. foreign policy. We
                    had some interest in it, in fact, but it was limited more to emigration issues
                    than anything else. That was the real focus of U.S. human rights policy in
                    Romania. It became an intense focus at the end of my tour when, during a visit
                    by President Ford in August 1975, we signed a trade agreement with Romania. It
                    incorporated the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which linked most favored nation trade
                    status to freedom of emigration. Romania I believe was the first country to sign
                    a trade agreement with us with that condition. And so they fell subject to an
                    intensive scrutiny of their emigration policy and that took some of the heat off
                    other human rights issues for a while.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a time when Romania was acting as a conduit for
                        Jews coming out not just from Romania but also the Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I'm not sure if they served as a conduit. They did allow Jews to leave
                    Romania, but they allowed them to leave for a price. In other words, Israel was
                    buying them out, something which I didn't know at the time but which I learned
                    subsequently. Romania was really fiendishly clever in the way that it reacted to
                    the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. As I recall, at least in the beginning they
                    pretended to ignore that the real thrust behind Jackson-Vanik was an interest in
                    Jewish emigration, and they caused Jewish emigration actually to decline after
                    the signing of the agreement, as if to show that, you know, they're not going to
                    be coerced by us to up the rate. However, non-Jewish emigration was allowed to
                    go up so as to keep Romania in compliance with the letter of the amendment. But
                    of course that wasn't the point, so it was kind of a practical joke they were
                    playing on us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As an economic-commercial officer, what were you
                        doing?</hi>

                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>SILINS: I was doing a lot of traveling around and reporting. I was going to as
                    many factories as I could and reporting on general economic conditions,
                    analyzing their stupid five year plans. But also a lot of business facilitation
                    because we had big U.S. companies doing business with Romania. By big I mean
                    Boeing, for example, and McDonnell Douglas. Boeing was successfully selling
                    aircraft, McDonnell Douglas was trying to. A big bank had set up a branch there,
                    Manufacturers Hanover Trust. We had a computer manufacturer, Control Data
                    Corporation, that was going into a joint venture. Plus a lot of smaller
                    operations, and so I was pretty busy with American businessmen, most of whom had
                    a very hard time in their negotiations with the Romanians. Romanians were
                    fiendish negotiators, would often put two competitors side-by-side and go from
                    one to the other, back and forth, squeezing each one for the last penny that
                    they could on a contract. And since often the Romanian partner didn't perform on
                    their side of contracts, I had trade complaints to attend to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was morale like at the post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Good. Excellent. It was fine because, as I say, at that time Romania was
                    considered to be very special and we had impressive colleagues from other
                    embassies to work with. Our living conditions were exceptionally good. There was
                    even a club, a diplomatic club there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The famous nine-hole golf course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: That's the one. And with a swimming pool, tennis courts. It was just
                    unbeatable for a Warsaw Pact post. It promoted an active, almost sybaritic
                    social life among the foreign community, which in turn fed the illusion that all
                    was well in Romania. The sordid reality underneath became clear to me only much,
                    much later. One source was a book published in 1987 by a defector, Ion Pacepa,
                    who had been a top Romanian intelligence official. It's called Red Horizons and
                    is unbelievably sordid but, sad to say, presumably accurate. I didn't have the
                    stomach to finish it. The book is in a class by itself. Pacepa's report that
                    Romania's so-called maverick foreign policy was actually a complex scam that
                    Ceausescu hatched in 1972 is actually one of his less troubling revelations, at
                    least on the nastiness scale.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling about the Soviet menace, threat or
                        whatever it was during that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>SILINS: Well, I got a pretty good view of that because, as I mentioned, Harry
                    Barnes was a generous ambassador. He actually agreed - in fact it may even have
                    been his idea, I don't remember ... I was in any case allowed to go on a
                    boondoggle, a trip to, let's see, to Budapest, Warsaw, and Moscow, an
                    orientation trip, to allow me to see what the Soviet threat was like and what
                    shape the communist menace took in those locations. So I saw it up close and
                    personal, and not just from Romania. I had talks in those embassies with my
                    colleagues, who wondered what the hell I was doing while they had to work, why
                    was I able to travel like this? And also with local officials and others. To
                    this day I don't quite understand why I was permitted to do it. But it was
                    educational, it really was, and that knowledge did come in handy because I
                    served in the Soviet Union and the Soviet Desk subsequently, and so I think it
                    did some good.</p>
                <p>The Soviet menace was certainly a principal preoccupation. That was one of the
                    ways in which we excused Ceausescu's conduct, that is, his internal
                    restrictions, because he had thumbed his nose at Moscow when they invaded
                    Czechoslovakia. He refused to take part in that and so the argument was, well,
                    you know, he has to be this tight internally because of course we know that the
                    USSR is working within Romania to try to unseat him, so in part it excuses what
                    he's doing. Everything during this period was seen through the prism of the Cold
                    War confrontation, the East-West confrontation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern at that time that the Soviets might try
                        to move into Romania?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I don't recall any imminent threat of that type because, you remember,
                    '75 was actually a climax of d�tente. I left Romania just days after a visit by
                    President Ford, who came to Bucharest from Helsinki where he had signed the
                    Helsinki Final Act, along with all the other European leaders. And so it was
                    really a time of relatively good East-West feeling.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>In a way I benefited from that myself. At the end of my assignment in Romania, I
                    wanted to go back to Latvia for my first visit since I left as a two-year-old.
                    To get there, I had to fly through Leningrad. I tried making arrangements
                    through Intourist in Bucharest. But this was not a normal sort of trip that the
                    Intourist office there was set up to handle, and so I wound up dealing with,
                    surprise, a KGB officer at the Soviet embassy. I had a visa and got hotel
                    reservations and plane tickets. It looked like all was well. Then at the last
                    minute, I think the day before my departure, my KGB contact called to say, very
                    sorry; nothing personal, just learned there is no hotel room available for you
                    in Riga. “Intourist in Moscow requests that you not go at this time,” he told
                    me. I found that very bizarre. I thought it over, must have talked it over with
                    Harry or Dick Viets, and decided to go anyway. I thought, what the hell, I've
                    got the visa, tickets and proof of reservations, I'll just show up at the
                    airport and see what happens. And all went well. Maybe that was because my
                    flight landed in Leningrad almost simultaneously with the biggest U.S.
                    congressional delegation ever to visit the Soviet Union, headed by Speaker of
                    the House Carl Albert. It was another celebration of the Spirit of Helsinki. I
                    guess the Soviets decided this was not the time to spoil the mood by refusing to
                    let me go to my birthplace ... although they did give it another college try.
                    When I went in to my hotel in Leningrad, where I had to overnight, I tried to
                    confirm my hotel reservation for Riga with Intourist. They stuck to the party
                    line: sorry, no hotel room available just now. And so again I just went to the
                    airport the next morning, got onto a flight to Riga and everything went fine
                    after that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you find going back to Riga?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: It was a troubling and kind of a sad experience. For one thing it's of
                    course classic that any place you go back to seems smaller than you
                    expected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: The airport seemed tiny... well, it was tiny then - and the city seemed
                    smaller than I expected. It was pretty sad and run down. But in some ways it
                    was, you know, holding together, I mean, materially. Having been an economic
                    officer I was used to looking for signs of material wellbeing, and so I went to
                    the market in Riga. Riga has a famous market, it's five former zeppelin hangars
                    which at that time, this is now August 1975, were absolutely packed with food of
                    all kinds, fresh produce, meat, fish, cheese and all kinds of things. A better
                    selection by far than I had seen in Bucharest. And so from that point of view it
                    seemed to be doing relatively okay. But signs of tension were inescapable. The
                    atmosphere of the place, the hesitation of people to speak Latvian, the
                    hesitation to meet with foreigners, it was under a much more brutal pressure
                    than Bucharest had been. So you know, it was kind of a traumatic experience for
                    me, really.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find any family there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes, in fact the main reason I went to Riga was to see my grandmother, my
                    mother's mother, before she died. And I saw her, she was in her 80s and was
                    still in pretty good shape, actually. And also saw my mother's sister, who was
                    also in relatively good shape. They shared a classic Soviet style apartment on
                    the outskirts of Riga. It was clear that the place was a police state run by
                    terror and everyone was very afraid of the consequences of talking openly to
                    anyone from the West, particularly an American diplomat. And it was also quite
                    overrun by Russians. Again, this was August. I did go to the seaside. My
                    movements were restricted, there were not many places I could go but I did go to
                    a stretch of the Baltic coast, Jurmala it's called, which means seaside. And
                    found that it was very popular with Russian tourists, just absolutely packed
                    like Coney Island. I guess because of pollution some very smelly seaweed had
                    washed up all along the beach, which gave it a kind of unpleasant
                    aftertaste.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you know, going back to Romania, I heard that at some
                        point Ceausescu was sort of selling off, this was a very fertile country,
                        was selling off produce to get money and so there were real shortages within
                        Romania. At your point of time, was this happening or was Romania basically
                        a prosperous agricultural country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: No, it wasn't. It could have been a very prosperous, had been a
                    prosperous agricultural country, but because of the stupidity, really the
                    insanity of Ceausescu's economic policies, it was running its agriculture into
                    the ground by improper management and also by excessive export, as you suggest,
                    in order to gain hard currency. More remarkable, it was even turning a major
                    resource, their oil, into a liability. Because what this man was doing right
                    before our eyes was excessively developing Romania's refining capacity to the
                    point where it exceeded the country's production capacity. This meant that in
                    order to keep its refineries busy, Romania had to become a net importer of oil,
                    like everybody else, and was therefore also negatively affected by the surge in
                    oil prices, which was absolutely crazy. It meant that what had been a major
                    asset for them was now a liability.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any influence from Yugoslavia, which had a
                        different form of economic development?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: There was some cooperation with Yugoslavia. As I recall there were two
                    types of economic cooperation. One was the Iron Gates Project, which is a dam on
                    the Danube. And they also had an ill-fated and I think eventually totally
                    unsuccessful joint project to build an aircraft. I don't know of any way in
                    which the Yugoslav worker-management model got reflected in Romania. Romania was
                    deeply committed to central management and had no use for what the Yugoslavs
                    were doing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, you left Romania in '75?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes, August '75, by way of that trip to Latvia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Back to Washington to the State Department's executive secretariat.
                    Interesting place to be at that time. I was a line officer. You know what they
                    do, quality control of documents going to the principal officers on the seventh
                    floor. But the most interesting part was travel by the Secretary of State, who
                    was Henry Kissinger at that time. And so I did a number of trips with Kissinger
                    and also one presidential trip, President Ford's visit to the Philippines, which
                    was quite a clambake, I can tell you. But it was fascinating because we did have
                    some opportunities to get up close to the secretary and see how he operated,
                    which gave me some sobering insights into his leadership style.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's see. You were with the executive secretariat from
                        '75 to...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: For just one year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '76.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: '75-'76. Then I was offered a job, which I probably should have taken, as
                    aide to the deputy secretary of state - I guess that would have been Chuck
                    Robinson. For reasons best known to myself I decided, okay, enough staff work,
                    it's time to really see how the department works up close, I want to be a desk
                    officer. That may have been a mistake. And because I still was intrigued with
                    Romania, I got the job of desk officer for Romania. That compounded the
                    mistake.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to the time you were in the executive
                        secretariat. Can you talk about your impression and impact of the Kissinger
                        style and all while you were in the building and also on the trip?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes, I think I could summarize it. His impact on the department was
                    negative personally but positive professionally. That is, people who worked
                    close to him tended to wind up being sometimes hurt by him because he was not
                    terribly kindly toward his staff. I have an anecdote, if you want, to illustrate
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: But at the same time morale was good because everybody knew that this man
                    was making U.S. foreign policy and the Department was very important in that
                    process, and that's always a good feeling. So it was a bit contradictory. It was
                    a love-hate kind of relationship, and I still feel that way about him. I have
                    tremendous respect for Kissinger as a politician, as a thinker. As a writer I
                    think he's brilliant. But as a human being he left something to be desired.</p>
                <p>The anecdote that sticks in my mind has to do with Al Adams. I knew Al Adams from
                    Vietnam. He got a job at the time I was in the secretariat as the number one
                    aide to Kissinger; that is, the junior number one aide, the one who sat outside
                    his office and came in with his papers and kept track of his appointments and so
                    forth. In other words, saw him 50 times a day. After Al had been working for him
                    for about three months, they went up to New York to attend the fall opening of
                    the UN General Assembly and stayed as usual at the Waldorf-Astoria. They spent
                    about a week up there and then, after the secretary's participation was over,
                    packed up and made their way down to the limousine with Al right behind the
                    secretary carrying his briefcase. When they got to the limousine, Kissinger
                    turned around, looked at Al slightly vaguely and said, sticking out his hand,
                    “Thank you very much, you run a great hotel.”</p>
                <p>And I also saw Kissinger on the plane sort of kicking people out of the way who
                    were working on the floor, the only available space, putting together briefing
                    books for the next stop. He had a very big ego but he left his mark on U.S.
                    foreign policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Ford trip to the
                        Philippines?</hi>

                <p>SILINS: A big circus. I don't have any great insights into it because the
                    Philippines is not my turf and my responsibility there focused only on a narrow
                    aspect - is the schedule going to work for the secretary of state? I can't tell
                    you what it meant in foreign policy terms, but it was an impressive show. I did
                    go out to meet the plane when the president and the whole party arrived and I
                    drove back in with them in the motorcade. The Filipinos had lined every foot of
                    road all the way from the airport to the Malaca�ang Palace with dancers and
                    singers and people waving; there was not an empty space along that entire route,
                    to show how well that population was organized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for when you were in the executive
                        secretariat about the role of the White House and the secretary of state,
                        the relationship between them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>SILINS: I began to get a feel for that. I'm not sure I can tell you now what I
                    thought then because I've thought about it a lot since that time, including most
                    recently when I was doing some teaching at the University of Chicago. I thought
                    at the time, and I still believe mostly, that there is an undefined aspect to
                    this relationship, there's always bound to be tension, and it usually is
                    resolved in favor of the NSC, which is closer to the White House, and not the
                    State Department. Physical proximity is a powerful trump card. Not the only one,
                    of course. When I was working in the secretariat during the Kissinger era, there
                    was less of a problem than usual, but that's because foreign policy was Henry
                    Kissinger and Henry Kissinger was foreign policy. The two were identical so
                    there really was not much of an opening for the NSC to get in the way. Usually
                    that's not the case, you don't usually have as strong a secretary of state and
                    there usually is a problem. I think there was a problem, for example, with
                    Warren Christopher, not because he was facing a particularly dynamic national
                    security advisor but because he himself wasn't sufficiently dynamic. Maybe this
                    is something we can talk about at greater length later. At the time there wasn't
                    a problem because Kissinger was...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was doing it all, you had such an interim president,
                        too. Well, you went to the Romanian desk, you were there from '76 until
                        ...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Let's see. It would have been '76-'78.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is your first sort of non-staff job in the State
                        Department. How did you find being a desk officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I found it not what I had expected, in part because of very specific
                    things happening with respect to Romania at that time. The emigration issue had
                    begun to snowball and was generating endless amounts of congressional
                    correspondence and dozens of daily phone calls that I was expected to deal with.
                    I'm just not very good at that sort of thing, just ginning out, you know, dozens
                    of pro forma responses. Some days I got close to a hundred phone calls about
                    individual cases. I got backed up on that.</p>
                <p>More seriously, what happened is that I was becoming more disillusioned about
                    U.S. policy toward Romania. I had begun to move toward the conviction I now hold
                    that we grossly exaggerated the importance of Ceausescu's foreign policy
                    credentials and had not given enough importance to his really restrictive
                    internal policies. That was becoming more clear to me, and I thought that we
                    were now really overdoing things. During my period on the desk Ceausescu was
                    invited to visit the U.S. Ceausescu was a horrible visitor. He's very demanding.
                    His people, you know, spent lots of money and they were a giant pain in the ass.
                    This is well documented by every place that he's ever been.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, in any case his people were terrible. But it was not just the
                    demands that they made in a material sense. For example, we ginned up for his
                    wife Elena, who is if anything an even worse human being than her husband ...
                    she had floated a request to be made an honorary member of the Academy of
                    Sciences because she allegedly had a degree in chemistry, which I think was
                    shown not actually to exist. But we, as did a number of other countries to their
                    eternal shame, I must say, actually tendered this honor to her. And it was
                    things like this that began to get on my nerves, being part of that kind of
                    sleazy operation, because it was now not only very clear that Ceausescu was
                    excessive in his internal restrictions, but it was also becoming plausible that
                    the man was actually clinically insane. And yet here we were inviting him to the
                    White House, offering these academic honors to his wife and treating him like
                    royalty. And it stuck in my craw, I must say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the emigration side? What type of emigration
                        was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, the main interest from the U.S. side was in Jewish emigration.
                    There was a sizeable not very happy Jewish community in Romania and many of
                    these people really wanted out of there. There was also some other emigration,
                    other people interested in leaving, but U.S. interest in that wasn't as intense.
                    Mostly it was Jewish emigration that generated lots and lots of lists of people,
                    letters to the Congress, letters from the Congress to the State Department, and
                    communication with the Romanian government. In short a lot of busy work, but
                    with a net payoff, that is, a steady stream of people being allowed to leave,
                    which is a good thing. I don't begrudge the amount of time I put into that. I do
                    think, though, that the focus on emigration as a human rights issue skewed our
                    vision of what really needed to be done in Romania. They needed a lot more than
                    just a freer emigration policy, they needed a whole new approach to running the
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, do you think there was any prospect if we'd played
                        our cards differently to changing anything in Romania?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: A fair question. It's hard to say. You could argue that because, as I
                    believe, Ceausescu was not really all there mentally, that perhaps he would not
                    have responded rationally even to severe pressure. I'm not sure that's true,
                    though. The fact is, we didn't really try it, and so I feel we didn't explore
                    all the options. And it's not just that we didn't explore the options but that
                    the policy we pursued was wrong even if it had turned out to be true that we
                    couldn't make him more liberal. Because we, as I said, were trying to hold him
                    up as an example to other East Europeans, and that was wrong. I mean, it was
                    bound to fail because he was not a useable example.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other issues in '76-'78 that came up with
                        Romania?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: The main argument was about how much we should do for Romania in terms of
                    trade access and, specifically, access to U.S. high technology that might have
                    military applications. That was a running debate. What category should we put
                    the country in? Should we give them special privileges because they had this
                    sort of independent foreign policy? My view by the end of all this was that we
                    were really hoist on our own petard here, we had just put too much enthusiasm
                    into the project. And here, although I have tremendous respect for Harry Barnes,
                    I hold him somewhat to blame for this because he took that hobbyhorse and rode
                    it for all it was worth, of Ceausescu as a special case. I think this was the
                    time for what I consider more traditional diplomacy, a much more relaxed,
                    hands-off, more analytical approach. Let's see what's really in the U.S.
                    interest here instead of getting carried away. So I had a difference of view
                    with the mission on how much we should be doing for Ceausescu, certainly toward
                    the end of my tenure on the desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a Romanian �migr� group that was powerful?
                        Because, you know, particularly in dealing with Central Europe and the
                        Balkans and all, you've got people who've settled in the United States who
                        get very excited about relations with that country and can often display
                        that interest through a couple of congressmen from Gary, Indiana, or
                        something like that. Did you have much of that, did you feel that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: There was some of that but they weren't successful in changing the thrust
                    of U.S. policy, at least not at that time. Eventually, yes. Our policy on human
                    rights changed across the board and we became much more intrusive, shall I say,
                    on issues like a country's treatment of its own citizens. But at that time,
                    although there were lots of people in the U.S. of Romanian origin who said this
                    man is a madman, what are you doing even talking to him, and they demonstrated
                    when he visited the U.S., it didn't change our policy.</p>

                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>SILINS: Well, it made some difference. I wasn't all that impressed with the
                    Carter administration's first steps on human rights policy. I guess I was one of
                    those who thought that you needed to know more than they did before you could
                    presume to lecture countries about how they should be conducting their domestic
                    affairs. I thought that their approach was too simple-minded. I sat in on
                    lectures given to senior Romanian officials by our first assistant secretary for
                    human rights and I could see that they were not having any impact, because the
                    recipients of the lectures didn't believe that the person giving them knew what
                    the country was all about. You know, hadn't been there and so was not in a
                    position to make a judgment. So in that sense it was still too early, the policy
                    had not yet been internalized by the whole department, it was being conducted by
                    people who didn't have the area knowledge, the expertise that was needed in
                    order to be convincing. Their heart was in the right place but they didn't yet
                    have the ability, the weight, the gravitas with their audience to make an
                    impact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in '78, the Carter administration is beginning to
                        get its feet wet, I mean, beginning to take control. Did you see it moving
                        in a more realistic direction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, you remember how the Carter administration ended, and it's hard to
                    say that.... I thought they were projecting an image of weakness globally, and
                    indeed I think that's going to be history's verdict on them, too. That's why,
                    even though it may have sounded as though they were doing exactly what I would
                    have wanted them to do with respect to human rights, it was the way they were
                    doing it that wasn't impressive to me. And some of the people they brought into
                    foreign affairs didn't have the right credentials as far as I was concerned. So,
                    as I say, heart was in the right place but not really able to deliver the goods,
                    in my estimation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left the Romanian desk in '78 for where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Then we went to Haiti. A change of pace, in part I think it was because
                    my career position was not exactly enhanced by the fact that I was probably
                    perceived as dragging my feet on the desk, as I suggested to you. I thought we
                    were, if anything, doing too much with Romania. That's an unfortunate position
                    for a desk officer to be in. A desk officer has to be the senior cheerleader for
                    the policy and I wasn't, didn't feel I could be. Another possible job fell
                    through, a Europe job at the NSC. When that didn't work out, I went to Haiti as
                    the best of the other choices. And I don't regret that, although it's really off
                    my beat.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes, I married an American woman I'd met in Romania, Elizabeth Johnston.
                    We married in 1976, a year after coming back from Romania. At that time I was
                    staying in an apartment very near the Washington Cathedral, so we arranged to be
                    married in the Cathedral's St. John's Chapel, that was the closest church.
                    Ellsworth Bunker and Carol Laise were living just two blocks away at the time,
                    so we invited them, too. Elizabeth and I had a son, Nicholas, the next year. She
                    had been married previously and had three kids from that marriage - Kate,
                    Matthew and Lucas - so I had an instant family.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SILINS: As always, terrible. But not as terrible as it got later. Haiti was still
                    very livable for those who could afford it. We were in the early Baby Doc
                    period. We hadn't quite scoped him out yet, we didn't know whether he had
                    promise or not. The initial readings, of course were, as you recall, negative on
                    Baby Doc. He was called Basket Head because he looked dumb. But during my time
                    there he married Michele Bennett, who seemed to be a very savvy woman from a
                    good family. We thought, okay, maybe this is going to do the trick, maybe she is
                    going to give him some smarts and point him in the right direction. Didn't turn
                    out to be the case, but that wasn't apparent by the time I had left. At the time
                    it was still a pretty tough place, of course very poor, poorest in the Western
                    Hemisphere. We were trying to, now we are into the post-Carter period, we're

                </p>
                <p>SILINS: By post-Carter I mean Carter has arrived, in the sense that we have a
                    more active human rights policy. So one of my jobs was to go around and talk to
                    freethinking people, opposition people, people that didn't think that the
                    country should have a president with lifetime tenure. So that was an interesting
                    part of the job, including one very dramatic example.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>SILINS: Well, this was an attack by the Tontons Macoutes, Haiti's paramilitary
                    thugs who acted as enforcers for the Duvalier regime, on a human rights meeting
                    I had gone to. This was in '79, I guess. The meeting was held in a church
                    auditorium by the Haitian Human Rights League. The group's president, Gerard
                    Gourgue, was giving a talk and he had filled the hall, so you could see there
                    was some real support for these ideas in Haiti despite the oppressive regime. I
                    had arrived a bit late and so I was standing outside by a side door looking into
                    the packed auditorium and listening to the speaker. Just minutes after I arrived
                    the trouble started. A bunch of muscular thugs began to chant DUVALIER!
                    DUVALIER! in deep guttural voices, both inside and outside the auditorium. Then
                    all hell broke loose. Inside, the thugs started smashing the furniture, breaking
                    the legs off the chairs and hitting members of the audience with them. People
                    began streaming out, and as they ran out they were beaten by tontons who were
                    waiting for them outside the door, not far from where I was standing. I stood
                    there appalled, taking it all in as the hall emptied. Then a young woman ran up
                    to me, Gourgue's daughter, and appealed to me for help because her father was
                    being beaten up and her mother as well who was with them. I went back inside
                    with her and saw them.</p>
                <p>By that time the church was almost empty, most of the chairs had been broken up,
                    but there were still three or four of the thugs left. They were leaning
                    menacingly over Gourgue, who was down on one knee on the floor, his hands up
                    trying to protect his head, which was bleeding, these guys were pounding on him,
                    his wife was next to him. I don't know exactly what I thought I was doing but I
                    walked up to Gourgue, pulled him up and began to lead him out of the hall, his
                    wife and daughter following. And at first the tontons let me get away with it,
                    as though I was wrapped in a bubble of diplomatic immunity. And so I got the
                    Gourgues out of the church. But as I led them toward the exit gate, one of the
                    tontons gave me a tremendous whack with the flat of his hand on my left ear. I
                    was stunned, disoriented, almost fell. The blow ruptured my eardrum. I was
                    separated from Gourgue but I learned later that he got to safety; he was taken
                    by a priest into the basement and hidden there. And the tontons didn't attack me
                    any more, so I made my way out to my car, drove home, and reported the incident
                    to our ambassador. Quite a demonstration of the regime's attitude toward human
                    rights at that point in Haiti.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: William Jones.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how did he operate during this difficult
                        situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>SILINS: Well, he immediately contacted the government to protest. Jones tried to
                    keep steady pressure on the government to ease up, but Haiti was a problem for
                    which we had no solution. There was no schism within the embassy as to what to
                    do because none of us knew what the hell to do about the root problem. Haiti is
                    a very difficult place to help. One problem was we could find no solid
                    foundation on which to build. To put it another way, it was obvious there was
                    not much holding the country together, preserving a thin veneer of order. Chaos
                    had swept Haiti in the past, and we didn't see any advantage to Haiti or to the
                    United States of unwittingly precipitating it again through some maladroit
                    experiment. And so while we could have pressured Duvalier more to loosen up than
                    we did, the fact is that we thought we had no real options as to which way to
                    drive him because the place simply wasn't built that way, it wasn't built to
                    support any real programs. When I got there we had spent millions and millions
                    of dollars on assistance programs but had little to show for it. We had reverted
                    to training Haitians rather than doing turnkey projects. AID previously had
                    built things and said okay, here you are, now you run it, and they'd always
                    fail. And so we decided, no more of that. Now what we're going to do is train
                    the Haitians how to help themselves, get them invested in the projects. So
                    consequently we were doing mostly training programs. Whenever we had
                    congressional visitors we had to take them to an Israeli agricultural project
                    because it was the only concrete thing you could show to somebody. So it was a
                    very, very difficult place in that respect. We just didn't know which end to
                    grab it by. And we still don't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, as the political officer, was there the equivalent
                        of a political party, a ruling one, or was it all running out, or was it
                        equivalent to the White House?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: It was a family-run show, the Duvalier operation. Baby Doc had the title
                    of President for Life and the clique of people that had supported his father,
                    Papa Doc, was now supporting him. There was no political party structure. There
                    was, however, an influential group with some impressive individuals, usually
                    called The Elite. These were mostly prosperous rather light-skinned blacks.
                    Haitians, by the way, are sensitive to gradations of color, much more than
                    Americans are. They're appalled that here everybody's called black whether he
                    has � or 1/64th proportion of African heritage. They make more subtle
                    distinctions. And some Haitians looked down on American blacks because they
                    didn't defeat slavery on their own, whereas Haitians take great pride in having
                    defeated Napoleon. That was a bit of a problem for Ambassador Jones, as an
                    African-American.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>Anyway, many of the elite were successful in business. Now, Haiti has no natural
                    resources to speak of. There was a bauxite mine but it was winding down because
                    the ore wasn't of very high quality. That was about it in terms of natural
                    resources. So the business focus was on tourism, assembly operations or
                    low-level manufacturing. Haiti at that time made most of our baseballs and
                    softballs, for example, and some textiles. Just enough to keep a group of people
                    in pretty good comfort. There was very little trickle-down. Most Haitians were
                    desperately poor. And the elite wasn't interested in government; they avoided it
                    like poison because they knew it could be fatal to mess with politics. So there
                    wasn't a middle class in the sense that we conceive of it, a middle class active
                    in social affairs and community affairs and government affairs. There was no
                    sense of civic action. There was a token parliament and that was about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As the political officer what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Traveled around the country, talked to people inside and outside the
                    government. From the elite I picked up some metaphors about life and politics in
                    Haiti. The crab theory of politics explains why it's so hard to rise to a better
                    position in Haiti. Why do crabs find it difficult to escape from a basket?
                    Because the other crabs keep him in there. Then there's the bullwhip theory of
                    politics. It's easy to make people respect you, just keep a bullwhip on the wall
                    behind your desk. They'll know what it's for. It's a country vivid and close to
                    the ground for a political officer. It was educational for me because with the
                    sole exception of Vietnam all of my assignments have been in Europe or close to
                    it.</p>
                <p>As political officer I had no mandate to involve myself in economic development
                    issues, but I visited aid projects, ours and those of other countries, anyway. I
                    also talked to the non-governmental and religious groups that were all trying in
                    their own way to help Haiti become a better place. Some of them were doing
                    wonderful work, but no one seemed to have found what many of us at the embassy
                    were looking for, the secret for bringing lasting political, social and economic
                    development to Haiti on a large scale.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Something that became a chronic problem with the United
                        States was illegal immigration, boat people and all that. Was that going on
                        while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: It was very much going on and I got pushed into the middle of it. I was
                    subpoenaed to testify at the Federal district court in Miami about the treatment
                    of repatriated boat people. I testified that to the best of our knowledge they
                    were not persecuted once they were returned to Haiti, not any more than anyone
                    else was persecuted in Haiti, and not for having tried to take a boat to the
                    U.S. But you've named one of our major interests in Haiti. One of the reasons we
                    wanted to stimulate the economy was to create jobs so people would not flee to
                    Florida. But we were having an awfully hard time doing it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you under a lot of pressure to show that those who
                        were returned to Haiti weren't picked on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: No, I didn't feel pressure because I believed that was the case. Haiti is
                    not like a communist country. The authorities picked on anyone who pissed them
                    off, but they had no special reason to pick on someone who tried to flee the
                    country unless that person owed them money or something like that. Leaving Haiti
                    wasn't against their ideology. In a communist country, if you tried to flee, you
                    were an ideological traitor because you were saying with your feet that this
                    system is not working. The Haitians had no such hang-ups. If things weren't
                    going well here for someone, fine, let them go. They couldn't squeeze anything
                    out of a stone. The boat people were the poorest people, they had nothing to
                    offer to the authorities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the embassy? One of the recurrent themes, and
                        this goes back maybe to the beginning of the 19th century, is that the
                        embassy is often caught up by the elite of a country, socially and all that.
                        Was this at all true?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well yes, I think it's a fair observation. Sure, we saw more of the elite
                    and of the people in government than we saw of the poor Haitians, in part
                    because few of us could speak Creole. The language of the Haitian people, of
                    course, is not French, that's the language of government and of the elite. But
                    most Haitians speak Creole and only Creole. I didn't learn that, so I couldn't
                    deal directly with those that did not have French. So in that respect yes, I
                    plead guilty that I didn't have the ability to deal directly with the average
                    Haitian. We did have people in the embassy, though, that could do that. For
                    example, Cliff Tighe had spent a lot of time in Haiti as a boy because his
                    father was there with the military. He spoke fluent Creole, so he was one of our
                    windows into that community. He was not in the political section, he was a
                    general services officer, but it's a small embassy. So he used to go out and
                    talk to people and see what's on their mind and how things are going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But then, say on a social level, you basically were
                        dealing with a, you might say, a commercial class, who really were avoiding
                        politics? Is that kind of how it fell out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>SILINS: Well, not only with the people who were avoiding politics. I also dealt a
                    lot with the people in the so-called government. You know, the ministers, the
                    members of parliament. Of course, the people in government had some impact.
                    There were also people that had government positions who were not unenlightened.
                    I remember a judge, for example, that we thought very highly of and had a lot of
                    contact with. He was trying to encourage the spread of the rule of law in Haiti,
                    against considerable odds, I might add. Haitians are individually, as people,
                    very impressive. They're energetic, cheerful and optimistic. Despite the
                    horrible conditions they may live in, parents keep trying to raise their kids so
                    that they have a brighter future. Every morning as I would drive to the embassy,
                    the kids were going to school. Emerging from the most horrible slum you'd see a
                    scrubbed and polished little kid with a briefcase going off to school. So
                    there's a lot of will there, but they lacked the basic social and cultural
                    support network.</p>
                <p>Larry Harrison, who was the AID director for part of the time I was in Port au
                    Prince, has written about this at length. He was struck by the dramatic
                    difference between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, which share the island.
                    Over the years he's concluded that it is the culture, the entire system of
                    values and attitudes, that determines whether a society will succeed and whether
                    an aid program can help it. In Haiti, there is a basic flaw in the way in which
                    the people have been socialized that makes it, despite their best intentions and
                    efforts, almost impossible for the country to move forward.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much legal migration to the United States while
                        you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Some, not too much. There was a good deal of travel to the U.S. because
                    of course it's so close, but the consular job there is hellish, with long, long
                    visa lines. Of course, the consuls had to be pretty careful about to whom they
                    issued visas, and they felt badly because more people were going illegally
                    anyway than ones they issued visas to. But there was a fair amount of travel
                    back and forth. The elite, of course, traveled all the time and came back
                    because they were living very comfortably in Haiti. Emigration as such I think
                    was limited because there weren't that many Haitians established legally yet in
                    the U.S. There was a large illegal Haitian community, in New York, of course,
                    also in Florida and in Canada, but they weren't yet in a position to file visa
                    petitions for their relatives.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>SILINS: No, not yet. I think I got out of there just before Haiti got really
                    dangerous, both medically because of AIDS, the AIDS scare came shortly
                    afterwards, violence and drugs. When I was there, safety was a concern only in
                    specific circumstances. For example, security officers told people in the U.S.
                    mission that if they should unfortunately have an auto accident where they hit
                    someone, it was best to keep moving because there is a real danger of being
                    chopped up by irate machete-wielding spectators if you don't. There was a fair
                    amount of theft and burglary. In fact, my house was hit five times, which seemed
                    to me a wretched excess and suggested one of my employees might be involved.
                    There was no violence, although we woke up once at three in the morning with a
                    guy actually in our bedroom going through my wife's purse. But he took off and
                    there was no threat. Shortly after that, though, life there became more
                    dangerous.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 3rd of March 1998. Ints, so in 1980, why
                        Russian language training? I would have thought there would have been a
                        certain ... you'd sort of seen the elephant, or at least your family had.
                        Why did you want to go back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: That's a fair question. As I recall, I was recruited for the job in
                    Leningrad. Actually, I think initially it wasn't clear whether the Department
                    wanted me to go to Leningrad or to Moscow, but one of the two. It probably
                    stemmed from my previous service in Romania and I wouldn't be surprised if Harry
                    Barnes had some role in this. And I did feel ambivalent about it, as you
                    correctly suggest. The idea of going back into the mouth of the whale had
                    interest but also was a bit intimidating for me. And I wasn't the only one
                    feeling ambivalent, so was the office of security in the State Department, which
                    in fact initially opposed my being assigned, after I decided yes, I did want to
                    go to Leningrad. They opposed the assignment not only because I was born in
                    Latvia, which of course Moscow considered part of the Soviet Union, but I still
                    had relatives there, including an aunt, my mother's sister. And so the office of
                    Soviet affairs actually had to get the support of the director general, who at
                    that time was Harry Barnes, whom I'd worked for in Romania, to overrule SY and
                    get my assignment approved.</p>

                        You'd left [Latvia] too early to have picked up any?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Oh right, much too early. I was only two.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you take Russian?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Rosslyn, the FSI building. The Russian language program was still, shall
                    we say, under construction. There was no finished text and they were making it
                    up as they went along. That had both strengths and disadvantages. Some of the
                    instructors were very good, very energetic and imaginative in how they presented
                    the subject. But because there was a lack of overriding structure we felt some
                    frustration. There were also the inevitable sort of political tensions among
                    instructors. I think this is common in all those languages, by which I mean East
                    European, Russian. And so that added some color to the experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give some examples of that, of the tension, of
                        how it demonstrated itself to the students?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, perhaps I shouldn't say there was tension so much as simple
                    differences among the instructors. One of them was Ukrainian, of shall we say a
                    rather conservative bent, and others were of different waves of immigrant,
                    including one rather aristocratic white Russian. And so there were strong
                    differences of style, which frankly I think was all to the good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the Russian training, did you get any feel for or
                        briefings about what you were going to find in the Soviet Union in those
                        days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Oh sure, yes, because it was not just a language training program but
                    also area studies. And so we had lectures, we did a lot of reading about the
                    whole region, the Soviet Union in particular and of course, in my case,
                    Leningrad specifically. So yes, we were quite adequately prepared for the
                    assignment, very thoroughly prepared.</p>

                <p>SILINS: That's right. It was, I think, a nine-month course.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Flew there by the most direct route, as I recall. I don't recall where
                    the stopover was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just wondering whether, sometimes people went to

                </p>
                <p>SILINS: You know, I really don't recall what the route was. One thing I do
                    recall, though. You remember, this is sort of the height of the Cold War period,
                    this is 1981 and Reagan is in the White House and his views about the Soviet
                    Union are well known.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Evil Empire.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Right. I'm not sure he had already called it that but you could see it in
                    his face. But I remember when I got onto the airplane in New York I picked up a
                    copy of The New York Times and found, much to my dismay, in the second section,
                    the Metro section, a long and vivid account about drug dealing in New York by
                    teenagers. And I thought, oh my god, here I am going to the Soviet Union, a
                    representative of the United States, and I'm bringing in what looks like
                    anti-U.S. propaganda. What am I going to do about this? Well of course I went
                    ahead and brought it in but it just struck me at the time as very ironic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Leningrad from 1981 until...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Until '83.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Until '83. Who was the consul general there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: First Chris Squire, who was very easy to work with, very knowledgeable, a
                    very nice man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then?</hi>

                <p>
                    <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill Shinn. What was your impression of Leningrad at that
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, the city was imposing architecturally, as you know. It's a city
                    built by Italian architects, but in Soviet guidebooks they were referred to as
                    “the Russian architect Quarenghi,” for example, which didn't quite ring true.
                    But what struck me was something that I think has struck other people, too — it
                    seemed like a great imperial city that had been taken over by the servant class,
                    if I dare say this. In other words, the appearance of the people didn't fit the
                    grandeur of their surroundings. So that was my first impression.</p>
                <p>But the main thing, of course, is that this was a time of high tension between
                    the U.S. and the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you explain what the situation was in our relations at
                        that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: A time of strong hostility and much tension over espionage. Espionage, in
                    fact, was sort of the master issue that cast its shadow over almost every aspect
                    of our operations and our relationship. Leningrad as a post had its own specific
                    profile. What we were known for, and I think we did very well, was to give a
                    kind of window on the man on the street, a window onto more ordinary life in the
                    Soviet Union as opposed to the kind of analytical stuff that Moscow did. But we
                    also served other functions and they had to do with intelligence gathering of
                    different types, not all of which we can discuss in detail here. One of them, a
                    quite accepted game between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, was military
                    intelligence gathering. Now, we didn't have a resident military attach� but,
                    Leningrad being a major naval base, U.S. naval attach�s would visit us
                    regularly. And they would go through their little choreography with the KGB
                    where they would go down to the areas where ships were built and take pictures
                    and that kind of stuff. And that all usually worked out in a fairly friendly
                    manner, but there were other things going on that were not so nice and in fact
                    just before I arrived had led to some real unpleasantness.</p>
                <p>Now, this is out of the area of intelligence gathering, but what had happened
                    just before I came was that one of our consular officers, Dan Fried, who was not
                    an agent at all, he's not a spy, had been beat up, presumably because he was in
                    active contact with refuseniks, that is, Soviet Jews who were trying to emigrate
                    but had been refused repeatedly. There was other harassment of the consulate
                    going on too, though, which was more focused, shall we say. It turned out
                    subsequently, we didn't know this at the time but I certainly got to know it in
                    detail because I was on the Soviet desk afterwards, that the consulate had been
                    completely penetrated by microphones, so that apparently even what we considered
                    relatively secure areas were bugged and we were probably being monitored in all
                    of our conversations, essentially.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Normally we had these so-called plastic bubbles, these
                        special rooms and all that are supposed to be well protected, but was the
                        feeling that even places such as that were bugged?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, I'm not positive if that's the case. It may be true that there were
                    still some areas where we could have conversations that were not monitored. The
                    fact is that by the placement of microphones elsewhere in the building the KGB
                    could easily determine essentially who was doing what in the consulate because
                    there was no way you could only discuss that sort of thing in the bubble. It had
                    already become clear from the pattern of harassment they engaged in, little
                    things like letting the air out of tires or close surveillance or other kinds of
                    minor damage, that they probably had a good idea of who was doing what in the
                    consulate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of all this effort on the
                        intelligence side? I've often felt that, you know, this intelligence
                        business can get very counterproductive at a certain point. I mean, you're
                        talking about trying to maintain relations with a country and if you're sort
                        of turning the thugs loose to be out there harassing it really doesn't
                        advance any cause at all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, I share your skepticism. My skepticism about the value of certain
                    kinds of intelligence activity grew throughout my career and is quite strong
                    now. There are some things that I think were both useful and necessary given the
                    kind of relationship we had with the Soviet Union, which was intense and
                    competitive. And of course the USSR was a fiercely secretive, closed society. As
                    I mentioned, the sort of open military intelligence gathering, which they also
                    did in the U.S., is something that I think probably was okay. The military
                    always claimed that they learned a lot, that our whole military build-up could
                    be better focused because of our knowledge of what the Soviets were up to. But
                    there are other activities that, it turns out, were not only not productive but
                    sometimes fatal. That is to say, the people that we recruited in the Soviet
                    Union to be agents for us, almost all of them were known to the Soviet
                    government. That was, of course, either fatal to them in terms of being executed
                    or it ended their useful lives in that country and many of them, of course,
                    couldn't get out. I think that was very, very unfortunate. As I mentioned, it is
                    clear that the KGB knew almost everything that we were doing and so they were
                    able to plant false information and they were able to round up all the people
                    they thought were really dangerous to them. So we were not really accomplishing
                    anything, we were just adding to the tension between the two countries by those
                    kinds of activities. So I agree with you, I think that often they were not
                    productive. I believe that even today the resources that we dedicate to
                    espionage are way out of proportion to the resources that we dedicate to
                    classical diplomacy, and I think that balance needs to be redressed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your particular position in the consulate
                        general?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>SILINS: I was the number two, the deputy principal officer. I was responsible, as
                    a DCM would be, for managing the mission for the consul general, as well as for
                    overseeing economic and political reporting. On the reporting side, as I said,
                    what we did was to try to throw a light on ordinary life and so we had as many
                    contacts as we could with people outside the official realm and we also went to
                    lectures, public lectures, of any kind that we could get into. The most well
                    attended series was by the Znanie Society, the Knowledge Society. They covered
                    all kinds of topics, one that I remember particularly was one in which I was the
                    first to hear an announcement of the grain harvest figures for the previous
                    couple of years. The Soviet Union was doing very badly in agriculture and so
                    they had stopped publishing the statistics. The numbers were of great interest
                    to us because we were also trying to sell grain, and of course the Soviets had a
                    big place in our market as consumers but also they tended to export some. So
                    that was a number of some significance that I was able to get in that way. But
                    mostly it was more routine things that we obtained, little snippets about...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In speaking to others who served in the Soviet Union at

                        were saying one of the most interesting things was the reaction of the
                        people to it. In other words, it was not just some apparatchik lecturing, I
                        mean, there was a real give and take from the people, you got much more of a
                        feeling of what subjects moved the Soviet people. Did you find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: At the time that I was covering the lectures, people were more careful
                    about showing their opinion than they were later. I should have mentioned at the
                    beginning that I took up this job a time when the Solidarity movement in Poland
                    had become active and strong, to an extent that scared Moscow. They were afraid
                    that this virus was going to spread, and of course Leningrad and the Baltic
                    States in particular were very close to Poland and subject to that infection. So
                    they clamped down particularly hard on the Leningrad area, already known as a
                    place where the KGB tried out its tricks. Because it was close to the West, it
                    was where the KGB refined its techniques in political control and
                    counterespionage. So it was a pretty tough area, and ordinary Russians there had
                    learned how to mask their reactions and were not sticking their necks out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the artistic life and the intelligentsia? Were
                        you able to have any meaningful contacts with that group?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>SILINS: We had a lot of contacts with that group. We had contacts with them in
                    their homes and apartments, we invited them to the consulate and even sometimes
                    to the consulate's dacha. We had a regular film series in the consul general's
                    residence and people like that would come. They ironically called themselves
                    “the KGB's entertainment committee for the diplomatic corps.” They were
                    signaling to us, “Look, there are rules governing this, we have to report our
                    conversations to the KGB, they let us see you because it keeps you from talking
                    to more dangerous people.” And so that was part of the big game, too.
                    Nevertheless we were, simply by going around and going to the buildings where
                    they lived, able to have some idea what life was really like in the Soviet
                    Union. In my case I had I think exceptional opportunities to see what real life
                    was like, because our consulate general in Leningrad was also responsible for
                    reporting on the Baltic capitals, that indeed was the reason why I finally
                    decided to ask for the assignment. And I started going regularly to Tallinn,
                    Vilnius and Riga. In Riga, as I mentioned, I had relatives and friends of the
                    family and so I was able to see what ordinary life was like. But I have to say
                    right up front here that I was probably not a terribly productive reporter
                    because I always felt very conscious, not just with respect to my relatives but
                    with everyone, that they would have to deal with the KGB after our meetings. So
                    I was not aggressive in trying to get them to, you know, tell me how bad the
                    government is, to make statements that could land them in hot water. I relied
                    more on observation than interrogation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would expect that you would have been subjected to
                        considerable harassment by the KGB every time you went to the Baltic
                        States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Only once was the surveillance unusually aggressive. First of all, the
                    KGB routine was pretty much the following. When you first arrived in Leningrad
                    you'd be pretty closely followed for about a month or so while they got down
                    your basic pattern. After that, unless you were working in intelligence, they
                    really didn't bother you very much, and I found that to be true in my case. When
                    I went to the Baltic capitals, certainly on my first visit, I knew I was being
                    followed but they tried to keep it fairly discreet despite the fact, which I
                    didn't mention in our previous conversation, that on the way to my first visit
                    to Riga in 1975, a personal visit not an official visit, I had actually yielded
                    to the temptation, which I admit was unprofessional, of playing games with the
                    KGB. I tried to lose them and I think I did lose them in the subway, for no
                    particular reason other than that I don't like being followed. This was in
                    Leningrad, not Riga; Riga has no subway. That might have been taken as
                    justification for the KGB to, you know, keep a close eye on me in the future,
                    but I did it only as a lark, frankly, because they were getting on my nerves,
                    not because I had anything to hide.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>When I was visiting the Baltic capitals officially in the early '80s, the only
                    time I experienced really aggressive surveillance was in Vilnius. By accident I
                    came across an active dissident in a caf�, someone who had signed a manifesto
                    against the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. I started talking to him and walking around
                    with him, at which point the KGB was all over us like flies - Elizabeth was with
                    me - and visibly trying to scare him off and scare me away from talking to him.
                    But that's the only time they were aggressive. Other times I could tell they
                    were there, but staying in the background.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this '81-'83 period again was early Reagan, and it
                        was prior to Gorbachev, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes, Gorbachev was in the Politburo but he was not yet a sure thing as a
                    future leader.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when the various leaders were dying over
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Right. Brezhnev was in power when I arrived, he died while I was in
                    Leningrad and was replaced by Andropov. I might mention that when Brezhnev died
                    there was the usual sort of hiatus before the death was actually announced.
                    There was a fairly long period of somber classical music on Soviet radio as the
                    leadership lined up their ducks. The morning they finally announced his death I
                    had just taken Elizabeth to the train station to go off to Helsinki for some
                    dental work and so I was taking care of our son Nico, who was about five years
                    old at the time. Elizabeth gets on the train, we get back in the car, I turn on
                    the radio and there's the announcement that Brezhnev is dead. So my first
                    impulse, of course, is to go around and try to measure the public reaction to
                    that. I took Nico along and we rode the subways and the buses and walked the
                    sidewalks and tried to cover as much of the city as we could, to see what the
                    reaction was. Interesting thing was, there was no reaction. It was very amusing.
                    There was no reaction, although of course people had the radio on and the
                    announcement was being made and so everyone knew, but there was no reaction. I
                    guess they figured he had been as good as dead for a long time anyway. The only
                    reaction I could elicit from a man on the street was a blast against Brezhnev:
                    “Good riddance, he did a lot of the damage to the [Russian Orthodox]
                    church.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The war in Afghanistan was still going on and it seemed
                        that there was going to be no end at this point. It started in December of
                        '79. Was Afghanistan and the Russian reaction where you were a matter of
                        interest to our consulate general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, it affected U.S.-Soviet relations and therefore impacted on the
                    atmosphere in which we worked. But our emphasis, as I said, was more on Soviet
                    internal issues and so we didn't really get much into foreign policy stuff with
                    them. So Afghanistan was not a direct issue for us, no.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Baltic republics, were you and the embassy,
                        not just you, looking to see what might happen? I mean, was there any
                        feeling that eventually the Soviet Union might disintegrate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: During this whole time, as you know, it had been our policy not to regard
                    the Baltic States as an integral part of the Soviet Union, so we took various
                    elaborate steps to make sure that our policy of non-recognition was not
                    undercut. Among other things, we included in our consular district only the
                    capitals of the Baltic States, not their entire territory. We also had
                    restrictions on the rank of the American diplomats who could go there. For
                    example, the ambassador never went to the Baltic capitals from Moscow and indeed
                    the consul general never went from Leningrad, at least in my time. One of the
                    ways in which I might say we actually expanded our non-recognition policy toward
                    the Baltic States was that we, in fact I, drafted the first human rights reports
                    on the Baltic States that were separate from the human rights report on the
                    Soviet Union, to underline that we regarded them as separate territories. That
                    said, I don't know of anyone at the consulate general or the embassy, myself
                    included, who thought that in less than a decade the Baltic States would once
                    again be independent and the USSR would be coming apart at the seams.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we feel about the human rights aspect of the
                        Helsinki Accords at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: We thought that that was the most promising aspect of the Helsinki
                    process and we were trying as hard as we could to use Basket III as a lever to
                    open up opportunities with respect to the Soviet Union.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well yes, there was a regular dialogue back and forth. By this time, as
                    you know, we were doing annual human rights reports which are quite detailed and
                    covered all aspects of the situation. There were also I think already at that
                    time even more frequent CSCE (Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe)
                    implementation reports being done.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's OSCE (Organization for Security and Cooperation in
                        Europe) now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: It's now OSCE, yes. Well, the original title was Conference on Security
                    and Cooperation in Europe. Conference because it had no independent structure,
                    it was really an ongoing negotiation between all the European countries plus
                    Canada and the U.S. It turned into a very useful forum and acquired a structure.
                    So within the CSCE context there was also very intense discussion between our
                    governments, Soviet and U.S., and in fact all East European governments on human
                    rights issues, among other things. So yes, we were very busily working in the
                    human rights field at that time. Plus emigration, of course, which had already
                    been a major focus of interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was emigration going strictly from Moscow or were you
                        involved in Leningrad?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: We were very much involved in Leningrad. There was a Jewish community
                    that was quite active in Leningrad, refuseniks who were trying to get out and
                    whom we were trying to help get out of there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that work? Was it still under the general mantle
                        of emigration to Israel, although a good number didn't go to Israel, but was
                        this still how it was structured?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: It had a broader basis now because of the CSCE conference. That is, our
                    interest in the past used to be more narrowly focused on Jewish emigration, but
                    because the CSCE conference had now broadened each country's obligations on
                    human rights issues, including emigration, we were able to put it on a broader
                    footing and argue that any signatory country was obligated to let people
                    emigrate if they wanted to emigrate.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Grudgingly, to say the least. Their problem, of course, was they were
                    afraid that it would open the floodgates. Their leadership knew very well that
                    their system was unpopular and that if they were to enable everyone who wanted
                    to go to leave they would lose many of their most talented people, so they were
                    fighting like mad to keep the doors closed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that reflect as far as you were seeing things?
                        People who would come to you to apply or I mean, were they kept from
                        applying, or how did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>SILINS: Oh, it would work in different ways. Many of them would come to us and
                    say they had been prevented from even obtaining application forms. Others who
                    had succeeded in getting applications wouldn't have them accepted by the
                    authorities, they would be turned down for various technicalities. Others would
                    submit their applications and then would be refused permission to depart, for
                    example on the argument that at some time they had had access to classified
                    information. So there were lots and lots of different reasons. There was also
                    the argument that, well, I'm sorry, you can't leave because you owe money or
                    because the state has invested in your education and therefore that has to be
                    paid back first. So there were endless arguments about this sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find on this subject and other matters dealing
                        with both the city government and other elements of the government in your
                        consular district?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: We had some meetings with what was called OVIR, which handles visas and
                    emigration issues, but for the most part our discussions with the city
                    government were about operational issues, like support to the consulate, housing
                    matters or staffing issues, that sort of thing, or courtesy calls and
                    discussions for information about economic issues or what have you. So it was
                    quite a different relationship from what the embassy in Moscow had with the
                    ministries in Moscow. As I say, our focus was primarily on internal
                    developments, not so much on the bilateral U.S.-USSR policy front.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have consular problems such as American tourists
                        getting there and getting into trouble and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Oh sure. We had a whole range of things, including tourists dying. An
                    elderly gentleman with a younger wife had become ill at their hotel but she
                    refused to let him receive medical treatment. “Don't give him anything but
                    enemas!” she insisted. He duly died and she departed as soon as she had obtained
                    the documents she needed for insurance purposes. So we had that sort of thing,
                    yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>I vividly remember, too, the death of an American exchange professor who was
                    visiting Latvia. Although he was 60 or so, his family claimed he had been in the
                    pink of health and refused to believe he had died of a heart attack. They
                    insisted that someone from the consulate go to Riga and attend the autopsy. As
                    the consulate's resident Latvian, I was the obvious choice. In Riga I found the
                    hospital leadership and relevant medical staff lined up to receive me at the
                    hospital entrance as though I were some visiting surgeon general. They asked
                    whether I wanted to view the entire autopsy or come in at the conclusion. I
                    chose the latter. When I was invited in, the departed had been entirely
                    disassembled and laid out on two metal tables. The head pathologist showed me
                    scar tissue in the professor's heart that indicated previous heart trouble,
                    probably mistaken for indigestion, and confirmed the diagnosis of a heart attack
                    as cause of death. They could not have been more cooperative.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about arrest cases?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I don't recall too much on that front. We had problems occasionally with
                    the Marines working at the consulate, little pranks that they would pull. For
                    example, once they swiped a Soviet flag, which led to a little bit of tension.
                    But I don't recall anything serious.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation with the local staff, the Soviet
                        nationals who worked for the embassy? Because there'd been problems earlier
                        on, how was that working while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, I can't really think back to this without laughing because it was a
                    comical situation, as we know now from hindsight. All our local employees were
                    provided through a Soviet agency, of course, and so clearly they were selected
                    because they could provide functions for the Soviet government, including the
                    security services, not just to the consulate. And they provided us with some
                    exceptional people, one of them a striking tall blonde who was the daughter of a
                    man who I believe was the head of cultural affairs for the city of Leningrad.
                    She was a real knockout and would just melt the Marines by looking at them. We
                    also hired a Russian language instructor who was a slightly different type but
                    also extremely attractive and also able to melt hearts with the crook of her
                    little finger. So the KGB was sparing no effort in beautifying the
                    consulate.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>We also had a tragedy. The Marine Gunnery Sergeant was making his rounds one
                    night. He had apparently climbed up in an awkward position to look out a
                    staircase window at another window across the courtyard which looked onto our
                    compound and which we knew was manned by Soviet security, and he fell. He fell
                    and he had serious brain injuries. This happened at a time when I was in
                    Helsinki. I arrived back a few days later and went to the hospital to visit him.
                    We had to take him to a Soviet hospital, there was no choice at all because he
                    would have died if we'd tried to move him out of the country. And so it was a
                    very unusual situation where the senior Marine was given medical treatment in a
                    Soviet facility. We set up a system of having someone there at all times but of
                    course we couldn't actually be in the room when he was being treated. He had to
                    have brain surgery, life-saving surgery, and they did save his life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Marine guard system? The British tend
                        to use retired sergeants and the like for their security people. The
                        Marines, I know from my experience in Yugoslavia 20 years before, can prove
                        to be a problem because they're young, lusty young men and up to pranks and
                        drinking and everything else.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, that's quite true. You have to take into account what hormones will
                    do to the body of a young Marine. But frankly I like the Marines and I like the
                    Marine security guard system. I like the uplift they give to the whole mission.
                    They bring to it an energy, a pride that I think is worth the trouble. So I'm
                    very happy with the system, frankly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find from your local staff that despite the fact
                        you knew where they were coming from and all, it was still a reflection of
                        the society? I mean, these were people you could talk to and, you know, get
                        a feel for the country and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Right. We decided that the advantages outweighed the disadvantages. We
                    could, as you suggest, learn from them. And having people with very good
                    connections in the Soviet government working in the consulate has lots of
                    advantages. For example, we could get tickets to the Kirov Ballet at the snap of
                    a finger, which is not to be sneezed at as a cultural experience. Also, lots of
                    what we wanted to know was harmless and lots of what we did was harmless, by
                    which I mean that most of diplomacy, in my estimation, does not need to be
                    covert and does not need to be hidden, even from an enemy, because it doesn't
                    give the enemy any advantage. One of the strengths of the United States has
                    always been that we're so open that we flood our enemies with information. They
                    don't know what to make of it, they don't know how to interpret the Congress any
                    better than we do. So there's no need to hide all of these things. So I thought
                    that we went way too far later, while I was on the Soviet desk, when we fired
                    all of the local employees and tried to replace them with American contractors.
                    That just created a different set of security problems, not necessarily less
                    severe.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, during this time, looking at the system, you had a
                        leadership at the top which was either dead or dying with both Brezhnev and
                        Andropov and sort of a never-ending war seemingly going on in Afghanistan
                        and all. While you were looking at internal things, did you get any feel for
                        the spirit of your consular district? I mean, about how they felt about the
                        Soviet Union at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: It was apparent to us that almost everybody was cynical about the Soviet
                    system. There were very, very few true believers by that time, even at senior
                    levels. And so even though U.S.-Soviet relations were at a low point, internally
                    in the Soviet Union I felt that change was inevitable, it was just a question of
                    how rapid the pace of that change would be. What happened, of course, was that
                    Brezhnev was replaced by Andropov, who also turned out to be sick and died a
                    year later. Before he died, Andropov launched some reforms, including economic
                    ones, which didn't go very far in themselves, but they contained another
                    message. The message was that there was a recognition at the top that the
                    problems of the USSR were very serious and that even though the leadership was
                    not yet ready to take dramatic steps to deal with them, they at least were
                    beginning to recognize them, so more far-reaching measures were coming down the
                    road.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the knowledge of the people you would talk to
                        about what was happening elsewhere in the world? I mean, were they familiar
                        with, you know, how badly off the Soviet Union was compared to the
                        West?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Those who had access to information from the West, and in Leningrad that
                    was a lot of people because it was a popular tourist destination, probably had
                    an exaggerated sense of how well off we were compared to them. They thought at
                    that time, I believe, that we were some sort of paradise and so actually
                    exaggerated the difference in many respects.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SILINS: No, I think that came later. I don't recall that there was yet a big

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just wondering whether there was any back and forth
                        of people who had left the Soviet Union supposedly on their way to Israel

                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>SILINS: The Soviet authorities would occasionally publish so-called
                    acknowledgments by Jews who had gone to Israel, had been totally disillusioned,
                    and had come back to the Motherland. It was hard to tell how much of that was
                    accurate. Probably not much. At that time there was a pretty high dropout rate,
                    as I recall, by Soviet Jews who departed the USSR to go to Israel but then
                    changed course in Vienna and then went somewhere else, typically the U.S. No
                    doubt those who left, whether for Israel or elsewhere, kept in touch in some way
                    with their friends and relatives in the USSR, and kept them informed about how
                    things were in the outside world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just wondering because, although the program was
                        reportedly to help Jews go to Israel, the great majority had no intention of
                        staying, a solid majority was going to the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>What about youth, particularly at the university level and all that? Was there
                    any sort of contact with them?</p>
                <p>SILINS: There was a fair amount of contact because there were also American
                    students in Leningrad. So we could learn both directly through our contacts with
                    Russian students and from talking to American students what their attitudes
                    were. We didn't get the impression that Soviet students were going to be the
                    cutting edge of political change. What we got was a reading that students were
                    cynical about the system, were not true believers, would certainly welcome some
                    change, but this was not one of those countries where students take to the
                    streets and lead the revolution. We never got that impression in Leningrad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did one feel that the leadership for a new Russia, a
                        new Soviet Union might come from if there was a target group?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>SILINS: I'm not sure that we had a target group or that we were trying to build
                    such an organization. The feeling was, which I think was largely proved true,
                    that the Soviet leadership itself, that is the younger elements of it, those who
                    had not aged so much that they were simply unable to accept that they had been
                    wrong from the beginning, that the younger leadership itself would realize that
                    the system simply couldn't go on as it was. They already were getting reports
                    from their intelligentsia that they had to make radical political and economic
                    reforms in order to avoid sinking below the level of countries like India and
                    Brazil. This was the time when demographic analysis of the USSR was being done
                    in the U.S. by Murray Feshbach, our leading expert at that time. He had begun to
                    publicize the facts, which presumably the Soviet leadership already knew, that
                    the USSR was the only industrial country in the world in which male life
                    expectancy was diminishing, in which the infant mortality rate was rapidly
                    climbing, and in which of course the alcoholism rate was reaching stupefying,
                    literally, proportions. They knew all that and their own intelligentsia, their
                    own academics knew that and were beginning to muster up enough courage to write
                    reports, internal reports to the leadership that something had to be done about
                    this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As one went about, did you go out into the consular

                </p>
                <p>SILINS: We were covering essentially from Murmansk up in the north down to the
                    Novgorod area and then of course the Baltic areas. I personally concentrated on
                    the Baltic area. I went there regularly and probably made four or five visits to
                    each of the Baltic capitals. I also went to Novgorod but there wasn't much
                    happening there, which is not true today. In fact just yesterday I went to a
                    talk by the governor of Veliki Novgorod here at the Kennan Institute, there's a
                    lot happening in Novgorod now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about to the north, Murmansk and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: People from the consulate would regularly go up there and see what was
                    happening. But in a political sense there wasn't much going on up there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any feeling about the Soviet economy,
                        both from being in Leningrad but also in these travels? You know, the Soviet
                        Union was, particularly in the early Reagan period and before, being painted
                        as a very dangerous enemy. Were you seeing any problems with the
                        economy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>SILINS: Oh sure. We knew the economy was a shambles and so did the Soviet
                    leadership. But the fact is that although we can today say with even more
                    assurance that it was in terrible shape and simply doomed to collapse at some
                    point, the fact is that they did have an enormous stockpile of lethal nuclear
                    and other weapons. Their military, while probably somewhat overrated by us as a
                    threat, was nevertheless a big and pretty competent force. So it's not true that
                    the Soviet Union was entirely a paper tiger that should have been dismissed with
                    the wave of a hand. It could not be dismissed. It was a dangerous place.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other countries that had consulates in

                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes, there were quite a few because of course it was considered an
                    important city. The French and the Japanese and the Germans were quite active
                    and there were a number of others.</p>

                <p>SILINS: Well sure. That's what diplomats do, diplomats gather intelligence, and
                    there's nothing unusual about that.</p>

                <p>SILINS: Oh yes. We had frequent meetings. We didn't have formal conferences but
                    we saw each other all the time. Because of the restrictions on contacts with
                    Soviet citizens we saw a lot of each other, so of course we swapped information
                    all the time within the diplomatic corps.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, it looked like it was really dragging its feet. A thumbnail sketch
                    would be that I believed that the leadership did realize how bad the situation
                    was. It couldn't help but realize it, but there were still a number of
                    entrenched interests in the Central Committee and Politburo that were holding up
                    progress, and it was not predictable at that time in which direction they would
                    go. All we could tell was that some change had to be made, that there was a
                    growing realization of that, but it was not clear that they were going to bite
                    the bullet at that point.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Reagan administration was brand new during the time
                        you were there and these were people who were coming, for the most part, out
                        of conservative circles in California and elsewhere, they were not part of
                        the so-called Eastern Establishment, which had reached certain
                        accommodations with the world and the Soviets and all. Did you feel that
                        there was a different direction as far as what you were looking at, how you
                        were reporting or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Perhaps we can go into this in more depth when I talk about my job on the
                    Soviet desk during the last part of the Reagan administration. As regards this
                    assignment, again I have to emphasize that the focus of the U.S. consulate
                    general was on domestic Soviet developments, not on the U.S.-Soviet relationship
                    per se, and so we didn't really feel directly any policy outputs from Washington
                    on how to conduct that relationship. In fact, I suppose somewhat foolishly we
                    took a pride in that. I very infrequently went to embassy Moscow and we didn't
                    really seek their guidance or input very much. We felt we had our own role to
                    play and we were trying hard to play it as well as we could, but it was
                    different from that of embassy Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it's a little bit like God bless the czar and keep
                        him far away, which is the essence of that prayer. Who was our ambassador at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Art Hartman was ambassador for most my time but I'm not sure he was
                    already in place when I arrived.</p>

                <p>SILINS: He came down at least once or twice, yes. I don't mean to imply there was
                    no contact at all with the embassy.</p>

                        interlude... It's been almost 20 years, hasn't it, or something like
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I hope it's not quite that long.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not that long, eleven years. And Ints, last time we left
                        off we were at 1983, and you were off to Stockholm. What was your job going
                        to be at Stockholm?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Political counselor. I was coming from Leningrad, as it was then called,
                    which had been a very interesting assignment during a not very pleasant phase,
                    actually, of the U.S.-Soviet relationship. In Stockholm there was also a
                    U.S.-Soviet angle. In one aspect of that I was only peripherally involved. There
                    was a long-term arms control negotiation running with the Soviets for which we
                    had a negotiating team in Stockholm, and I was their embassy contact person.</p>
                <p>But the Soviet angle was also quite alive in the relationship with Sweden because
                    of the notorious “Whiskey on the Rocks” submarine incident. The Soviets had
                    managed to run a Whiskey class submarine aground in Swedish waters in 1981, very
                    near Sweden's main naval base at Karlskrona. It was a serious incident and led
                    to a tense standoff at the time, made worse by the fact that the Swedes thought
                    they detected nuclear weapons on board. And ever since that the Swedes were
                    keenly alert to any sign of violation of their waters. They kept getting
                    signals, and they couldn't tell if they were really detecting submarines or is
                    this coming from beavers or some kind of animal or what? So they needed
                    technical help, and there was actually quite a lot of under the table
                    cooperation between the Swedes and the U.S. on this topic. It was under the
                    table because Sweden of course made a great point of being a neutral country.
                    Unlike Norway, Sweden was not a member of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty
                    Organization), and it wanted to present a public profile of being even-handed
                    between us and the Soviet Union. Indeed when it came to public opinion in
                    Sweden, the U.S. was still not very popular at this time because of the Vietnam
                    War. Sweden had been very active in criticizing our intervention in Vietnam, and
                    that ill feeling hadn't yet worn off.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>I should also mention another U.S.-Soviet angle, which was not profound but I
                    still get a tickle thinking about it. There is a fantastic aircraft that was
                    developed for the CIA, a multi-supersonic reconnaissance jet, the SR-71, also
                    known as the Blackbird. From time to time a Blackbird would come screaming in
                    over the Baltic Sea from the west. Typically it would come in along the southern
                    edge of the Baltic, passing near Poland and the Baltic States, then make a sharp
                    U-turn near the Soviet border, near Leningrad, in fact, and then come back,
                    theoretically over international waters, heading back west. Its purpose was
                    signals intelligence and aerial photography, and indeed part of what it was
                    trying to do was to trigger the Soviet air defense mechanisms so that we could
                    get a reading on where their radars were and how they worked. This aircraft was
                    going so fast - “traveling with the speed of heat,” as one person described it -
                    that it occasionally couldn't make the turn tight enough. It might nick Swedish
                    airspace, which led to a rather elaborate dance. The Swedes, because they knew
                    that the Soviets could see on their radars that the Blackbird had violated
                    Swedish airspace, had to protest this violation. So what they did was to call me
                    in, I was the political counselor and the person designated to deal with this
                    task... call me in and sternly chew me out for the U.S. violation of their
                    airspace. And then we would part company and go our separate ways until the next
                    incident. Perhaps a similar ritual was being enacted in Helsinki.</p>
                <p>As I say, this is not a particularly profound thing, but I happen to be a deep
                    admirer of the technology that went into the SR-71. It was a fantastic aircraft
                    and having this slight connection with it gives me a tickle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I spent some time a little earlier in Seoul, South Korea,
                        and sometimes we'd be awakened at night when this thing would come over.
                        They make a lot of noise.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>You were in Stockholm from when to when?</p>
                <p>SILINS: Eighty-three to '86.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Let's see. There were two in my time there, and I remember that both were
                    Mormons, just by coincidence ... although it turns out that in that period a
                    number of our ambassadors in the Nordic area were of the Mormon faith. The first
                    one was an older man, Franklin Forsberg, in fact he celebrated his eightieth
                    birthday on the job. The second was Greg Newell, who was younger but also of
                    that persuasion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, I assume the Mormons had fairly active
                        missionaries there. So many of the people who served as missionaries wanted
                        to go back, you know, they had connections and all.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>Speaking of the submarine thing, I assume our Navy was very much aware. They sure
                    as hell didn't want to get involved in any intrusion into Swedish space... or in
                    fact, did we have submarines operating in the Baltic?</p>
                <p>SILINS: I don't know whether we did or not. We would occasionally bring other
                    types of warships into the Baltic, simply to demonstrate that it was not a
                    Soviet lake and that we had the right of free passage. About submarines, I
                    really can't say. I would guess not, because it's such a difficult area to get
                    into and out of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure. And I would imagine if anybody did it, it would be
                        the Germans, maybe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>How did you find the political situation as it connected with the United States?
                    I mean, the Vietnam War was over about eight years or so ago.</p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, it still cast a lingering shadow over our relations because so many
                    Swedes felt so deeply about it. And by the way, were largely justified, it seems
                    in hindsight, in being very critical of U.S. actions during the Vietnam period.
                    The Swedes also still had what, from our point of view, was a preachy and
                    self-satisfied attitude. The Swedes have seldom been reluctant to give advice to
                    other peoples or countries, and their prime minister, Olof Palme, was, if
                    anything, particularly prone to do that. And the secretary general of the
                    foreign ministry, Pierre Schori, who was very close to Palme, was outspokenly
                    critical of what he considered imperialist U.S. policies. So that affected the
                    tone of relations a bit. I remember once bringing a visiting official from
                    Washington into Schori's office just after some Central American or Caribbean
                    incident and being greeted with a snide, “Well, I assume you're not armed!”</p>
                <p>I don't want to give the impression that relations were bad. They were friendly
                    and cooperative. As I suggested, even with respect to security matters there was
                    quite a lot of cooperation going on beyond what you would normally expect, given
                    the public postures that the Swedes took.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in many ways the Swedes were probably more
                        interested in and invested in military preparedness than most Europeans,
                        weren't they? I mean, because they kind of had to do it on their own since
                        they couldn't rely on NATO to take care of them.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>SILINS: Right. That's a good point. They were just as active as the Swiss, for
                    example, in structuring their self defense forces and they went to great lengths
                    technologically to at least present the fa�ade of being able to defend
                    themselves. For example, their highway system is built with widened stretches of
                    straight road useable as landing strips for their military aircraft in case of
                    invasion. They would regularly exercise their self-defense forces. So yes, they
                    made a great point of being militarily capable, including the manufacture of jet
                    aircraft and heavy artillery.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they have universal military training there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes, I believe they did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Sweden act among its Baltic neighbors? Did it see
                        itself as the leader?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I believe it did. During this period Sweden was still viewed as having
                    discovered that magic middle way between capitalism and communism. They were
                    very prosperous and therefore felt that they had lessons to offer to others, not
                    just about how to run the economy but how to build a healthy society, how to
                    eliminate the large amounts of inequality that existed in other... in many
                    capitalist countries. They still felt that they were in the lead, a bit ahead, a
                    step ahead of the Norwegians and the Danes and the Finns. That era ended,
                    actually, pretty close to this time, but they still felt that way.</p>
                <p>As for their more distant Baltic neighbors - Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia -
                    there I have to say that the record of the Palme government was quite
                    disappointing. Palme had a personal connection to Latvia through his mother and
                    had spent summers there as a boy. Despite that, he showed no inclination to
                    stand up for the Balts against Russia in any way that I could see. Of course,
                    that was more or less Swedish policy since World War II. Sweden had been quick
                    to recognize the incorporation of the Baltic States by the USSR. There was an
                    episode when some Latvian soldiers who had fled to Sweden were forcibly sent
                    back to the USSR after the war. The soldiers protested fiercely, knowing what
                    horrors awaited them, and I believe one committed suicide. This episode became
                    the subject of annual Swedish expressions of remorse after the Baltic States
                    regained their independence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were they treating their Gastarbeiter, their foreign
                        workers? Our maid, Vera Losiciu ... When we were in Yugoslavia some years
                        before, she went to Sweden and worked in the Volvo factory. How were they
                        treated at that time, the immigrants?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>SILINS: To the best of my recollection, at that time there were still relatively
                    few immigrants there and so it wasn't much of an issue yet. But you could see
                    from occasional graffiti that some Swedes were no less prone than other
                    countries to react negatively against people unlike themselves. You could
                    already begin to sense the beginning of a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the media? I always think of the media, you
                        know, as spending an awful lot of time pointing out the warts of the United
                        States, the problems of the United States. Did you find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: The media as willing to point out warts in Sweden...?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: TV and newspapers, particularly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I would say that Sweden had among the freest media in the world and they
                    were not averse to criticizing their own country or government as well as
                    ours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation there? Were there two
                        major parties?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: The dominant party since the end of World War II was the Social
                    Democrats. Beginning in 1976, though, as the bloom began to fade from the
                    economy, sometimes the non-socialistmeaning the Moderates, the Center party and
                    the Liberalsometimes managed to muster enough votes among themselves to form a
                    government. As you can imagine, all of the non-socialists, although they were
                    called “bourgeois” parties in Sweden, would fall well to the left of center on
                    most issues in U.S. politics. They put together a center-right government in
                    1979 but it broke up. And so the Social Democrats, with Olof Palme as prime
                    minister, returned to power in 1982, the year before I arrived on the scene.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>Palme's assassination in 1986 was perhaps the most dramatic event during my time
                    there. This was when security for top government figures was not raised to the
                    paranoid level that it is today. Palme would sometimes simply walk around
                    Stockholm, he would walk back and forth to his office. And this particular
                    evening he and his wife had gone to the movie theater and were walking back
                    home, and he was shot on the sidewalk. His wife was also wounded. And as it
                    happens, because I was the embassy duty officer, I wound up informing the
                    foreign ministry duty officer and through him much of the government that the
                    assassination had taken place. That was because the shooting had immediately
                    been reported by the Swedish media and picked up in the States, where we monitor
                    the media very actively, before most Swedes had heard anything about it. So the
                    news reached the State department operations center, which passed it to me after
                    midnight. I called the foreign ministry duty officer, who passed it to the
                    cabinet duty officeand so on to the rest of the Swedish government. It came as a
                    tremendous shock, of course, to the Swedes. They just couldn't imagine that
                    something like that could happen in their country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a resolution as to why it happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: It was kicked back and forth over the years and frankly I simply stopped
                    following it. After a botched initial investigation, there were several arrests
                    and then a conviction, but it was overturned. To my knowledge, it's not certain
                    who did it or why.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Was the United States at all blamed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: No, there was no serious suggestion that the U.S. was behind it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Swedes get along during your time with
                        Finland? Finland always had this rather dicey role of being next to the
                        Soviets and having to accommodate them but yet pursue an independent
                        course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: The Swedes still thought themselves several steps ahead of the Finns, but
                    you could tell that the situation was changing. The Finns are people that I
                    admire greatly. They're extremely skilled, imaginative, innovative and
                    determined. They've learned to play the very bad hand that they've been dealt
                    geographically and economically. They were already developing the design skills
                    at this time that in some ways put them ahead of the Swedes later. But the
                    Swedes still thought that they were the older brother of the Finns and,
                    generally speaking, acted accordingly.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about with the Norwegians? As I understand the area is
                        replete with jokes, both by the Swedes and the Norwegians about each other,
                        you know. How were relations at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: There was less contact between the Norwegians and the Swedes because in
                    general the Norwegians are more westward-looking, given their geography. And
                    they were active NATO members and they brought a different mentality to the
                    game. So although all the Scandinavians had an active, official network of
                    interaction through cabinet members, parliamentary structures and so forth, I
                    didn't see that much interplay, in my work, between Norwegians and the
                    Swedes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the Helsinki Accords been signed at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Sure. The Accords were signed in '75.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. So, was it seen at that time that this was an
                        important thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Oh, definitely, yes. It was clear by this time that the Helsinki Accords
                    were going to have a very large, unexpected effect — unexpected at least by the
                    Soviets. The Accords turned into a lever to pry into the inner workings of
                    Soviet society through Basket III, which had to do with human rights and press
                    freedoms and things like that. It had a tremendous influence that was already
                    visible at this time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular issues that affected you or that
                        you got involved in between the United States and Sweden?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: The main one, which was, as I say, not conducted so much in public as in
                    private, had to do with issues related to the submarine incursions and in
                    general security issues having to do with the Soviet Union. That was kind of the
                    main basket of things. There was also the fact that Sweden was playing host to
                    arms control negotiations. There was flourishing trade between the U.S. and
                    Sweden. Relations, generally speaking, were constructive and moving pretty
                    smoothly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Swedish role in Africa? The Swedes,
                        particularly in East Africa, seem to have played a much broader role than
                        one might think.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>SILINS: That may be true, but it wasn't much of a bilateral issue when I was
                    there. One angle that interested me, because of my previous assignment in Haiti,
                    was the Swedish approach to foreign aid. As you may remember, the Swedes made
                    quite a point of the fact that they contributed a larger percentage of their
                    gross national product to foreign assistance than most countries. They had a
                    very active program through their aid agency, SIDA, and this was an area where
                    they would often compare themselves to us, with the U.S. having a relatively
                    small proportion of its GDP given to foreign aid. I was interested because
                    foreign aid is not easy to do. That is to say, it's not easy to help other
                    countries in an effective way. More money doesn't always mean more results, and
                    I could see that from Haiti, which turned out to be almost impossible to help.
                    And so I was interested to know if the Swedes had found some magic formula that
                    would work where others had failed. I'm not convinced that they had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. And of course one of the elements of foreign aid that
                        often is overlooked is that we have and always have had a very significant
                        amount of aid going through private and non-governmental organizations. That
                        doesn't often get into the statistics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: That's quite true. Most countries do not have as large a private
                    component to their foreign assistance as we do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, you left there in '86, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes, that's right, the summer of '86. But not before another Soviet-style
                    drama burst upon us. You may remember a certain Soviet nuclear reactor blew up
                    at the very end of that April. Well, the prevailing winds were toward the
                    northwest, and so Sweden became the first western country to detect and report
                    what we now know as the Chernobyl disaster. One of Sweden's own nuclear plants
                    was monitoring radiation levels, and at first they thought they had sprung a
                    serious leak themselves. I'm sure you also remember the appalling way the Soviet
                    government handled the tragedy, with lies, denials and delays that cost many
                    lives. If anyone needed final proof that the Soviet system was broken, Chernobyl
                    provided it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where'd you go then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Then I went to Harvard for a year as a fellow at CFIA, the Center for
                    International Affairs. It's now the Weatherhead Center. It was a foreign policy
                    oriented program at Harvard which invited some rather senior foreign officials,
                    many of them ambassadors or former ambassadors or members of government or
                    generals, to spend a year at Harvard. The State Department usually sent one
                    person and our military usually sent two.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>It was a fascinating year. There were only two requirements. You had to write a
                    paper and you were expected to participate in a weekly seminar, usually
                    featuring a guest speaker that one of the fellows rounded up. Other than that
                    you could do just about anything you wanted on the Harvard campus, including
                    auditing courses. And so I did a good deal of that, including sitting in on
                    courses and lectures at the Kennedy School.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How this was the CFIA program organized, did it have a
                        certain policy? What was it trying to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I think what the CFIA program was meant to do was bring reality to the
                    Harvard campus. That is to say, those who set it up, which included Robert Bowie
                    and Henry Kissinger, felt that Harvard's professors were too removed from world
                    affairs to have a realistic assessment of what was going on in the world. The
                    CFIA fellows program was intended to bring to campus people who had real-world
                    on-the-ground experience. That's why CFIA invited senior diplomats, government
                    officials and military officerfor example, there was an Israeli general in my
                    grouso that they could give the straight story to the professors and help them
                    to sharpen their understanding of how the world really works. For the State
                    Department and U.S. military participants, it was a good networking opportunity
                    and also a chance to work with some of the top scholars in fields they were
                    interested in.</p>
                <p>I confess I did something a bit mischievous. When it was my turn to arrange a
                    speaker for our weekly seminar, I invited Noam Chomsky. You probably know that
                    after he attained iconic status in philosophical linguistics, Chomsky became a
                    scathing critic of U.S. foreign policy. Since he was teaching right next door at
                    MIT, I thought, what the heck, let's have a change of pace. It certainly was.
                    Among other things, he called President Reagan a war criminal. After that
                    session, a catchphrase among our group of fellows became, “Who invited
                    Chomsky?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at Harvard around the beginning of the Gorbachev
                        phenomenon, weren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes. And because I knew I'd be going next to the State Department's
                    Soviet Desk, I wrote a paper on the Gorbachev reformtheir origins, what they
                    amounted to so far, and how we might be able to influence them. My research
                    showed that what Gorbachev was doing had much in common with a modernization
                    plan drafted by Andrei Sakharov and submitted to the Soviet leadership in 1970.
                    Gorbachev hadn't gone as far as Sakharov recommended a decade and a half
                    earlier, though.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've been in Leningrad and Sweden, you've watched the
                        demise of Brezhnev and Andropov and Chernenko and the appearance of
                        Gorbachev; how were you viewing this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>SILINS: With keen interest, and I'll tell you why. Not only because I would be
                    going to the Soviet Desk. I had an experience between Stockholm and Harvard in
                    1986 that really opened my eyes to what was going on in the Soviet Union in the
                    Gorbachev era. What happened was this.</p>
                <p>The year before, there had been a U.S.-Soviet, shall we say, informal
                    interaction, a meeting at Chautauqua, New York involving both government
                    officials and members of the public. I don't remember now who initiated this
                    series of Chautauqua meetings but they were in the spirit of the
                    people-to-people contacts that President Eisenhower is associated with. The
                    first U.S.-Soviet Chautauqua was held in '85 in the U.S. The idea was that they
                    would alternate between the Soviet Union and the United States, so in '86 it was
                    the Soviets' turn to host. And, as you mentioned, it was now the Gorbachev era,
                    so the Soviets were more open to this sort of interaction.</p>
                <p>They invited the American side to send a delegation to Latvia, to a town called
                    Jurmala on the Baltic coast, near Riga - for several reasons, one of them
                    mischievous. The overt reason was that Jurmala was the place most like
                    Chautauqua, New York that they could think of, in terms of a setting by the
                    water and general laid-back ambiance, in the Soviet Union. The mischievous
                    reason was that they knew, because we kept telling them this, that the United
                    States did not officially recognize the incorporation of Latvia and Estonia and
                    Lithuania into the Soviet Union. And so they probably thought, well, let's stick
                    it a little bit to the Americans. Will they actually have to refuse our
                    invitation? Indeed, we came pretty close to not going, because part of the
                    Baltic-American community got quite agitated at the prospect of what they
                    thought might be implicit recognition of the annexation of Latvia by a
                    delegation which was going to have very senior people in it, coming to such a
                    meeting.</p>
                <p>I was asked to go along in part to calm the Baltic-Americans, to show them, look,
                    it's going to be all right, a State Department officer of Baltic origin,
                    sensitive to your concerns, very familiar with Latvia and the Baltic States and
                    our non-recognition policy, will be on the scene. As I think I mentioned
                    earlier, when I was in Leningrad I made several visits to all of the Baltic
                    capitals and I was personally convinced that it was absolutely the right thing
                    to do, you had to maintain contacts instead of trying to freeze any sort of
                    interaction with these countries. I believed that if we refuse to go there, we
                    just make it very difficult for people who want to be in touch with the West to
                    do so. So, although there was a dramatic development that almost derailed the
                    1986 conference - the arrest by the Soviets of American reporter Nick Daniloff -
                    we were able to persuade the Baltic-American community that this was going to be
                    okay, it was not going to amount to implicit recognition.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>Indeed, the centerpiece American presentation at Jurmala was a talk by Jack
                    Matlock, who at that time had the Soviet portfolio at the National Security
                    Council. He became our ambassador to Moscow the next year. Matlock, in Russian
                    and phonetic Latvian and English, clearly stated U.S. non-recognition policy in
                    a way that was carried in Soviet media covering this conference. So it had a
                    strong impact way beyond what we could have hoped to do during the Brezhnev era,
                    when the U.S. had almost no direct access to the Soviet media. It was
                    fascinating to watch how things were changing.</p>
                <p>We came with a planeload of people that ranged from officials like Matlock and
                    Mark Palmer, who was also a Soviet expert, to outstanding private citizens like
                    Susan Eisenhower and Strobe Talbott, who was then Time's Soviet expert but
                    eventually became deputy secretary of state. There were musicians like Grover
                    Washington, an African-American jazz musician, and singer Karen Akers - all
                    kinds of people. It was an extremely talented and intelligent group. On the
                    flight over, I circulated a paper I had written, a capsule history of Latvia and
                    its perilous existence under Soviet occupation, to members of the delegation who
                    wanted to know more about the country we were about to visit.</p>
                <p>And our delegation contained young Latvian-Americans, all of them speakers of the
                    language. They included Ojars Kalnins, who later became Latvia's ambassador to
                    the U.S. - after giving up his American citizenship; and Nils Melngailis, who
                    became prominent in the Riga business community. This group came with little
                    lapel-pin flags, American and Latvian flags together, which they handed out.
                    This was actually more provocative than it sounds. The red-white-red striped
                    flag of Latvia was still illegal in the Soviet Union because it was a symbol of
                    independent Latvia. But lots of these were passed out.</p>
                <p>The official program focused on a series of speeches and dialogues at the
                    conference site, but more interesting really were the contacts outside the
                    auditorium. For example, the musicians would have jam sessions with local
                    musicians. As a sidebar, they got a candid picture of life for Latvians under
                    Soviet rule. After one of these accounts of oppression and discrimination,
                    Grover Washington commented, “Latvians are the Negroes of the Soviet Union!”</p>
                <p>Many of these events, including some of the unstructured meetings and talks on
                    the perimeter of the conference between our delegation and members of the crowd
                    that had flocked uninvited to the scene, were broadcast by local Latvian
                    television. This was absolutely stupefying and unprecedented at the time. And
                    the word spread to other parts of the USSR. So this event had, I'd say, a real
                    impact on the evolution of events in the whole Soviet Union, giving a measurable
                    push toward its breakup.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any feedback from Soviet types about
                        Gorbachev and where things are going? Was there a wariness or sort of a
                        delight or what was going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>SILINS: There were very mixed feelings - a feeling of great potential but great
                    uncertainty - in Latvia, in the Soviet Union and in Washington. You could feel
                    the lid being lifted off the Soviet pressure cooker but no one was sure what was
                    going to pop out or what Gorbachev's goal was. Probably including Gorby. Well, I
                    wasn't involved in the Washington debates when I was at Harvard. When I came to
                    the Soviet desk the following year, in the summer of '87, a consensus was
                    emerging that, whatever Gorby's intentions, his reforms were for real. Most
                    important, they offered a chance to transform our poisonous relationship with
                    the Soviets into something more constructive across the board, from arms control
                    to human rights. And that's what the Soviet desk worked flat-out to do. Despite
                    the fact that this was the Reagan presidency, forever identified with labeling
                    the Soviet Union the Evil Empire.</p>
                <p>Then came the 1988 election and the transition to the Bush Administration. At the
                    State Department, Jim Baker and his team took over from George Shultz. To our
                    surprise and dismay, most of our projects ground to a halt and there was, I
                    would say, a wasted six months while the new team went through an analysis of,
                    you know, is it really true that some sort of reform is taking place in the
                    Soviet Union or is this possibly a giant scam? It was, I thought, a really odd
                    transition. It was not like a transition from one Republican administration to
                    another but like one from, say, a Democratic to a Republican president, a
                    takeover by a group that obviously didn't trust the previous one, either its
                    policies or its personnel. And I hold this against Jim Baker to this day; he
                    wasted time, he weakened the institution of the State Department and he
                    conducted the transition like a hostile takeover.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. You know, in many ways it was odd. And was anybody
                        ... I know, with the Soviets you were trying to analyze what was going on
                        politically in the Soviet Union but were you getting any of those talents
                        turned to figure out what the hell was going on in the Reagan-Bush
                        changeover? I mean, politically, why was this happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>SILINS: Partly it was Jim Baker's style, partly it was that beyond Jim Baker
                    there were lots of conservative Republicans who simply could not believe that
                    the Soviet Union, which was their, you know, ultimate devil, could possibly be
                    transforming itself. They simply couldn't believe that it was genuine; they were
                    afraid that they were being tricked into something and so they were going to be
                    very, very careful to avoid that. And there's another element. I mean, even for
                    some of us who had no doubt whatsoever that something fundamental was going on,
                    you get used to working within a given context. We've all heard this. There are
                    many Cold Warriors who miss the structure that came with that period. It was
                    very clear then who the enemy was, and although it sounds like a bad thing, it
                    actually made it relatively easier to tell what you should do, how you should go
                    about things. Problems presented themselves in a crisper manner than they did
                    afterwards when the whole world seemed to be going to hell. So there was a
                    little bit of that, but a lot of it, I think, was Jim Baker, who came in with
                    his own small group to occupy all the positions of power. Of course Baker was
                    not unique in mistrusting the State Department. Lots of those who became
                    secretary of state did not trust the State Department. They thought we were
                    captives of the governments to which we were supposed to be representing U.S.
                    interests, they didn't realize how willing we are and how able we are to serve
                    whatever administration comes in. So there was a lot of wasted effort during
                    that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were on the Soviet desk from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: From the summer of '87 until roughly the summer of '89. The Shultz period
                    was really the Golden Age of the Soviet desk. Because of the importance Shultz
                    gave to U.S.-Soviet relations and the extent to which he personally became
                    engaged in them, he dealt directly with the Soviet desk. It was one of the few
                    times when a country desk had routine, sometimes daily, contact with the
                    secretary of state.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a feeling that Ronald Reagan was much of a
                        presence in the Soviet-American relationship?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Absolutely. It's easy to dismiss Reagan as an intellectual lightweight
                    but the reason that Reagan in many minds, and not just Republicans, is a great
                    president, although he certainly made some big mistakes like the Iran-Contra
                    thing, is that he had the ability to capture a spirit and to galvanize people
                    around a project. With respect to the Soviets he came within a hair's breath of
                    reaching global nuclear disarmament.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a side of Reagan that is often discounted.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>SILINS: Right. I mean, he was not afraid to do things that most others wouldn't
                    even dream of because it was just so far outside the box. So he had that
                    ability. He was not a stupid man. I think he had a very strong impact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, for one thing he wasn't a detail person but he
                        certainly did develop the theme, you might say.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Right. And he gave a lot of authority to Shultz who was, I think, one of
                    the most competent secretaries of state that we've had and was very much a
                    detail man and set up a very effective structure for dealing with Soviet issues,
                    with lots of teams that were in virtually a permanent negotiation to move things
                    forward.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived in, let's see, '87 on the Soviet desk,
                        there must have been a hell of a lot of internal debate on, you know, is
                        Gorbachev ... or, where is the Soviet Union going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, looking at it later, I don't think Gorbachev
                        knew where it was going but I mean, this is so different from what had been
                        going on for 40 years, 50 years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: That's very true. As I say, particularly in the early years, there was a
                    lot of suspicion that this wasn't all that it appeared and that it couldn't
                    possibly be going as far as it was.</p>
                <p>I had one advantage that I've mentioned, which was that I had been there to see
                    what was happening at the Chautauqua conference. I saw with my own eyes the
                    extent to which the media had been, at least in that setting, unleashed, the
                    extent to which people were being allowed to express their own views. And the
                    views that they were expressing were now also known to me personally. So I
                    wasn't nearly as likely to be paranoid about being duped. I came to the Soviet
                    Desk after that '86 experience much more convinced that Gorbachev was unleashing
                    forces that would cause significant reforms. To this day I believe, as you
                    suggested, that he didn't know where these forces were going to take his
                    country. He had no intention, I'm convinced, of causing the collapse of the
                    Soviet Union. He wanted to rejuvenate and strengthen it. But the buttons he knew
                    how to push were buttons that had already been pushed by Andropov. It was the
                    anti-drinking button and it was the economic acceleration button, and neither of
                    these were the solution. Then he opened that Pandora's Box of glasnost, letting
                    1,000 voices blossom, and that really began to pull things apart.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within the Soviet desk, was there a cadre of the old
                        Kremlinologists? Because I would imagine Kremlinology would not work very
                        well during the Gorbachev period. Maybe I'm wrong on that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: No, you're right. It used to be, as you know, that we would try to get a
                    lot of mileage out of seating charts at public events, see who was sitting next
                    to whom and that sort of thing. Now, this was mostly out of the window, although
                    not entirely, of course, because Gorbachev's own political position was not yet
                    totally secure. Indeed, as we saw, he came very close to being snuffed out by
                    leadership who opposed what he was doing or were afraid of the forces he had
                    unleashed.</p>
                <p>I should mention, though, that it wasn't all just a period of letting 1,000
                    flowers blossom vis-�-vis the Soviet Union. U.S.-Soviet relations were extremely
                    complicated at this time by the leftovers of the Cold War, the biggest one of
                    which was espionage. During this time we were dealing with the aftereffects of
                    the hyperactive espionage of both sides and I was thrust into it because part of
                    my brief on the Soviet desk was to deal with those kinds of issues, at least in
                    the administrative sense. I wasn't the technician or the security guy but, let's
                    say, the political management aspects of espionage were my thing.</p>
                <p>My title was Deputy Director for Bilateral Political Relations of the Office of
                    Soviet Union Affairs. Called Bilat, it was the biggest section because it
                    covered such a grab bag of issues - everything from internal Soviet political
                    relations to human rights to student exchanges to nationality questions to
                    various aspects of security and intelligence activities. And at this time we had
                    major espionage scandals. This was when we were discovering that both Embassy
                    Moscow and Consulate General Leningrad, where I had worked, were absolutely
                    infested with microphones and cameras. So that we could be sure that virtually
                    everything we said had been picked up by the KGB. We also were building a new
                    embassy in Moscow at this time and had just discovered that the very structure,
                    the very girders and beams of the building were penetrated with espionage
                    apparatus that we didn't understand. A whole industry was set up near the CIA
                    headquarters in McLean, Virginia, to try to figure out what the hell the Soviets
                    were up to. So we'd ship pieces of girders and steel back to cut apart and
                    analyze.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>We also had some defectors at this time. When a Soviet citizen defected to us,
                    the procedures were ritualized. We generally made him or her available promptly
                    to a representative of the Soviet embassy to show that the defection was
                    voluntary and not coerced. For example, I was positioned backstage at the
                    Kennedy Center during a performance by the visiting Kirov Ballet, just in case
                    any dancers decided to defect. They didn't, but it gave me an eye-opening view
                    of the athleticism of ballet, with dancers being massaged and rubbed down in the
                    wings like boxers between rounds. For the record, most ballerinas are as sinewy
                    as greyhounds up close. It was my job to do that kind of thing, as well as to
                    keep in touch with the FBI regarding counterintelligence. So all this was going
                    on at this time. Also, the Soviets were building a new embassy in Washington and
                    they had managed to procure a site at just about the highest point of the city
                    ...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right by the National Cathedral.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: ... just below the National Cathedral, overlooking the whole city, where
                    of course they had a line of sight for antennas and cameras on practically the
                    whole U.S. government. So all of this also was going on. It was a complex
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Soviet embassy? Were you seeing a
                        change, you might say, in the personnel or was it pretty much a pretty
                        disciplined KGB-type organization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, I would say that the Soviet embassy was not keeping pace with
                    Gorbachev in reforming itself, but it was clear on all sides, really, that the
                    situation was changing significantly and that if Gorbachev were to have his way
                    it would continue to change in the future and the important thing was for us to
                    not to overplay our hand but to encourage the process and to let it blossom.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the time when Reagan and Gorbachev met in Geneva,

                </p>
                <p>SILINS: There were a number of meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, was there concern among you all on the desk that
                        maybe the president's going to get too friendly with this guy and give away

                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>SILINS: Oh sure. There were certainly those who, first of all, were afraid that
                    Reagan simply didn't understand all the ins and outs of this complex
                    relationship. He might be a good poker-playing American but he couldn't deal
                    with the chess-playing Soviets and therefore would be snookered. Not very
                    different from the attitude of most staffers toward their superiors. Most
                    staffers are afraid that their superior's going to get off the reservation and
                    that's why we provide them with talking points and strategy papers and all the
                    rest of it. Reagan did have a tendency to go beyond those and I suggested, I
                    think, often that can be very fruitful. But sure, there were lots ... especially
                    those Republicans who thought that the whole thing was a fraud were very worried
                    that Reagan would be taken advantage of.</p>

                        because what the hell is this guy going to do, you know? I mean, he's too

                    after all, they're not private individuals; they're speaking for the country as

                <p>Who were some of the people you were working with on the desk? Would these people
                    later get involved in continuing Soviet affairs?</p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes, they did, and beyond that, too. At that time the Soviet desk had
                    some extremely talented people on it, as did the whole European bureau.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>The office director when I arrived on the scene was Mark Parris, a former
                    administrative officer who had turned into a brilliant all-around Foreign
                    Service officer. He went on to the NSC and then became ambassador to Turkey. His
                    deputy was John Evans, who later served as ambassador to Armenia. Mark Parris
                    was replaced by Sandy Vershbow, who went on to become ambassador to NATO, to
                    Russia and then to South Korea. Sandy's deputy was Larry Napper, who succeeded
                    me as ambassador to Latvia and went on to serve as ambassador to Kazakhstan.
                    Steve Pifer, the talented officer who handled arms control and other
                    multilateral issues, became ambassador to Ukraine. Nancy McEldowney, who also
                    worked on multilateral issues, became ambassador to Bulgaria. Victoria Nuland
                    went on to be ambassador to NATO. Directly above us on the sixth floor was
                    someone with whom we met every morning, Deputy Assistant Secretary Tom Simons.
                    Tom was Mark Parris' predecessor as director of Soviet affairs and he was now
                    overseeing the USSR and Eastern Europe. He went on to be ambassador to Poland
                    and to Pakistan.</p>
                <p>That's just a sampling. It was a high-octane team, able to work directly with the
                    secretary of state to take advantage of an unprecedented opening into the Soviet
                    Union through Gorbachev. I was lucky to be one of the dimmer stars in that
                    bright constellation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wouldn't have probably been in your area but were we
                        seeing, at this time, the Soviet empire beginning to collapse? I mean, there
                        are two elements; one, of course the Western bloc of Czechoslovakia, Poland
                        and all that, and the other one is internally the Stans and other republics.
                        Were we seeing any loosening there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Oh definitely. It was already clear there was something on the horizon.
                    It was initially no bigger than a man's hand but we felt it was going to turn
                    into a major storm. Remember that Reagan, when he was in Berlin in the summer of
                    1987, called on Gorbachev to “tear down this wall,” so there was already at the
                    highest level thinking that the fundamental structure of the Soviet empire was
                    subject to change. And as I say, while the Baltic States are small in
                    themselves, what I had seen in Latvia was a harbinger, a clear telltale that
                    something very big was striving to burst forth. And while most Baltic Americans
                    were hesitant to predict the immediate success of an independence movement
                    there, a minority was already calling for it and saying it was going to happen.
                    So yes, clearly something momentous was afoot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a feeling that time had moved on and with the
                        Helsinki Accords and change in the world and all, that the good old days of
                        running tanks into a country � l� Czechoslovakia or East Germany as a means
                        to control things were probably over?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>SILINS: Up to a point, yes. Up to a point. Once it was clear that the Soviets
                    were finished in Afghanistan, with the troop withdrawal beginning in the spring
                    of 1988 and completed the next year, that in itself was the big harbinger of
                    change. And it was clear from what he said and what he did that Gorbachev as
                    Soviet leader would be extremely reluctant to resort to force ... Although I
                    must say that in the Baltic States in 1990-91 Gorbachev at least passively
                    acquiesced in an abortive attempt to snuff out the uprisings there by Soviet
                    special forces, the OMON. But things had already changed dramatically all over
                    the map. For example, a country where I served previously, Romania, which had
                    been the home of one of the last Stalinists in Europe, Nicolae Ceausescu ...
                    Well, Ceausescu and his wife were snuffed out in the most brutal way, executed
                    by a firing squad, and you couldn't have a clearer signal that something big was
                    afoot. Of course, that wasn't until the end of 1989, on Christmas Day, in
                    fact.</p>
                <p>In the two years before that, when the trend was less clear, some of us on the
                    Soviet desk and at Embassy Moscow were already brooding about the possible blind
                    alley that Gorby's reforms might be heading into. And we can be sure that
                    conservatives and reactionaries in the Communist Party were, too. It had to do
                    with the seeming incompatibility of democracy with the way Russia had always
                    been ruled, except for that brief interlude just before the Bolsheviks seized
                    power. And the notion of a democratic Soviet Union seemed a contradiction to
                    those who knew - as Gorbachev perhaps did not, given his na�ve idea that that
                    Baltic States would willingly become a sort of test bed for Soviet economic
                    reforms - that without the threat of force, the thirst for independence would
                    tear many of the constituent republics away from Mother Russia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a concern, although it wasn't in your bailiwick,
                        that maybe Germany might all of a sudden end up as a united neutral country?
                        Because this was one of the nightmares, I think, as people looked upon the
                        European situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes. That was of course a fundamental issue but not one I was personally
                    wrestling with on the Soviet desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Getting back to the espionage thing, was anybody trying to
                        tell both the KGB and the CIA, for God's sakes, knock it off, fellas, or
                        calm it down? Or were they almost free agents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, I don't think they're free agents. Mostly they were carrying out
                    government policy, although of course working in hyper-secrecy does rather
                    invite rogue adventures. I think the root problem is a temptation on the part of
                    government officials to regard illicitly obtained information as somehow more
                    valuable than what is learned through open sources. It's a keyhole-peeping
                    mentality and it's unfortunately found in most countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>I have spent a fair amount of time in positions, beginning with my very first one
                    in Saigon, with access to very sensitive classified information. You know,
                    so-called codeword information. At that first job it was because I was the aide
                    to the ambassador. The Executive Secretariat, the Romanian desk and the Soviet
                    desk also brought their own access. From what I have seen, this stuff is often
                    overrated. And very often what we lose in the acquisition through the blowback
                    from the way we got it, which tends to breed, at a minimum, mistrust of our
                    activities, is greater than what we actually gain from the information. In other
                    words, there is a net loss to the national interest through the trouble and cost
                    of getting the information compared to the benefit of having it. Naturally there
                    are dramatic exceptions. In war, of course, good intelligence is absolutely
                    essential and can be decisive. But when you turn illicit information-gathering
                    into a routine peacetime activity that is habitually and aggressively exercised
                    from your diplomatic platforms, from your embassies and other places that fall
                    under your flag, I think the costs are often greater than the gains. And I think
                    we need to rein it in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I agree with you completely; I've had the same experience,
                        I think most of us have. There's an interesting book, I have it on the table
                        there, “Legacy ...”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I know it, I have it also. It's a sad tale.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...”of Ashes.” I didn't know it was being written but when
                        I got the book, I'm quoted in there, one of my oral histories, but I found
                        that the man had used, I think it's '77, our oral histories, in documenting
                        the darker, less effective side of CIA operations. Because there is, as you
                        mentioned, the blowback. I mean, when you do these things it sounds great,
                        in wartime you don't really give a damn, but in peacetime you have to
                        consider the consequences.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, you have to consider the consequences even in wartime. When it
                    comes to acquiring information in wartime one thing you should not do, for
                    example, is torture, which is a kind of espionage; that is, illicitly obtained
                    information. You may think at the time that the returns will justify it, but the
                    long-term impact is horrendous because it means that your own people are more
                    likely to be treated in the same way. And of course it elicits hate and a thirst
                    for revenge, so it multiplies your enemies.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>The Foreign Service has not found a credible voice in addressing the questions of
                    intelligence collection and covert action. I think we feel inhibited in doing so
                    and I'm not quite sure what the answer is. The mere fact that you're talking
                    about classified matters is in itself a great inhibition, of course. There is
                    also the fear of seeming na�ve or weak if you argue for trimming back the
                    intelligence services, just as when you call for military cutbacks. We may have
                    to wait for a secretary of state who understands the issue well enough to speak
                    at cabinet level in a way that will swing back the balance. Just in terms of
                    resources, the amount of money and human talent that is dedicated to
                    intelligence is so much greater than what is devoted to traditional diplomacy
                    that I think it has to be reined in. Our country is not being well served.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Most of the so-called human intelligence is intelligence
                        that's bought, that's paid for. And if you pay for something, that
                        immediately taints the information because obviously there's a profit motive
                        in producing it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Right, an inherent conflict of interest. If you pay somebody for
                    information, that person, in order to get more money, will come up with more
                    information. He'll try to figure out what kind of information you want and may
                    fabricate it. And that's been documented year after year.</p>
                <p>By the way, during the two years I spent on the Soviet desk the intelligence
                    community seemed to be stepping up attempts to harness the Foreign Service as
                    part of its collection apparatus. Mostly a holdover of Cold War thinking, I
                    guess, but it was also motivated by the revelations of Soviet intelligence
                    penetration that were surfacing. The idea was to coordinate the State
                    Department's diplomatic information-gathering efforts with the
                    intelligence-collection activities of our covert services so that the two would
                    reinforce each other through an integrated collection plan. Sounds reasonable,
                    on the surface. But it creates a pressure to push diplomats into doing things
                    that, at a minimum, would be considered violations of privacy, or worse. And
                    that reduces their access and effectiveness because, let's face it, most of the
                    truth is going to leak out sooner or later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, when you left ... The question I always ask of
                        somebody who moved jobs in the summer of '89, where did you think things
                        were going? I mean, did you see something happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>SILINS: Yes, I definitely saw something happening. I did not at that time expect
                    that the Baltic States would be independent within a couple of years. I guess I
                    tend to be more of an incrementalist in projecting the future than I should be.
                    It's hard to apply the concept of “tipping points” to foreign policy. I was sure
                    that change was coming all through Eastern Europe and the Baltic States; no
                    question about that at all. But the pace of it overtook me. I did not expect
                    Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania so quickly to become “Three Mice that Roared” and
                    helped topple the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>After the Soviet Desk I went to Strasbourg as consul general. It was interesting
                    because Strasbourg was also the headquarters of the Council of Europe. Not to be
                    confused with the European Parliament, the Council of Europe was a collection of
                    European nations that predates the European Union. It had already become the
                    site of an important meeting between Gorbachev and European leadership. He had
                    been invited to address a session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council
                    of Europe. It was clear that the Council of Europe wanted to play a role in
                    healing the rift in Europe caused by the Iron Curtain. So I saw that my job in
                    Strasbourg would keep me in touch with this historic development, the
                    reintegration of Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you went out, we're still talking about leading up
                        to the summer of '89... I take it you maintained some contact with some of
                        the Baltic groups in the United States. Did you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I was not very active in the Baltic-American community or the
                    Latvian-American community. I was one of those immigrant children who early on
                    decided that, by God, I was very lucky to be in America and that's where I was
                    going to hang my hat. And so only because my mother pretty much forced me to did
                    I keep up my knowledge of the Latvian language. I bless her for it but it was
                    not my natural inclination.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I was wondering whether from anywhere, not
                        necessarily from your own personal contacts but whatever contact you had,
                        was there growing excitement within the Baltic community in the States? Was
                        there seen to be any change in the future?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>SILINS: Yes, there was. But there was still a shadow of the debate I mentioned in
                    connection with the Chautauqua conference, about the extent to which we in the
                    West should maintain contact with people in the Baltic States. That is, the
                    extent to which we should welcome visitors from there and the extent to which we
                    should go there ourselves. During the Cold War period we knew that any
                    delegation from the Baltic States to the U.S. had at least one KGB watchdog and
                    often more than that. Likewise, contacts in the Baltic States by Americans often
                    were either monitored by the KGB, or at a minimum people with whom we had
                    contact were questioned afterwards by the KGB. So there was this dilemma of
                    whether we should collaborate in some sense in this KGB activity or not. I was
                    always on the side of those who said yes, it's a bad thing, we try to work
                    around the KGB when we can, but you can't let this be an excuse for simply
                    cutting off all contacts. Not everyone in the U.S. agreed with that, not
                    everyone in the Baltic-American community. Just as, to take an especially sad
                    case, many in the Cuban-American community have long been for a rock-hard, and I
                    think futile, policy of trying to isolate Castro, which has been notably
                    unsuccessful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Played right into his hands.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, in Strasbourg... It was the European Union when
                        you went there, or was it still the European Community?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: First of all, the organization that I was to work with was not the
                    European Community, as it was called then, but the Council of Europe. And the
                    parliamentary body I would be in touch with was not the European Parliament,
                    which was the legislative side of the European Community, but the
                    similar-sounding Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. But the
                    similarities and seeming overlap of the two organizations and their sub-units
                    quickly lead to eye-watering confusion!</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>Only a handful of specialists had any idea what the Council of Europe was. It was
                    not the European Community; it's a separate organization. And it had a larger
                    membership - more countries - than what is now called the European Union. It's
                    more inclusive but it doesn't assert, as the European Union does, supranational
                    rights over its members. It operates on the basis of conventions, treaties and
                    agreements covering important areas. Some of these are technical, such as
                    standards for pharmaceutical products, but they include the fight against
                    terrorism and human rights. It is the overseer of the European Convention on
                    Human Rights and it hosts the European Human Rights Court. As the former Warsaw
                    Pact countries and eventually Russia joined the Council of Europe and accepted
                    its requirements, the Human Rights Court and the Convention exerted positive,
                    even decisive influence on the reform of their legal systems. So the Council of
                    Europe does critically important things, but even in the State Department maybe
                    only three or four people had any idea of what it was and how it was different
                    from the European Community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in its inclusivity, did it include Turkey?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes, it did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the background of the formation of this
                        organization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: It goes back to the dream of a united states of Europe that Churchill
                    called for in 1946. Unlike the organization that eventually became the European
                    Union, the Council of Europe proceeded on the fast track without taking on the
                    economic portfolio. It developed in breadth rather than depth, shall we say, and
                    focused on things like harmonizing legislation and providing a political forum
                    in which to debate issues, with a focus on rule of law and human rights. On the
                    other track was the European Coal and Steel Community, which really got down to
                    the nitty-gritty, that is, how some of the economic assets of the continent were
                    going to be managed. And that's the one that led to the European Union, which
                    acquired the clout and the money and is the one we mostly talk about today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the delegates run for office, or how are they
                        selected?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: The delegates to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe are
                    chosen from their own parliaments. In other words, they're already elected to
                    the parliaments of their own countries and are sent periodically to represent
                    that country in Strasbourg.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Strasbourg from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>SILINS: Well, I was there from '89 to, let's see, '91. The reason I hesitate is
                    that I didn't complete my assignment to Strasbourg. I was asked in the fall of
                    '91 to set up a new embassy in Riga.</p>
                <p>Even before that, and I forget the exact date, in Strasbourg I got a phone call
                    from the State Department asking if I would be interested in going to a Baltic
                    capital, presumably Riga, although the location was still a little up in the
                    air, to set up something that would be like a consulate general but that would
                    represent the U.S. to all three Baltic States. Already back in Washington people
                    were thinking the Baltic States might change their status. At the time we were
                    represented to them only through Leningrad, a city in the USSR. Wouldn't it be
                    nice to have representation in one of their capitals, separate from the
                    consulate general in Leningrad? That would reinforce our policy of not
                    recognizing their incorporation into the USSR. I said, yes, I would be
                    interested, but how are you going to do this? The answer was, we plan to ask for
                    Soviet permission to set up such a mission. I knew right away that the idea
                    wasn't likely to fly. I mention it only because it does show that the thinking
                    about the transformation of the USSR was beginning to evolve. The Swedes did set
                    up such a consular mission in Riga and got a jump on the rest of the diplomatic
                    community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's go back to the Council of Europe and all. What
                        sort of a player was this in European unity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I think it was an important player in the early stages of grooming the
                    former Soviet satellites for reintegration into Western Europe. They also
                    reached out to Gorbachev, as I said. The East European countries that had been
                    part of the Soviet bloc were invited to send guest delegations to Strasbourg and
                    launch the process of becoming full fledged members of the Council of Europe. In
                    doing so, the Council of Europe imposed requirements on them, including human
                    rights and rule of law requirements that had an impact on how these countries
                    evolved internally, because they could see now that they had to jump through
                    certain hoops in order to be accepted back into Western Europe, which is where
                    they wanted to be. So I would rate it as being quite important on the European
                    stage, particularly with respect to harmonizing legislation and with the
                    highlight on human rights issues, but as having almost no discernible impact in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that there was an EU mafia that tended to be
                        dismissive of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>SILINS: Well, to some extent. They simply couldn't hold that many things in their
                    minds at the same time. The European Community did exist, we knew it was
                    important—God knows I would never deny that—and the Council of Europe looked
                    like excess baggage that no one had much use for. So they gave me pretty much
                    free rein to do what I wanted there. Considering how little the State Department
                    cared, I was treated with amazing respect and consideration by the various
                    officials in Strasbourg, as the equivalent of an ambassador from a member
                    country. But the U.S. at that time was not only not a member country, we did not
                    even have “official” observer status. We were simply represented by our consul
                    general in Strasbourg.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was the, well later it was the European Union but I
                        guess your European Council, where was its parliament located?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, here's just one of the many sources of confusion. The parliament of
                    the Council of Europe met in Strasbourg. But so did the parliament of the
                    European Community - part of the time. That's what we call the European
                    Parliament. It would move back and forth. Half the time, it met in Strasbourg in
                    the same building as the parliament of the Council of Europe until it eventually
                    acquired its own building nearby.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, you're confusing me.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I apologize, but this is just the beginning. The European Parliament
                    would commute back and forth, at great expense, between Brussels and Strasbourg.
                    For good measure, it also had administrative offices in Luxembourg. The
                    commuting was largely at the insistence of France, which demanded equal time for
                    Strasbourg. For further eye-blurring confusion, we could talk about why the
                    similar-sounding Council of Europe, the European Council, and the Council of the
                    European Union are really three different institutions. But perhaps we should go
                    on to something else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find Strasbourg important as a listening
                        post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Very much so. You know, that's what really made it for me. I mentioned
                    that the former Soviet satellite countries were sending delegations to
                    Strasbourg and preparing for full membership. So it was a good place to meet
                    parliamentary and government officials from all over Europe and keep tabs on the
                    dawning of the post-Soviet era. Among the delegations with which I met was one
                    that included the soon-to-be foreign minister of independent Latvia.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>Now, I was slightly schizophrenic officially because part of my job was to
                    represent U.S. interests in east-central France. In fact, it was a particularly
                    pleasant part of my job. That part of France, Alsace-Lorraine, that whole corner
                    of France, happens to be unusually pro-American. They just love the United
                    States. That's where the design for the Statue of Liberty came from. They
                    thought Americans were wonderful, the Americans came over to save them from the
                    Germans, and they will go out of their way to be nice to us. And in fact they,
                    that is, those French citizens living there, prevented the State Department from
                    closing the Strasbourg consulate as part of its many and frequent attempts to
                    trim its budget. The State Department had put Strasbourg on the hit list, but a
                    delegation headed, I believe, by the mayor of Strasbourg went to Washington and
                    lobbied - not the State Department, they're not that dumb, they went straight to
                    the Congress. They told the Congress that this was a really bad idea, it would
                    give the U.S. a black eye in France and don't do it. So Congress removed
                    Strasbourg from the hit list.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the French-German equation work out there? Now,
                        this is some years, obviously, after the war, but how was this playing with
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I didn't notice any French-German tension. The local blend of French and
                    German culture, cuisine and architecture seems to have settled into a very
                    stable and attractive mix. It's a captivating part of France. There are still a
                    lot of residents with German surnames and a local dialect survives that is
                    basically a kind of German. At the same time, because of tourism and the fact
                    that the Council of Europe, the European Parliament and their sister
                    institutions regularly bring so many foreign officials to town, it also has a
                    very international flavor. The French lean over backwards to maintain the French
                    imprint, which is one reason, I think, why they absolutely insisted that the
                    European Parliament meet there as well as in Brussels. But as far as tension
                    between French and Germans, I never saw any of that. The Rhine flows right by
                    Strasbourg, as you know, and there was busy traffic back and forth all the time.
                    You could do that without having to present passports or documents and it was
                    very free in both directions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the fall of the Berlin Wall, how did all that play
                        when you heard about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: That whole period just before and after the fall of the wall and the Iron
                    Curtain was just fascinating. Of course everyone in Europe was just agog about
                    it. My own favorite memory is when my wife and I were on a weekend trip with our
                    son Nico into the mountains not far from the German border and we saw these ...
                    You've heard of the German car, the Trabant, which is basically a lawnmower with
                    a car body? These little vehicles, looking timid and vulnerable, were just
                    beginning to penetrate to the West. They were sort of tentatively and haltingly
                    making their way, you know, because they had never, ever been allowed to go
                    across the border and now they were making their first adventurous penetrations
                    into Western Europe. It remains a touching image for me.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>I also saw the dramatic physical difference that the fall of the Berlin Wall
                    made. We visited Berlin, oh, roughly six months after the wall had come down. In
                    some places the wall had been literally erased, taken away stone by stone. It
                    was just gone. But what was not gone was the jarring and now inexplicable
                    difference in the buildings on one side and the other of where the wall had
                    stood; one side gray and tumbling down and in bad shape, the other side modern
                    and flourishing. It was bizarre and very, very striking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this send any shockwaves through the Council of Europe
                        or did their activity change?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Their activity accelerated. I mentioned they had already been preparing
                    for this. They were going to be, shall we say, the first port of call in Western
                    Europe for government and parliamentary delegations from what had been
                    previously part of the Soviet bloc. So they had already laid the groundwork.
                    They had invited representatives to come to Strasbourg even before these
                    countries were truly independent. They were not surprised, they were happy about
                    the new opening, and they redoubled their efforts to show them how to bring
                    their political systems, legislation and courts into harmony with Europe. The
                    next step, of course, would be to pass them on to the big brother, the European
                    Community, later the European Union, which would further integrate them into
                    Europe.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any flavor of immigration to France from
                        North Africa or had this really picked up by that time? Because, you know,
                        today it's a real problem for the French.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: It was already a problem then. Even back then something was taking place
                    that to this day I find absolutely stupefying that it's so routine in France,
                    and that is the burning of cars as a means of public expression. This was
                    already happening from time to time, actually, in Strasbourg. Groups mostly of
                    North Africans would, for whatever reason, have a mini-riot and set fire to
                    cars. And as we've seen, this has continued over the years and in Paris
                    sometimes reaches massive proportions. It was already a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see the French in the Strasbourg area trying to do
                        anything about integration of these North Africans, and Africans, I guess
                        too, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>SILINS: They weren't very successful at it. Part of the difficulty is that there
                    is a sense in which the French simply pretend that the problem doesn't exist.
                    That is, there's a great reluctance to do anything that we would call
                    affirmative action because that would seem to imply that there are alternative
                    civilizations within France, and they will not accept that. You are either
                    French or you're not French and by God, if you're in France you're going to be
                    French. And this may have acted as a brake on their ability to integrate people,
                    at least those who are not inclined to integrate themselves. There are, of
                    course, a lot of people of North African and Middle East background in France
                    who threw themselves wholeheartedly into French culture. I remember being
                    terribly amused one day; I was at the U.S. embassy in Paris, I was cashing a
                    check, and the cashier was very obviously Lebanese. And she started complaining
                    to me about how wasn't it a shame there were so many foreigners now in Paris,
                    obviously thinking of herself as Parisian - that is, French. So she had just
                    melted into that mentality. I sympathize; in a way I did that with the American
                    mentality except it's not quite the same thing. Americans can also be something
                    else; a French person is not really allowed to also be something else. There are
                    not hyphenated Frenchmen, at least not yet.</p>

                    Europe and what it was doing about the reintegration of Europe. I think I
                    mentioned that I had been asked if I'd be interested in setting up a consulate
                    in Riga to cover the Baltic States, but that never really took root.</p>

                    happen.</p>

                <p>SILINS: Right. But then, not so long ... Well, there was one other interesting

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Excuse me; what date are we talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: We're now in the winter of '90 - '91. The Soviet Union is undergoing
                    great transformation. Gorbachev has set in motion a process that he ultimately
                    will not be able to control; it's not clear where it's going but it's clear that
                    a big change is coming. One of the catalysts of that change was what's now
                    called the OSCE (the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe), then
                    known as the CSCE. In November 1990 here was going to be a CSCE summit in Paris,
                    which would also include East European representatives, and among them were
                    going to be, for the first time, representatives of the Baltic States. I went to
                    Paris to see this event take place and was actually rather horrified at what
                    happened.</p>
                <p>The chairman of the summit, because he was the president of the host country, was
                    Fran�ois Mitterrand, and he therefore had the final word on how the procedures
                    would evolve. Agreement had been reached before the conference that
                    representatives of the Baltic States, which were at that point far from
                    independent, were going to be allowed into the hall and would be seated as
                    officially recognized representatives. At the last moment, and this happened
                    before I actually reached Paris because I'd been delayed for some reason,
                    possibly a snowstorm, about the time I was getting there what happened was this.
                    The top leaders were seated at the front of the large room with Gorbachev next
                    to Mitterrand. As Gorbachev looked out across the hall, he could see that there
                    were representatives of the Baltic States. And he leaned over to Mitterrand and
                    said, more or less, either they go or I go. I don't know precisely what he said,
                    but essentially it was, either they're out of here or I am, and Mitterrand
                    immediately caved in and had the Baltic delegations removed from the room.</p>
                <p>I found that shocking, frankly, and disappointing. As did the evicted Baltic
                    delegates, of course. As I say, their seating had already been negotiated in
                    advance, and so Gorbachev was reneging on something that had already been
                    decided. This episode suggested that when push came to shove, if the Russians
                    said, we really are angry about something and we want it done this way, the CSCE
                    would cave in. It caused CSCE stock to drop considerably in the Baltic
                    States.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>I mention the episode because it did continue to color my views of that
                    organization during my time as ambassador to Latvia. I hasten to add that
                    overall my view of the CSCE is favorable. I think it played a very positive role
                    in helping to catalyze the internal transformation of the Soviet empire because
                    of its Basket III, which opened a window for the West to encourage independent
                    groups, human rights groups, some of which became very nationalist groups, that
                    helped to bring about the transformation, indeed the collapse, of the Soviet
                    empire. Its work certainly gave courage to the dissidents in the early
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to get a feel for the time, I mean, obviously the
                        United States was sort of unique in that we had never recognized the Soviet
                        swallowing of the Baltic States. This goes back to the ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: World War II.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: World War II. But what about other countries, the European
                        countries? How stood they on this issue? Let's bring it up to '89.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: There was a lot of variation in the degree to which they resisted
                    recognizing the incorporation of the Baltic States. The majority of them did not
                    officially recognize it. That is, they did not recognize it de jure but almost
                    everybody recognized it de facto, as a fait accompli. They treated the property
                    of the formerly independent Baltic States, for example their diplomatic
                    missions, as now essentially the property of the Soviet Union. This became an
                    issue after the Baltic States regained their independence, because of course
                    they tried to regain possession of their former buildings in order to set up new
                    embassies.</p>
                <p>We were the leader of the pack on Baltic policy in the West. If we had, as we
                    were sometimes tempted to do... if we had decided that non-recognition policy
                    was outdated and going to lead nowhere, I think it would have collapsed
                    globally, and everyone would both de facto and de jure have recognized the
                    incorporation of the Baltic States. So really the Baltic States owe their
                    independence to a considerable extent to the steadiness of American policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, particularly, the French and Germans and
                        British? Had they put any qualifications on how they stood with these states
                        or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>SILINS: Of those three, the Germans of course were the ones most intimately
                    involved in the Baltic area, but in a way of which they could not be proud. And
                    that's because Hitler had sold, literally sold the Baltic States to the Soviet
                    Union. That was the purpose of the secret annex to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact
                    of August 1939, where for sums of money, of gold, territory was ceded by the
                    Germans, who controlled it, to the Russians. Many people see that as a
                    precipitating cause of the Second World War; it secured Germany's eastern flank
                    and allowed Hitler to attack Poland and then launch his western campaign. So the
                    Germans were not ... They felt they didn't have the moral standing, shall we
                    say, to take the lead in disputing the Soviet annexation. An awkward situation
                    for them, so they tended to stay in the background on this issue.</p>
                <p>The Brits were more solid, more in line with American policy. The French were
                    more pragmatic in adapting their policy to other interests, so they were pretty
                    strong de facto recognizers of the annexation of the Baltic States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: None of the major powers had completely bowed to the
                        Soviet Union. I mean, there was always sort of a qualification there, would
                        you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: That's quite true. As I say, because of American steadfastness we did not
                    recognize it and so they fell into line. While the Western powers did not try to
                    violate Soviet rules on contacts with the Baltic States, the policy of
                    non-recognition preserved the possibility, I mean the reality, that the Baltic
                    States were in a different category from the other republics of the Soviet
                    Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Swedes or Finns have any role in this at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I think I touched on this previously, in the context of my time at the
                    embassy in Stockholm. The Swedes assumed a disappointingly low profile on this
                    subject despite the fact that Olof Palme, who was prime minister, had a strong
                    personal Baltic connection. His mother was a Baltic German and I understand that
                    he used to spend summers in Latvia as a boy. Perhaps because of the intensity of
                    Swedish opposition to U.S. policy in Vietnam, the Swedes leaned toward the
                    notion that, well, maybe Soviet policy isn't all that attractive, but look, the
                    Americans are just as unattractive and therefore we're not going to be crusaders
                    against the Soviet Union on behalf of something the Americans support. In
                    retrospect, though, my feeling is that the main motivation was pragmatic. The
                    USSR was a powerful neighbor, bristling with arms and with a demonstrated
                    readiness to impose its views by force. Knowing how strongly Moscow felt about
                    holding on to the Baltic States, Sweden was willing to let that issue lie. So
                    pragmatic considerations trumped principle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, at this CSCE conference, what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>SILINS: I had no official role or status. I went up to Paris because of my own
                    interest in Baltic issues, because Baltic representatives for the first time
                    were to be allowed into a high-level CSCE meeting. It was not unusual for me to
                    go to Paris from Strasbourg; I did that all the time. But I had no official
                    role; I went up there because I wanted to talk to some of the Baltic
                    representatives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had experience looking at it both from Leningrad and
                        Stockholm. Were you able to talk to the Baltic representatives there, and
                        what were you seeing? Were they on their way, was this your feeling, or was
                        the role of the Soviets so problematic that it was dubious?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: The independence of the Baltic States was still up in the air. Even
                    today, any person with knowledge of Baltic history realizes that nothing is for
                    sure in that area. On the one hand, Baltic residents felt that momentum toward
                    independence was accelerating. But from the Soviet point of view ... Gorbachev
                    at this time apparently still believed that the Baltic States could be a sort of
                    laboratory for testing ideas to rejuvenate the Soviet Union. I think that's how
                    he thought of them, as a valuable part of the USSR. Because of their past
                    history and ties with the West, because of their small size, because of their
                    reputation for a high degree of education and industrial productivity, they
                    could be used as a test bed to experiment with techniques that might then be
                    expanded on a broader scale to rejuvenate the entire Soviet Union. He entirely
                    missed, misunderstood, failed to grasp, the strength of national feeling in the
                    Baltic States. Maybe even today he's still puzzled about why the Balts show so
                    little gratitude for what the Soviets tried to do for them. That point of view
                    is shared by a lot of Russians who, to this day, regard the Balts as ungrateful
                    pests who during the Soviet era enjoyed a standard of living higher than the
                    average for the USSR. Many Russians apparently are convinced that the Balts
                    benefited from their relationship with the Soviet Union. They cannot imagine
                    that from the Baltic perspective their half century inside the USSR was a long,
                    painful period when economic, political and social development was smothered by
                    the Russian occupation. Many Balts feel confident that if they had remained
                    independent, their economies would have kept pace with, say, those of Denmark or
                    Finland or Sweden. Instead, upon finally regaining their independence, they
                    found themselves far poorer than any EU members.</p>

                <p>SILINS: In the fall of '91, Bob Frasure, Darryl Johnson and I assembled in

                    establishment of diplomatic missions in Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. The
                    United States had formally recognized them as independent countries at the
                    beginning of September 1991. Our mission was going to be to open up embassies in
                    Tallinn, Vilnius and Riga. Bob went to Tallinn, Darryl to Vilnius and I went to
                    Riga. We went first on a TDY (temporary duty) basis, and then were designated as
                    charg�s in early October.</p>
                <p>Our first job was to find locations for these new embassies.... Well, that's not
                    quite accurate. Our principal goal was to establish a diplomatic beachhead and
                    begin to help these fragile new governments cope with the scary set of economic,
                    political and security problems that faced them. But simply putting together the
                    rudiments of a diplomatic mission absorbed much of our energy in the first
                    weeks. In Riga, I led a small group of officers, sent on a TDY basis from the
                    State Department, operating out of the fifth floor of a small downtown hotel,
                    the Ridzene. Our communication with Washington was by the Inmarsat system, with
                    a satellite dish set up on a window ledge. I slept in a room down the hall. So
                    the U.S. embassy was at first a hotel room, and pretty much the same thing
                    happened in the other two Baltic capitals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What had happened at this point when you were there? I
                        mean, what was the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: We reached this point only after the U.S. Government recognized Baltic
                    independence and opened diplomatic relations with Baltic countries. We were far
                    from the first to do so; Iceland was the first. We were way down the line, I
                    forget the exact number, something like 27th, 30th or something. The reason for
                    that was the policy of President Bush, that is, the elder George Bush, his
                    policy of prudence vis-�-vis the Soviet Union. I think I've mentioned this in a
                    previous context. He did not wish to move so rapidly into this very sensitive
                    part of the former Soviet Union as to provoke a Soviet counter-reaction. He
                    wanted to move slowly and carefully so as not to jeopardize Baltic independence
                    or Soviet stability. That's why we didn't rush in to be the first to recognize.
                    Our slow pace was held against us, and maybe to this day still is, by some
                    Baltic citizens, but I think it was a wise and certainly a defensible
                    policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is to avoid what they call triumphalism.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it makes sense. Besides, we didn't really have to
                        because we already had Riga.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Right.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know. So I mean, this is, you know, just straightening
                        the deck chairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, that calls up the image of the Titanic. Let's not go down that
                    road.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're right. But anyway ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Right. No, that's quite true. We knew that, as I said, we were
                    responsible for holding open the possibility of independence for the Baltic
                    States over all these decades. So, no reason to shout about it. We just wanted
                    to go in there and get the job done... and there was, of course, a lot to get
                    done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, you were given Latvia, is that...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a joint effort where the three teams were doing
                        it all together, or did you each go to a place and do your work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: We met initially to coordinate the basic policy and organize the
                    practical work, decide how we would communicate with the State Department, whom
                    we would report to. Our first job was simply the physical task, the
                    administrative task of setting up these facilities, of establishing a place to
                    work, assigning responsibilities and getting this job done. We operated
                    separately from each other but we met periodically, typically in a Nordic
                    capital and then on a rotational basis in Riga, Tallinn and Vilnius once our
                    embassies were functioning. The idea was to share experiences, share ideas -
                    what worked, what didn't work - because we were basically all operating to the
                    same, dare I say, cookie cutter mold as far as actually setting up the embassy
                    went. And here you probably sense a beef coming.</p>
                <p>At this time James Baker was secretary of state and he had apparently decided
                    that he was going to open all these new embassies - and I'm talking about not
                    just the three Baltic States but also the many former Soviet republics that
                    quickly peeled off from Mother Russia - without any new money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's one of those horrible mistakes. I mean, it sounded
                        like sort of a political gimmick with no real value at all outside of
                        ...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>SILINS: Well, it caused a lot of stress. I think it was silly and irresponsible.
                    We could have redistributed funds from some other government agencies that had
                    an excess, for example the Department of Defense. After all, the Cold War was
                    now more or less over and you might think there would be a peace dividend, but
                    for some reason Baker essentially said, well, we'll just open... whatever it
                    came to, something over a dozen new embassies... without any new funding. And it
                    caused staffing shortages. For example, Embassy Riga never had a general
                    services officer during my time as ambassador, which in retrospect I find
                    hilarious. To actually, you know, to start off in a hotel and be looking for a
                    building and then reconfigure a building into an embassy, starting absolutely
                    from scratch and having to select, hire and train local staff without a GSO was
                    just ludicrous. I also didn't have a permanent administrative officer much of
                    the time, so I was dependent on temporary officers, TDYers, which of course
                    caused problems of continuity. So I had to devote more time than I could spare
                    to overseeing the administrative activities of getting an embassy located,
                    renovated, staffed up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation on the ground where you were
                        working?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: The situation in late 1990 and early 1991 had been turbulent and
                    threatening. When we arrived in September 1991 there were still barricades in
                    downtown Riga left over from that period, when there had been a sort of abortive
                    coup attempt. Lots of Russians were appalled at the idea of Russia losing the
                    Baltic States. Within the USSR itself there was a conservative backlash against
                    the direction Gorbachev was taking, and in late 1990 there were rumors there
                    might be a coup in Russia followed by a dictatorship. In fact, Soviet Foreign
                    Minister Shevardnadze resigned in December 1990, warning that “dictatorship is
                    coming.” A right-wing coup in Moscow would almost certainly have led sooner or
                    later to an attempt to seize back Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The skeleton of
                    an alternative Soviet-loyalist government - a “Committee of National Salvation”
                    - had been formed in Latvia, and in January of '91 Soviet special forces, the
                    OMON, were briefly unleashed. There was some gunfire in downtown Riga. One of
                    their targets was the Latvian interior ministry building, which is across a
                    narrow street from the Hotel Ridzene, which became the U.S. Embassy. Some people
                    were shot in the park across the street. There was also shooting inside the
                    hotel itself. Jim Kenney, who later became my Public Affairs Officer, happened
                    to be in the building at the time, on a visit from Embassy Moscow. There were
                    still, when I was living there, bullet holes in the glass that lined the
                    staircase leading up to the second floor from the lobby.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>So the situation was volatile. Many Russians were clearly reluctant to relinquish
                    the Baltic States. They considered them to be a signature acquisition of Peter
                    the Great. They considered that the territory had been bought with Russian
                    blood, that this relationship went back hundreds of years. There is also in
                    Russia a certain lack of appreciation and respect for small nations. Many
                    Russians are disinclined to take them seriously. Some Russians even felt that
                    way about the Swedes, I found. I remember when I told one of my Russian friends
                    in Leningrad that my next diplomatic assignment was going to be in Sweden, he
                    looked baffled and said, “Why would you want to go to such a small country?” And
                    he was an anti-authoritarian painter.</p>
                <p>Then, too, Latvia had become sort of a Palm Beach for retired KGB, Soviet
                    military and people with reactionary views about Russia and Russian history and
                    what Russia ought to be doing in that region. And so, with the continuing
                    presence of tens of thousands of disgruntled and unpaid Soviet troops and the
                    horrific economic collapse that followed Latvia's separation from the Soviet
                    Union... yes, the situation was still volatile.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there the feeling that this thing might not
                        hold?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes, there was that feeling. For part of the time I kept a journal, a
                    sort of personal diary that reflects some of my thoughts and feelings at the
                    time. I didn't start it until early '93, as I recall, and even at that late date
                    my very first entry, I remember, reflects a feeling that, oh my God, here comes
                    another round of really strong Russian pressure. Russia was launching attacks on
                    the Baltic States at the United Nations and dragging its feet on troop
                    withdrawals and I remember thinking, you know, this still is not a sure thing,
                    this is not a done deal, there's a long way to go, we need to have a strong U.S.
                    presence here to keep it moving forward.</p>
                <p>We also had to work on the Latvian side to make sure that those many Latvians who
                    felt a sense of national outrage at what had been done to them by Russia, that
                    they not overreact. Many of them, for example, didn't want to reach a signed
                    agreement on the withdrawal of Soviet forces. They felt that it would imply
                    recognition and even legal acceptance of the Soviet annexation, and we had to
                    talk them out of that. We felt that it was very important for future stability
                    that there be a clear, signed agreement that provided for the staged withdrawal
                    of Soviet forces and the removal of the strategic anti-missile radar site - a
                    “Hen House” radar - based at Skrunda in Latvia.</p>
                <p>So it was still a very touchy time. And then, of course, the economy went wholly,
                    completely to pot with an inflation rate that reached 1,000 percent in 1992.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, whom did you deal with when you got there? Was there
                        a government in place?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>SILINS: There was a government. What the Latvians and Estonians and Lithuanians
                    did initially was to adapt the elected structures from the Soviet period, the
                    Supreme Soviets, and turn them into representatives of independent governments
                    until sovereign constitutions and parliaments could be set up. So at first we
                    were dealing with people who had been elected under the Soviet era but who had
                    shown a clear intent to make their country independent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think these people would be so tainted that the
                        general population wouldn't accept them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Actually, that turned out not to be the case. And it proved possible to
                    have an orderly transition. In Latvia it worked out better than in some
                    countries with which I am familiar — Romania, for example. In Romania the old
                    gang clung to power even after they shot Ceausescu and his wife, so the Romanian
                    public, rightly, remained suspicious of them and their goals for a long time. In
                    Latvia it was less the case. There were still groups in Latvia, of course, that
                    showed reluctance to support Latvian independence, mostly ethnic Russians who
                    wanted to retain a strong link to Moscow. Those, of course, roused some
                    apprehensions, but it probably helped that they were represented in the
                    parliament because at least they weren't driven underground.</p>
                <p>Perhaps most important, though, is one key pragmatic consideration: things were
                    going to pot in Russia even faster than in Latvia. In other words, many Russians
                    in Latvia could see that they were better off in Latvia than in Russia,
                    certainly for the short term, and that Latvia was likely to get a lot more help
                    economically, relatively speaking, from the major West European countries and
                    the United States. I think that knowledge kept even nationalist Russians in
                    Latvia from soiling their own nests, so to speak. I mean, they didn't want to
                    leave Latvia for Russia because they would be worse off there, and they didn't
                    want to cause too much of a fuss in Latvia because that would just jeopardize
                    their own situation, both political and economic. After all, if they
                    consolidated their position in Latvia, they would eventually be in a position to
                    benefit from Latvia's growing links to the West. The net result was a fairly
                    orderly evolution toward a solid majority of people who wanted Latvia and the
                    other Baltic States to remain independent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were wearing two hats. One is just the plain
                        administrative hat, which would be enough to overwhelm anyone of trying to
                        set up an embassy. But the other hat was... you're the American
                        representative there, and how were you playing this? I mean, what were you
                        trying to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Let's focus first on the fact that I myself was born in Latvia but now
                    here I was, representing the U.S. That was a delicate issue, and I dealt with it
                    as best I could. I'm not sure, in retrospect, if I did that as well as I might
                    have. I probably overdid the “I am now American” side of things.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this often... you have to draw the line.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're not one of us, I mean, you...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Right. I did that not just to avoid confusing people about whom I was
                    representing but because one of my first messages, and it was not always
                    welcome, to the new representatives of the Latvian government was: people, don't
                    count on the West to solve all your problems. You are going to have to solve
                    your basic problems yourself. Don't just wait for aid; organize, figure out your
                    own solutions to your problems because that really is the only way it's going to
                    work. And one of the reasons why I stressed this message was my experience in
                    Haiti. Now, this may sound like a strange connection, but it was in Haiti that I
                    conceived a really profound skepticism about the efficacy of foreign assistance
                    to countries.</p>
                <p>Of course Haiti has its own particular problems. I also remember, of course, that
                    the Marshall Plan seemed to work pretty darned well in Europe - but Latvia
                    wasn't like postwar France or Germany. Latvia had a different set of problems to
                    solve that we in the West couldn't necessarily provide the best answers to. And
                    waiting for help from others can breed passivity. So I stressed self-help.</p>
                <p>I also perhaps didn't work as hard as I should have in reviving my own ability to
                    communicate in Latvian. I was able to speak fair Latvian, but normally in my
                    official meetings I spoke English. I wanted to convince Latvian officials that
                    they better learn English fast. I think that was the correct message, and the
                    fact that many of them did learn English quickly was a great plus. It made it a
                    lot easier for them to deal with the West.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you speak “teenage Latvian” anyway or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I spoke pretty good kitchen Latvian. I'm generally fairly gifted at
                    languages up to a point. Latvian was my first language so pronunciation was not
                    a problem. But Latvian is a highly inflected language with a complex grammar,
                    and I had quite consciously switched to English when I was very young. To this
                    day I don't feel comfortable addressing a difficult subject off the cuff in
                    Latvian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you, and maybe your European counterparts, were you
                        also telling the Latvian Latvians: don't go after the Russians here on your
                        soil; you've got to learn to live together?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>SILINS: Yes, we were preaching a lot about this. As I mentioned, lots of Latvians
                    felt deeply aggrieved by the Russians, who had annexed their country, killed or
                    driven out huge numbers of their countrymen, hijacked their economy, cut them
                    off from the West, and of course imposed the Russian language on them. As I
                    recall from my own calculations, Latvia experienced something like a net gain of
                    800,000 ethnic Russians, or Russian speakers, after Latvia was annexed by the
                    Soviet Union. For a small country of two-and-half million people, that's an
                    immense number, about a third of the population. That would be like the United
                    States having involuntarily to absorb 80 million Mexicans over a period of
                    several decades - if Mexico were a country with a population of over two billion
                    that had occupied and annexed the U.S.</p>
                <p>Latvians were almost reduced to a minority population by the time they regained
                    independence. So there was a vocal minority of Latvians calling for mass
                    repatriation of Russians. The U.S. Government, and other Western governments,
                    didn't see any workable way of repatriating hundreds of thousands or even tens
                    of thousands of Russians, particularly to a Russia that was, like Latvia, in
                    economic chaos. So that idea had to be shelved, and we were successful in doing
                    that. From the other side, to this day you hear from Moscow accusations that
                    Latvia does not give a fair shake to its Russian residents. But the CSCE has
                    investigated those claims year in, year out, and has not found them
                    persuasive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular types of Soviet troops there
                        that caused a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: The only serious violence that took place was the shootings that I
                    mentioned in January of '91 by the OMON, the Special Forces-type guys. But that
                    was a brief skirmish, thank God, and ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was over a radio tower, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I think the famous tower you may have in mind was in Vilnius, actually,
                    in Lithuania. In Latvia the OMON holed up in what became the interior ministry
                    building, opposite what became the American embassy in downtown Riga.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>In Latvia, aside from the public anxiety provoked by the presence of tens of
                    thousands of underpaid and poorly disciplined Soviet troops, a serious problem
                    was... well, let's call it vandalism. It was vandalism directed mostly, in fact
                    almost entirely, at facilities that the Soviet troops occupied or used, military
                    facilities. When they left them, as they did over time, they really stripped
                    them. They took out the wiring, the windows, doorknobs, plumbing fixtures...
                    anything you could think of to sell or re-use. Sometimes there was simply
                    malicious vandalism. I need not dwell, I think, on the details, but a historic
                    building near the university in downtown Riga that had been used as an officers
                    club was left in a very messy condition. The Soviet Navy, which was present in
                    force in the city of Liepaja, started stripping their ships of brass fittings
                    and so forth, actually causing many of them to sink at their berths, a pathetic
                    sight.</p>
                <p>Another kind of mess was from fuel. There was a lot of fuel leakage around their
                    fuel dumps. Apparently they took the word “fuel dump” literally. I remember as
                    ambassador going to a place near a former Soviet airfield where an American
                    company was trying to clean up the soil. They had drilled a pipe into the ground
                    and showed me that what they were pumping up was basically pure jet fuel, which
                    had been allowed to leak from a pipe that connected the storage tanks with
                    refueling pumps at the airfield. And I should mention, of course, the
                    explosives. There were target ranges with unexploded munitions and ammo dumps
                    and other things that had to be cleaned up. So it was a big, expensive mess
                    whose extent, I confess, shocked me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking now on the beautiful campus of the Foreign
                        Service Institute but this had been a military base for 50 years. It was not
                        a major facility but the fact that they had a motor pool here meant there
                        were leaks. And so they had to, you know, pull all the soil up around here
                        and aerate it or something before they could put it back in. If we're bad I
                        can imagine the Soviets would be much worse.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes. I think they took it to new heights or depths.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Latvians that you were
                        dealing with at the time? Were they hard-headed pragmatists or idealists; I
                        mean, what were you getting from them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: There was quite a spectrum across the leadership group. One of the most
                    effective leaders, because he was calm and reassuring during a tense period, was
                    a person who falls under the category we were just discussing, of former Soviet
                    officials. Anatolijs Gorbunovs had held a very high position in the Latvian
                    communist party, and so you might think that he was a poor choice to be the
                    acting head of the new transition government, but that wasn't true. He was able
                    to deal well with Russians; they knew him, he knew them. He was able to deal
                    well with Latvians; although his name may sound Russian he was considered to be
                    100 percent Latvian. He was able to deal quite well with Westerners, too,
                    although I don't think his English skills ever developed to a high point. But he
                    was an excellent choice to smooth over that transition period.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>When a fresh government was elected, the first prime minister was a former
                    physicist, Ivars Godmanis, who in fact until just recently was again prime
                    minister of Latvia. He resigned [20 February 2009] when the government collapsed
                    over the new round of economic difficulties there. He made a good first Latvian
                    prime minister for reasons sort of opposite to those that made Gorbunovs an
                    appropriate leader for his time. Godmanis was untainted by any previous
                    association with the communist party, at least in any official capacity. As a
                    scientist he was more or less insulated from that. He was very smart, as
                    physicists often are. He had strong analytical skills; he could size up a
                    problem and figure out how to attack it. He had been active in the independence
                    movement so he had credibility with the more nationalist groups among Latvians.
                    I believe he was very effective in getting Latvia through an extremely difficult
                    time, but he took the rap for it. As is often the case, even if someone succeeds
                    in getting you through a hard time, what you remember is the hard time and not
                    the getting through. Poor Godmanis, when the next round of elections came, his
                    party didn't even get into the parliament, so in effect he was dumped for his
                    pains.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did things work for you? You say you weren't a charg�
                        at first, you were just kind of there, and then what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: The process was this. All three of us who were going to be nominated as
                    ambassadors were first sent out TDY [on temporary duty]. This is very unusual;
                    normally you have confirmation hearings with the Senate Foreign Relations
                    committee and agr�ment is requested from the government to which you will be
                    accredited. In this case, in order to accelerate the process, we were sent out,
                    first of all, to set up the missions, then we were nominated by the State
                    Department. After going through the usual clearance process, we were all, I
                    think, confirmed by the Senate at about the same time. In my case that was in
                    late March of '92. After my confirmation hearing, I flew back to Strasbourg to
                    join my wife Elizabeth. We loaded up our station wagon with essential items,
                    including our yellow Labrador Brio, and in April drove from Strasbourg to Riga
                    by way of stops in Prague and Warsaw. That was the basic drill: first on TDY to
                    open up the missions, then back to Washington, get nominated, go through the
                    Senate confirmation process and some training, and then out in the spring of '92
                    as designated ambassadors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that you would find yourself with members of
                        the Latvian exile community who had been in the United States maybe for
                        their whole lives breathing down your neck, who had political clout, who
                        wanted to get in there and start doing things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: You mean who would like to be ambassador?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Either ambassador or just sort of come in and sort of take
                        over.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well no, I didn't really find that. Although some American Latvians were
                    a bit frustrated at what they perceived as the slow pace of the Bush
                    Administration in setting up embassies, recognizing the Baltic States, and so
                    forth, I think in general they were quite satisfied with what the U.S.
                    Government was doing. The fact that I was an ethnic Latvian and a career
                    diplomat with highly relevant experience made it hard for any members of the
                    U.S. Latvian community to say, well, wait a minute, we want a real Latvian in
                    there. I'm not aware of anyone who was jockeying for my position. We did have
                    quite a number of ethnic Latvians who in fact went out there, some of them
                    before I did, certainly before I arrived as ambassador, who wanted to help, to
                    do something on all kinds of fronts, either to help form a new government or
                    some of the early entrepreneurs to get in on the ground floor and start building
                    up business in Latvia. So yes, there was a wave of returnees to the Baltic
                    States, in particular to Lithuania, which is the largest country and which had
                    the largest pool of residents in the U.S. to draw from.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find working there as ambassador? I mean, were
                        you part of, you might say, a Western team of ambassadors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Definitely, yes. There was a tightly knit and closely communicating team
                    of Western ambassadors. We generally met at the residence or embassy of whoever
                    was the dean of the corps, that is, the longest serving member. To start off, it
                    was the German ambassador, Hagen Graf Lambsdorff, whose family has a long
                    Baltic/Russian connection. Toward the end of my tour I became the informal head.
                    All the NATO- and EC-member ambassadors were part of the team. We consulted with
                    each other all the time because we felt that we faced common problems, common
                    issues. Even before the embassies as such were open there was close consultation
                    with other Western governments and in particular the Nordic countries. Sweden
                    played a lead role vis-�-vis Latvia.</p>
                <p>I may have mentioned that I brought a group of Latvian parliamentarians to
                    Washington for consultations in, I believe, early '94 because some political
                    parties were still stubbornly resisting the idea of signing an agreement with
                    the Soviet Union about troop withdrawal. I escorted the delegation, which
                    represented all the political parties in the Latvian parliament, to reassuring
                    conversations with top U.S. government officials, including President Clinton
                    and Vice President Gore. We then took them to the residence of the Swedish
                    ambassador in Washington for more talks with their European counterparts. I
                    believe that to an important extent it was the Swedes who helped persuade them
                    that holding out was not a wise position, that an agreement with Russia was the
                    best way to go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about dealing with... I guess when you first arrived
                        it was still the Soviet ambassador, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>SILINS: The Soviet Union folded at the end of 1991, so for almost all of my time
                    as ambassador there was also a Russian ambassador, that is, a representative of
                    the Russian Federation, Aleksandr Rannikh. I found it easy to have a good
                    relationship with him because he didn't have the mentality of a typical Soviet
                    career official. If I remember correctly, he had risen through the ranks, having
                    started off as an interpreter and spent a lot of time in Finland. I didn't deal
                    with him much on substance. Key Latvian-Russian issues, and the key one was
                    really Russian troop withdrawals, he and I did not address bilaterally. Those
                    were handled at the highest level in Washington and Moscow, ultimately at the
                    presidential level.</p>
                <p>Rannikh and I talked sometimes in an informal way about relations in Latvia
                    between Russians and Latvians. I took it upon myself to try to change his
                    thinking about how to look at the history of Latvia and Latvia's relationship
                    with Russia. I thought perhaps he might suffer from the same warped perspective
                    that a lot of Russians do, because that's what their history textbooks teach
                    them - that the Baltic States had joined the USSR voluntarily and benefited from
                    the relationship. I found, to my pleasure, that possibly because of the time he
                    spent in Finland he knew where I was coming from, understood the history better
                    than lots of people in his own foreign ministry, but really wasn't, he said, in
                    a position to do much about it. There are some anecdotes about this in a short
                    journal that I kept sporadically while in Riga, parts of which have been
                    published in various formats. One version of it is in a book published in
                    English by the University of Latvia in 2008, Latvia and the USA: From Captive
                    Nation to Strategic Partner.</p>

                <p>SILINS: Yes, let's consider that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we just add it as an adjunct? I mean, this of
                        course would be extremely valuable and it will also be available through the
                        Library of Congress and it would fit into the whole thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I think that's a good idea. I'll add it at the end of the interview.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how were relations between the Baltic countries? I
                        mean, I assume they all had their own grievances.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: That's a very good question. I think there was an expectation in
                    Washington that, well, these countries have suffered similar fates and so
                    they'll want to work closely together in molding their futures. Of course, it
                    doesn't always work out that way. They were a bit like hostages who after
                    they're released do not necessarily want to spend all their time together. They
                    want to go off in their own directions.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And we always lump them together.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: We do, we do. Because it's hard, really, to keep track; for a
                    non-specialist it's hard even to remember which is which. And so yes, there was
                    this automatic pressure to treat them as more or less identical, which they of
                    course resented. And of course it's also true that they're in some sense natural
                    competitors, you know. In some ways they are good at the same things and
                    therefore compete at those things.</p>
                <p>Ultimately I think it worked out pretty well because they're also pretty
                    realistic, these countries, and they realized that they do have to work
                    together. Probably the strongest force keeping them, shall we say, in line, was
                    their desire for membership in two organizations, the European Union and NATO.
                    The reminder that they should not be too unruly or seen to be uncooperative was
                    most effective when it was in the context of a path toward membership in the EU
                    or NATO, and that proved to be effective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did Kaliningrad fit into this? Because that's an old
                        Soviet name... I think of it as K�nigsberg.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: It was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And where did that fit in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, Kaliningrad is an as yet undigested remnant of the old Soviet
                    empire. I find it hard to imagine that it will persist indefinitely in its
                    detached state. You're right; it was called K�nigsberg. That's where Immanuel
                    Kant, the most famous philosopher, lived a very orderly life. It became
                    essentially a Soviet military base after World War II. The remnants of its past
                    were largely annihilated but Moscow wanted, indeed insisted on holding on to it
                    as an integral part of the Russian Federation, and so one of the more
                    complicated aspects of dealing with the newly independent status of the Baltic
                    States was working out access for Russia to Kaliningrad; resupply and visa
                    questions and transit issues and so forth. It's enveloped by Lithuania and
                    there's no direct contact with Latvia, so we watched it from a distance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a sense, in Latvia, that the people you were
                        dealing with were taking a very close look at what was happening in Russia
                        at the time? I mean, you know, ready for a resurgence or what have you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>SILINS: Absolutely, yes. Latvians were very, very keenly attuned to what was
                    going on in Russia, as were the Russians in Latvia, of whom there were, you
                    know, hundreds of thousands. Of course, early in the Soviet era, before the U.S.
                    entered into diplomatic relations with Moscow after the Bolshevik Revolution,
                    for us Latvia was of interest primarily as an observation post, a window looking
                    into Russia. That's why George Kennan went to Riga, not to pay much attention to
                    Latvia but to see what he could learn about what was going on in communist
                    Russia. To this day, everyone who has anything to do with Latvia realizes that
                    if the situation evolves in an unfavorable direction in Russia, it's likely to
                    impact very negatively very quickly on Latvia. So they're interested not just in
                    political developments but in economic ones. One of the hopes for prosperity in
                    Latvia was as a transit country for Russia. That is, goods would be shipped from
                    Russia to the West through Latvia and from the West to Russia through Latvia.
                    That's how it used to make a lot of its money back in the Middle Ages. Bad
                    relations with Russia would immediately be reflected by slow transit times
                    across the Latvian-Russian border, and that unfortunately is true to this day.
                    That border remains an unpredictable and difficult place to get across.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was oil or natural gas an issue while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Both are to this day. Oil was pumped by Russia across Latvia to the port
                    of Ventspils and then shipped from there to the West. That pipeline became,
                    first of all, a source of a lot of money in Latvia because Latvia would collect
                    transshipment fees. It then turned into a point of tension, because the Russians
                    felt the fees being charged were too high. The Russians also wanted to develop a
                    purely nationally controlled exit point for oil and petroleum products closer to
                    St. Petersburg, so they eventually cut the Latvian pipeline off. For years the
                    oil pipeline across Latvia, to my understanding, has not been used, although
                    some oil continues to flow from Russia to Ventspils in freight cars, which is
                    much more expensive and cumbersome.</p>
                <p>As for natural gas, it is Latvia's main source of heating fuel in the winter, and
                    Latvia is entirely dependent on Russia for it. Latvia is blessed with huge
                    underground storage facilities, natural caverns that can be used to store
                    natural gas. So it had a buffer of sorts, luckily, because Russia several times
                    stopped the flow of natural gas to Latvia, over disputes about the price or to
                    make a political point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Poland? Was Poland a factor?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>SILINS: Poland was, I think, a big factor vis-�-vis Lithuania, with both positive
                    and negative overtones because of the tangled history of the two countries. If
                    my memory is correct, what is now Lithuania's capital, Vilnius, was not part of
                    Lithuania during Lithuania's first modern appearance as an independent state; it
                    lay in territory annexed by Poland in the 1920's, much to Lithuania's outrage.
                    So Lithuania actually gained a sizeable stretch of territory when it was
                    occupied by the USSR, because Moscow reattached the missing bit, which was
                    retained when Lithuania became independent again. On the other hand, farther
                    back is a more positive and equally intimate historical link between Lithuania
                    and Poland. They were, in effect, joint managers of a serious empire, the
                    Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth or Union, which for about two centuries stretched
                    from the Baltic to the Black Sea. Memories of that period of grandeur form an
                    important part of Lithuania's cultural and psychological heritage. So I suspect
                    Poland looms large on the Lithuanian mental horizon, but I can't say that Poland
                    was a strong player in Latvia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Finland, Sweden?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes. Both were very important, particularly, as I mentioned, Sweden.
                    Sweden was first on the ground with a diplomatic post in Latvia, in Riga, headed
                    by a very talented young man named Lars Fred�n, who knew everybody and
                    everything and was a great help to the other newcomer ambassadors reporting in
                    from Western countries. I had an advantage in that I'd been there before, spoke
                    the language and so forth, but I still always found him valuable to talk to.</p>
                <p>Sweden also became effective as an advisor to the new Latvian government on
                    questions like, how does a parliamentary system work, that sort of thing, and
                    also in terms of economic aid and in encouraging Swedish businessmen set up shop
                    in Latvia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Finland play any role at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Finland played a very, very active role in Estonia, even more active
                    there proportionately than Sweden was in Latvia, and that's because really the
                    Estonians and the Finns are close cousins, virtually brothers. The languages are
                    very similar. They actually can understand each other, which is not true, for
                    example, of Latvians and Lithuanians. The languages are related but I really
                    can't just sit down and have a conversation with a Lithuanian, whereas Estonians
                    were able to watch Finnish television, even during the Soviet era. Because
                    they're very, very close, Finns used to come either by boat or by train to
                    Estonia, driven in part by the desire for cheap vodka, but that turned into a
                    very serious business connection when Estonia became independent. Now Finland
                    plays a leading role in Estonia, to the extent that some Estonians proclaim
                    their country a Nordic rather than a Baltic one.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had a little taste of the American non-governmental
                        organization relationship with the Stans. I went out for three weeks to
                        Kyrgyzstan to talk to the government on a USIA grant about setting up a
                        consular service. And I was astounded at the NGO people. I mean, some very
                        good and some, I would say, dubious and then also the missionary movement.
                        But there was a tremendous flow to the East from the United States of
                        various organizations giving economic advice, converting to Christianity,
                        anything you could think about. How did you find dealing with this and how
                        did it work for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: There was quite a lot of that in Latvia. In general I would say that the
                    most active NGOs tended to be Latvian-American or Latvian-Australian or what
                    have you, organizations that in general played a very positive role. Some of
                    their members came over and worked not just as representatives of that
                    organization but joined the government, went into business or became an integral
                    part of Latvian society. Latvia, like the other two Baltic countries, made it
                    possible for the offspring of former Latvian citizens to reclaim their
                    citizenship. You didn't necessarily have to be born in Latvia to come back and
                    get your passport. If, for example, your parents were born in Latvia and they
                    had left the country because the Soviets occupied it after the Second World War,
                    you could get your passport. Quite a number of people did that, and once they
                    did that they could integrate into the local scene. Further helping the process
                    along was the Latvian government's decision to restore property rights to the
                    descendants of citizens whose lands and buildings had been nationalized by the
                    Soviets.</p>
                <p>There were also non-ethnic Westerners of all different types and some of them
                    were helpful and some were not. When the situation stabilized and people in the
                    West could see that Latvia was going to make it as an independent country, we
                    began to have quite a lot of evangelicals coming and, in my opinion, not always
                    playing a terribly positive role. They were responding to what they thought of
                    as a suppressed demand for religion, and it was true that that was the case. I
                    mean, the Soviets had very strongly discouraged religion but the varieties being
                    offered by some of these proselytizers were not always, I think, the best.
                    Sometimes they preyed on weakness rather than providing a source of
                    strength.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the church there? Was there a Latvian Orthodox
                        Church?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Latvia had a broad representation of religious groups. It was the most
                    cosmopolitan of all of the Baltic capitals for hundreds of years and had
                    churches of many denominations for centuries. So what you had represented there
                    were Jews, Russian Orthodox, you had Lutherans, Catholics; pretty much anything
                    you wanted, suppressed of course during the Soviet era but with the remnants
                    still there. I think of Latvians as predominantly Lutheran, but Catholics are
                    also very numerous and of course there is a strong contingent of Russian
                    Orthodox.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>At the same time Latvians are, let's say, more like Swedes with respect to
                    religion than the Lithuanians. Lithuania had an ardent Catholic tradition that
                    persisted during the Soviet era, and the underground church, or even the
                    acknowledged, the official church played an active role in, let's call them
                    Lithuanian national issues; that is, they kept alive the notion of Lithuania as
                    a potentially independent entity. As the Catholic Church in Poland, for example,
                    was very active in the underground nationalist movement all through the Soviet
                    era. Latvians are a little bit more, shall we say, standoffish vis-�-vis
                    religion, with of course lots and lots of exceptions, but they tend more toward
                    the secular than their Lithuanian neighbors. That's also true, I think, of
                    Estonians. But that's not to say that the churches did not play an important
                    role; they certainly did, and they continue to do that to this day. And churches
                    of course were among the first organizations to establish links with the West as
                    quickly as they could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a representative of the European Community when
                        you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes, there was, and they started the highly technical talks, negotiations
                    really, of paving the way for Latvia and of course the other Baltic States to
                    become full-fledged members of the EC and then the EU. And that was the arduous
                    process of digesting the, what's the French term for it? Not the fait
                    accompli... The acquis communautaire - what's already been legislated and
                    adopted by the member states. They had to, in effect, adopt en masse all the
                    legislation that the EC as a group had already taken on board. Just the
                    translation was an awesome job of work, to say nothing of putting it through the
                    national legislative mill. So that was a busy track and very important for the
                    future of the country, but taking place mostly in technical channels, setting
                    the stage for full-fledged membership. Now the EC was very important but not
                    typically much heard from publicly. Their representatives assiduously avoided
                    speaking out on internal political issues. That was not their game and so they
                    were not much heard from in the local media.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about NATO? You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: From the fall of '91 until the summer of '95, so a pretty broad span.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was a long period. Was it sort of understood from
                        the beginning that these countries would be absorbed into NATO or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>SILINS: No, not at all. It wasn't a sure thing, and I think many Russians to this
                    day are aghast that the Baltic States were absorbed into NATO. In fact,
                    Gorbachev may even believe that he was given the promise that they would not be.
                    No, it was contentious right from the start for obvious reasons. This is
                    territory that the Russians considered an integral part of their nation and
                    suddenly it's going to be absorbed into a military organization whose founding
                    purpose was to oppose Russia by military force! So yes, it was a contentious
                    issue because at the time the remnants of Soviet forces are still inside these
                    states. So there was a lot of debate about it, not just between the West and
                    Russia but within U.S. policy circles, the public. People argued that it would
                    be provocative to Russia, that there was no need for it; that after all, since
                    the Cold War was over, why on earth would we want to not only perpetuate but
                    actually expand an organization whose raison d'�tre seemed to be behind it? So
                    there was a lot of debate about that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you're a Russia hand. My understanding is that, you
                        know, sort of the zeitgeist of the Russia hands was let's not...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: We don't need this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We don't need this, you know, because this would upset
                        Russia. How did you feel about this and how did this play sort of internally
                        with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I have to say on this issue that I can't claim to have been an important
                    player because I always had very mixed feelings about it. I cannot claim, do not
                    claim to have been an ardent advocate of Baltic NATO membership; at the same
                    time, if you asked, on balance, which side was I more for, it would be NATO
                    membership, no question about that. The main justification really was this, in
                    my mind: you couldn't leave them out. If we left them out they would become a
                    kind of a gray area, a zone of instability, basically. That was the bottom line.
                    In fact, I could see no way around that argument. As long as NATO exists and as
                    long as NATO operates on the principle that any European country willing to
                    accept its rules and voluntarily asking to join it would be admitted, then I
                    don't see how you could keep them out. Because if we told them no, then what
                    we're saying, no matter what we want to say or think we're saying, what we are
                    saying to the Russians is, you guys have a say about what happens in the zone;
                    it's basically your backyard, and you can have a perhaps even controlling
                    influence on what happens here. And I did not think we should be doing that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I have to say I agree with you. It is also
                        troubling.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>When you arrived, did the Latvians talk NATO right from the beginning?</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>SILINS: Not exactly. In the very early days, the main military issue was not
                    “NATO in” but “Warsaw Pact out.” That was the focus, how to get the remnants of
                    the Soviet military structure out of the Baltic States. Most Latvians, as I
                    recall at the time, had the good sense not to be too vociferous in public about
                    seeking NATO membership while this issue remained unresolved. But there was
                    little doubt about where their sentiments lay, and most of the active political
                    leaders made it clear early in the game that their two major goals were NATO
                    membership and membership of the European Union. That's how they thought they
                    would ensure the security and prosperity of their country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a Latvian military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: That's a good question. There was not really a Latvian military, no. That
                    was one of the big problems and it took a lot of our time and attention to solve
                    it.</p>
                <p>Latvians, of course, had served in the Soviet military, but the officers produced
                    by that experience, most of us felt, were not the best guides to setting up a
                    new independent Latvian military. The Soviet military system is notorious for
                    its defects, in particular the way it treats its recruits. Hazing was vicious
                    and apparently still persists in the Russian military. They lacked an effective
                    NCO (non-commissioned officer) system, which is the heart of the American
                    military. I mean, the NCOs - the smart, tough, experienced career soldiers - are
                    really what make our army the best in the world. The Soviets didn't have
                    anything comparable to that; it was a very top-down approach, plus, of course,
                    all the political indoctrination that goes with Soviet military training. There
                    were a few veterans of that Soviet experience that surfaced as potential
                    organizers of a new independent Latvian military, but we didn't think that that
                    would work out too well.</p>
                <p>What we did was to turn to our National Guard structure as a starting point
                    because we thought the first priority was not some sort of, you know, special
                    forces type operation for Latvia but a National Guard type of structure that
                    would be the most relevant to Baltic security needs. And to do that, and I think
                    this was a good choice, we forged links between state National Guard units in
                    the United States and the Baltic States. In the case of Latvia, Michigan was the
                    state that came to mind. It happens there are a number of Latvians in Michigan,
                    and the Michigan National Guard really rose to the occasion. They began in a
                    very low key way in helping the Latvians with the basics. We also were able to
                    get some former U.S. military officers to come as advisors. One of them, a
                    Latvian-American, actually became a minister of defense in Latvia. And so that
                    was the route we took to rebuilding the military.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can see the National Guard makes good sense because in a
                        way, at least to start off, the National Guard has a role of protecting
                        internal order, disaster relief, this type of thing, which is what you would
                        want; a small country, it's not going to be there to stand off the Russian
                        army. It's mainly an internal guard.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Right. But it was not easy to attract young Latvians into the military.
                    There was a lingering antipathy toward military service because of the bitter
                    Soviet experience. You know, lots of Latvians were sent off to Afghanistan by
                    the Soviets. And of course the pay was terrible and the facilities had just been
                    vandalized by the Russians, so it was tough sledding to start with.</p>
                <p>I have to praise the Latvian leadership for seeing right from the start, though,
                    that they had to aim beyond just the National Guard approach. They had taken on
                    board very early the lesson that if you're want to join NATO you have to be, in
                    the rather inelegant phrase, not just a consumer of security but also a producer
                    of security. Meaning that you can't just say okay, I'm in, now protect me, but
                    you also have to offer some services, some contribution of your own. The Baltic
                    States understood this right from the start, and so small though they were,
                    that's why they signed on, this of course much later, when the U.S. went into
                    Afghanistan and to a lesser extent they helped with Iraq. In the earlier era,
                    before Afghanistan and Iraq, they were preparing their soldiers to act as
                    observers in troubled areas, wherever they might be, in Africa or the Middle
                    East, what have you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Bosnia, was this..?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes, that sort of thing. And I think that was very wise, they realized
                    that they needed that kind of training and that kind of experience, so they
                    could say, when someone asked them, well why should we help you out? Well,
                    because we can do this, this and this and we have done so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Did you get involved in the early development of
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well sure, as ambassador at a small embassy I was involved to some extent
                    with everything. I worked with the National Guard and kept their morale up and
                    made sure that link was working well. I visited their training sites, talked to
                    the Latvian military establishment to make sure they understood the importance
                    of what was going on and that they appreciated it in the long run.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think there would be a tremendous problem of
                        trying to change a military to, you know, to reflect the NATO way of doing
                        things rather than the Soviet system of officers dumping on the enlisted
                        men. I would think it would be very wrenching to change that. I mean, how
                        does this work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, you do it step by step and you do it by taking people to the U.S.
                    for training, for example, so that you get them totally out of the Soviet
                    environment and show them in person how it works in the West, put them into the
                    context. So we sent quite a lot of people at various levels, from West Point on
                    down, for training in the U.S., both long term and short term, and brought in
                    sizeable numbers of National Guard people to convey in a more dramatic sense how
                    the mentality actually operates.</p>
                <p>One of the things that we used the National Guard for was not just military
                    training but really as exemplars, as role models. They would do volunteer
                    projects. You know, there was so much that needed to be done all through Latvia
                    that there was no lack of possibilities. For example, if there were a school
                    near where they were based, on weekends they would form a team and go fix things
                    up or paint up a classroom, stuff like that, to get the concept of volunteerism
                    going, which was not widely accepted in Latvia except in the sense of something
                    that's directed from above and, you know, you have to do it because the party
                    tells you to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you have to work to develop a real party system
                        or did the Latvian system fall into parties almost naturally?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: You're talking about political structure?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. You know, conservative, liberal or whatever you
                        want to call it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Like most countries, Latvia does not tend toward a tidy two-party system.
                    The U.S. is rather unusual in this respect. When Latvia was independent between
                    the two World Wars, it developed an excess of political parties. I think at one
                    point it had something like 40 political parties, which is, to say the least,
                    too many for a small country. It has a tendency toward political
                    fragmentation.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>Initially, though, in 1991 and 1992, perhaps the main factor was the unpleasant
                    memory of the rigid and oppressive Communist Party, which gave the whole notion
                    of political party membership a bad name and made people reluctant to throw
                    themselves into political organizational work. The first Latvian governments
                    were formed by groupings that were not really political parties, more like
                    national task forces. The first was the broadly based Popular Front, whose main
                    unifying goal was the restoration of Latvia's independence. That goal was
                    achieved, but when Latvia's economy crashed after being cut off from the Soviet
                    infrastructure in which it had been embedded, the Popular Front crashed with it.
                    It did not win a single seat in the Latvian parliament, the Saeima, in the 1993
                    election. This despite having won about 75% of the vote in the 1990
                    election!</p>
                <p>Next at bat was a coalition called “Latvia's Way.” It was also called “The Best
                    of the East and the West” because it comprised, on the one hand, people who had
                    grown up under the Soviet system in Latvia, and on the other hand, Latvians who
                    had spent much of their lives in the West and who brought to the table an
                    entirely different experience. But by now there were more than 20 registered
                    political parties in Latvia. “Latvia's Way” only won about a third of the votes
                    and had to join with the Farmers Union to form a government. So a pattern was
                    set whereby there would be broad, fairly reliable support for basic goals like
                    independence, free markets, rule of law, membership in NATO and the EU, but with
                    a proliferation of small parties squabbling about the details of policy
                    implementation and the sharing of assets. Coalition governments, often hanging
                    by a thread, became the order of the day.</p>
                <p>I suppose this was inevitable because Latvian society is quite heterogeneous and
                    still in flux. You know, political parties reflect the societies out of which
                    they spring. If you have a fragmented society, then you're going to have a
                    fragmented political system. You also have, in Latvia, a tendency to think of a
                    political party as sort of like a church - you know, either it meets all your
                    needs or you're not going to join it at all. A reluctance to compromise on
                    issues. So that creates a strong pressure for small parties representing a
                    narrow range of interests, and that doesn't work well on the national scene.
                    What the answer to that is I really am not sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a reflection of what developed into the
                        Russian mafia? I mean, the criminal element. Did that spill over into Latvia
                        at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: To some extent, yes. In the early stages we had a few economic
                    assassinations, killings that were clearly the product of struggle between
                    organized crime groups. Luckily that didn't last long. Then organized crime took
                    a different form. It spilled into politics in a way that was only quasi illegal.
                    It took the form that the World Bank calls “state capture.” That is, more or
                    less legal business groups buying influence from parliamentarians and in effect
                    buying legislation or controlling candidates to political office. And that still
                    remains a problem in Latvia today, as it does throughout much of the world,
                    including the U.S.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Clinton Administration when it came in was focused
                        rather heavily on the economy. Was there a change from Bush I Administration
                        to the Clinton Administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: As regards policy toward Latvia I would say, no. It was sort of ironic.
                    When Reagan was succeeded by the first President Bush, there seemed to be more
                    of a change as regards policy toward the Soviet Union, even though they were
                    from the same political party, than in the transition from Bush, who was a
                    Republican, to Clinton, a Democrat, vis-�-vis Baltic policy. In part, I think
                    that was because the National Security Council staff, as I recall, remained
                    largely the same, so the professionals working the problem showed a lot of
                    continuity. Also the Latvian-Americans and other Baltic-Americans remained very
                    active on Capitol Hill and throughout Washington, keeping the Baltic story in
                    front of political leaders and the public.</p>
                <p>At that time the Baltic States were still seen as interesting and got quite a lot
                    of press. You know, their fate was not yet a fully resolved problem. People
                    still saw them as, not exactly cliffhangers, but exciting success stories. The
                    underdog who makes it. The Three Mice Who Roared. Americans love that kind of
                    story. So I think, Clinton, he's politically very smart, he knows how to read a
                    situation. He knew that this was the kind of thing it was important to remain on
                    the right side of. So I found no problem at all, really, no threat of change of
                    policy, and indeed Bill Clinton was the first sitting president to visit the
                    Baltic States in person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that visit go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Very well. It was really a visit to all three Baltic leaders, not just
                    Latvia. They were all assembled in Riga, the Baltic heads of state, and met with
                    him. Clinton's stay in Riga was very short but packed with a lot of ceremony,
                    such as a mass gathering at the foot of Latvia's Freedom Monument, that was
                    meant to convey a strong, positive public impression. It was as much a message,
                    I think, to Moscow as it was to the local population, a sign that the U.S. cares
                    at the very highest level about the fate of these countries, is willing to show
                    the president's own personal interest and engagement with them. And in that
                    respect I think it was highly successful. Not least, the weather was brilliant,
                    beautiful. Elizabeth escorted Hillary, my son Nicholas squired Chelsea, and a
                    good time was had by all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a feeling that we were continually, during
                        this period, laying down markers, that we care about this, and these
                        countries are going to stay this way, this is not something that is
                        interesting but will go away?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Definitely.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Staking out territory, in a way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes. Well, we hoped it was staking out territory, not in the sense that
                    we're staking our claim to it, but that these are independent countries, they
                    are an integral part of the West, part of Western Europe, part of the
                    Transatlantic Alliance, and that while we did not mean to use them to threaten
                    Russia, we would not look kindly on attempts to meddle with their basic
                    rights.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Russian Fleet play any role or was it more
                        concerned about glowing at night or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, I recall one of my journal entries from the spring of '93. The
                    Soviet Fleet, now the Russian Fleet, which had moved out of Liepaja and was now
                    operating out of nearby Kaliningrad, engaged in threatening war games off the
                    coast of Latvia. So there was gesturing also from the other side, as if to say:
                    No, we are not gone yet, we still think of the Baltic as our lake and we feel
                    that we have a right to dictate what might affect the security of this region.
                    There was signaling going both ways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well Ints, is there anything else we should talk about
                        concerning this Latvian period that you can think of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: There is a lot we haven't touched on but maybe we can cover some of it in
                    the next phase. After I left Latvia I spent two years at the University of
                    Chicago, and one of my activities there was a Baltic conference that covered
                    some of these issues. And of course there is more material about my time in
                    Latvia in the journal that I will attach to this interview.</p>
                <p>Here I might just add that the fate of the Baltic States gains added interest and
                    importance, as former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt pointed out, because
                    they serve as a litmus test of Russian policy. That is, how Russia deals with
                    them, particularly now that they are in the EU, is a very good indicator of how
                    Russia sees its relationship with all of Western Europe. It reveals the Russian
                    hand. If Russia acts as though it has the right to dictate to these near
                    neighbors, what they call their “near abroad,” then that suggests that they're
                    likely to deal in a similar manner, if they can get away with it, with other
                    West European countries. If they're inclined to cut off natural gas supplies to
                    Latvia because they're angry at Latvia for some political reason, then they
                    might cut off the gas supply to Germany if they are angry at Germans. So the
                    Baltic area, I think, has an ability to shed light on larger issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well, we'll talk about all that next time.
                        Great.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, today is 16th of March, 2009, with Ints Silins. This
                        is a reprise because our first session of a few minutes ago didn't seem to
                        be recording, so let's hope this works.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Okay, Ints, we're going to pick up on talking about some final thoughts about
                    your time in Latvia, and you were talking about the relationship of the
                    ambassador to the Washington establishment.</p>
                <p>SILINS: Right. It was my experience, and I think it's not an atypical one, that I
                    as ambassador wasn't used as effectively as I might have been, in the sense that
                    issues seemed to gravitate more toward Washington-based high level officials,
                    either by phone or personal visit. This has been pretty much the rule since the
                    era of fast communications and the Kissinger global junkets, in which I
                    participated when I served on the Executive Secretariat. More and more, the
                    “normal” way to handle big foreign-policy questions became to have someone from
                    Washington do it. The result is that foreign countries don't take ambassadors as
                    seriously as they might, because ambassadors are not identified with the
                    resolution of top-level issues. There's no need, I think, to cite any particular
                    examples of this...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you might cite the one in New York.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes, well, when President Clinton had a meeting with the three Baltic
                    presidents in New York in September 1993, he did not invite his own ambassadors
                    to those countries to sit in. I was in New York at the time to give a talk to
                    the Council on Foreign Relations and to meet with George Kennan, and I did sit
                    in on another meeting with Latvian President Ulmanis in New York, but none of
                    the three U.S. Baltic ambassadors was in the meeting with President Clinton. If
                    I were one of those Baltic presidents, I could only conclude that the three U.S.
                    ambassadors seemed not to enjoy ready access to Clinton, so they may not be an
                    integral part of the top-level foreign policy process.</p>
                <p>From the point of view of U.S. interests, implicitly downgrading your ambassadors
                    is not a constructive way to use your foreign policy tools. Many issues arise
                    that are important but lack the towering urgency needed to get them onto the
                    desk of the president or the secretary of state. Those issues have to be
                    resolved, and the logical person to do that would be the ambassador. But if his
                    influence has been undercut by being left out at key moments, it becomes harder
                    for him to accomplish that.</p>
                <p>I don't want to exaggerate here; I did not feel that I was an insignificant part
                    of the apparatus. And of course it's also up to the ambassador to establish his
                    credentials as a serious player in foreign policy. I just think that ambassadors
                    could be used more effectively by the U.S. rather than trying to do so much out
                    of Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well also, you know, it's true in so many countries where
                        the ambassadors understand its culture, I mean... The prime example always
                        is dealing with, you might say, Arab kings or with the Japanese. When high
                        level people come out, they go in with a request or something and they come
                        back and the report is oh, we'll certainly think that over, and the
                        ambassador or somebody will say, you know, that wasn't a good meeting; he
                        said no. I mean, this happens again and again. If you know the culture, one
                        sees an opening or something that somebody who's flying in from Washington
                        doesn't really understand.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Right. I think the issue is more acute with countries that are in a
                    position to do us real harm if they are misinterpreted and mishandled. Latvia
                    was not such a case, fairly obviously; Latvia is quite dependent on the U.S.,
                    grateful to the U.S. for saving it from becoming a permanent part of Russia, and
                    therefore was going to listen to me no matter how I was treated by the president
                    and the secretary of state. But it's a general issue that merits consideration
                    in some other forum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, by the way, we're including in this... you did
                        essentially a diary would you say, or a journal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I call it a journal. It was sporadic and I didn't begin it until May of
                    '93 when I'd already been ambassador for some time, almost a year and a half.
                    It's not meant to be a comprehensive record of my official activities, it has
                    some personal stuff in there. But what it does convey, I think, is some of the
                    feeling, the atmosphere of the time, which was still a highly volatile period.
                    There were still barricades up when I arrived in Riga, the economy was tanking,
                    the inflation rate hit 1,000 percent. It's easy to forget these things; it's
                    easy to forget how threatening some high-level Russian statements were at that
                    time, and some of that is in the journal and it might be of interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. I don't know if I've asked you, but something
                        I've never understood: what do you do in a country when the inflation rate
                        is 1,000 percent? I go back to Yugoslavia where the dinar was about 25 cents
                        to the dollar. I've seen a bill for half a trillion dinars. Now, what the
                        hell do you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>SILINS: The recent poster child, of course, is Zimbabwe, where the exchange rate
                    just went out of sight. In Latvia, blessedly, that period did not last very
                    long. It was handled, first of all, by issuing a transitional currency, the
                    Latvian ruble, to replace the Russian ruble. Then, when conditions were judged
                    right, luckily not much later, a Latvian currency called the lat, or lats in
                    Latvian, was launched. To general surprise, it appreciated steadily against the
                    dollar and became one of the most stable currencies in the Western World. It was
                    first loosely tied to an IMF basket of currencies, then to the euro, and it has
                    maintained its value steadily, year in, year out, until the present day. Now,
                    because the Latvian economy like all other economies is having a setback, it has
                    been threatened by rumors of devaluation, but it has not weakened and it has
                    been a very safe place to keep your money.</p>
                <p>But your question was, what do you do when you have that inflation rate? You do a
                    lot less shopping and you do more bartering. You rely more on your own
                    resources, you eat your own garden products. You share things and swap things
                    until the problem goes away. The main impact was that everybody's savings were
                    wiped out, so it was everybody scrubbing the board clean and starting all over.
                    And that was devastating for pensioners and others without income who were
                    looking to their savings to get them through the tough times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, you left Latvia when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I left Latvia... Well, I've never left it in the sense that I keep going
                    back for prolonged stays, but as ambassador I left it in the summer of '95.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do in '95? I mean, what did you go back
                        to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Something extremely interesting and pleasant, an assignment as diplomat
                    in residence at the University of Chicago. It's a top-notch academic
                    institution, a great school, and the apartment we found in Hyde Park was within
                    walking distance from where Elizabeth grew up. And she got a job at the
                    university's School of Social Service Administration. So the assignment was
                    great for both of us. My main job was to recruit for the Foreign Service, to
                    talk to university students, not just at the University of Chicago and other
                    schools in the city but throughout the area -universities in Illinois,
                    Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan. So I did that. And I also taught a mini-course
                    and some seminars during the two years we spent in Chicago.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>But one big project during the first academic year was unexpected. Shortly after
                    we arrived in Hyde Park, I was contacted by a young man named John Papp from the
                    CIA, not the covert side but the overt analytical side. He asked if I would be
                    willing to help organize and chair a major international conference on the
                    Baltic States. You can probably guess from the mixed feelings I've expressed
                    about the role of the intelligence services in U.S. foreign policy that I felt
                    some hesitation at being the front man for something that was going to be
                    financed primarily by the Agency.</p>
                <p>But as I thought it over, it seemed to me there was a need for this conference.
                    Remember, this is only the fall of 1995 and the Baltic States are very far from
                    being integrated into Europe. They didn't join NATO and the EU until 2004,
                    almost a decade later. At this point they're still reeling from a half century
                    of Soviet occupation, it's not clear how long it will take them to modernize and
                    Westernize, and there is no consensus yet on whether it makes sense for them to
                    be brought into NATO. Even EU membership is not in the bag yet. I thought it was
                    important to maintain a high policy profile for the Baltic States. I was afraid
                    that now that they had regained their independence, U.S. policy interest would
                    flag, and the Balts still needed it. So I went ahead. I was able to get some
                    additional funding from DOD and turned the conference into a four-way
                    cooperation between the CIA, the Pentagon, the State Department and the
                    University of Chicago, where my base was the Harris School of Graduate Public
                    Policy Studies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the conference about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: It had a terrible title, Nation-Building in the Baltic States: Progress
                    and Prospects for Reform. Practically coma-inducing. We probably should have
                    incorporated the Baltic Tigers image, or the Mice that Roared, or The Tiny
                    Titans that Toppled the Soviet Empire. On the other hand, we were not trying to
                    appeal to a broad public. It was invitational - our goal was to assemble 60 to
                    80 of top officials, academics and other experts to swap ideas on the most
                    important problems that would have to be solved in order to integrate these
                    countries into the West - economic and political reforms, security relations,
                    ethnic relations, dealing with organized crime, and so forth. Since everybody
                    attending was well informed, the discussion took place at a high level of
                    sophistication. We also did an analysis of economic development using the
                    Agency's Factions methodology, which is a way of gaming policy dynamics.</p>
                <p>As you may know, Chicago is a major center of Lithuanian settlement in the U.S.,
                    so we had especially good representation from the Lithuanian side, including
                    former President Landsbergis and two future presidents, Valdas Adamkus and, if I
                    remember correctly, Dalia Grybauskaite. Toomas Ilves, who became president of
                    Estonia, was also there. Jack Matlock, former U.S. ambassador to the Soviet
                    Union, gave the keynote speech. This mixture of top experts made for fruitful
                    networking during the conference and was probably its main contribution.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get around the fact that it was being
                        sponsored in part by the CIA and the Department of Defense? I mean, in olden
                        days that would have been the kiss of death.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: And it would have been, I think, for many groups. But the Baltic States,
                    as I mentioned before, feel obligated to the U.S., and not just to soft power.
                    They are counting on American hard power to back their independence, so they and
                    their supporters are less squeamish about intelligence issues and military
                    connections. The fact that I was the front man and the honorary chairman may
                    have helped a bit. Whatever the case, attendance was high and CIA sponsorship
                    did not torpedo the conference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Russia portrayed? Was it the menace to the East or
                        was it seen as possibly a partner or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: No, it wasn't portrayed as a menace but it certainly was portrayed as a
                    potential problem. To do otherwise would be to be an idiot, frankly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. You know, other than that, how was the play, Mrs.
                        Lincoln? Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: It's a problem. I mean “problem” in the neutral sense, not in the
                    pejorative sense. Russia's a problem not only in that it's a big neighbor that
                    has invaded in the past but it is also the home country of hundreds of thousands
                    of people who now live in the Baltic States, and the question of how to
                    integrate them or deal with them is still a not entirely resolved question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then, what was your impression of the students that you
                        were meeting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Very high, frankly. Let's focus first on Chicago. Besides laying the
                    groundwork for the Baltic conference, which didn't take place until early May of
                    1996, I did a couple of other things in that first year. One was something you
                    could only do at a school like Chicago, where the students are very serious. I
                    offered a not-for-credit mini-course in seven 90-minute sessions titled “Shultz
                    at State: Inside U.S. Foreign Policy in the 1980's.” My text was a book by
                    George Shultz on his period as secretary of state.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Turmoil and Triumph.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Right. Basically written by Charlie Hill, whom I knew very well from
                    Vietnam and whom I invited to attend one of the sessions. It's a book well over
                    1,000 pages long, and I...</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've read it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I read it in carefully marked sections and prepared one-page synopses and
                    lists of issues for each session. The course was not for credit, so there was
                    little motivation for students to attend a course with such a blockbuster text,
                    but I had a good turnout. Students seemed to have read a good part of the
                    assigned text and one of them came up to me after and said, you know, this is
                    the most interesting thing that I've attended so far at this university. I
                    appreciated that. In addition to Charlie Hill, who had been Shultz' personal
                    assistant, I was also able to get Shultz' first deputy secretary, Ken Dam, who
                    by some twist of fate was teaching right next door at the law school, to be the
                    main presenter for one session. It was indeed an insiders' view of the foreign
                    policy process, as advertised.</p>
                <p>Shultz compared being Secretary of State to drinking from a fire hose, and that
                    is what my mini-course must have seemed like, even though the focus was not on
                    events but on the foreign policy process itself - on the way that the legal
                    authority and political power to make foreign policy is dispersed throughout
                    government and society, from the president and other members of the executive
                    branch to Congress to interest groups and lobbyists. As we know, even within the
                    executive branch there is often feuding, for example among State, Defense and
                    the NSC. Often physical proximity to the President is decisive, so the NSC
                    advisor has an edge. With all these hands grabbing for the ball, prospects for a
                    consistent, comprehensive foreign policy are vanishingly small. As a solution, I
                    toyed with the idea of shrinking the government and giving every cabinet member
                    an office in the Executive Office Building next to the White House, but of
                    course feuding within the executive branch is not the only problem.</p>
                <p>With our current government structure, about the only time our foreign policy is
                    consistent over time is when a powerful interest group takes it over. If our
                    Cuba policy is any guide, consistency is not always a good thing.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I also met with students at around ten or fifteen universities in the
                    region during my two years in Chicago, mostly during recruitment visits. Those
                    from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and the University of Wisconsin at
                    Madison were probably the brightest and most promising with respect to their
                    interest in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the '70s and all there was sort of a disdain for
                        working for the government as a carryover from Vietnam. How was it at your
                        time? Did you get any feel for that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>SILINS: When I was invited to speak about working for the State Department,
                    usually the turnout was very high, almost surprisingly high, with practically
                    full auditoriums at Madison, for example, where apparently there is a strong
                    tradition of overseas public service, including the Peace Corps. I found a high
                    level of interest almost everywhere and can't recall even one example where I
                    got a hostile '60s -style questioning or a repudiation of the Foreign Service.
                    But how many of those kids actually then applied to join the Foreign Service, I
                    really can't say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, but the idea is, you were getting a positive, at
                        least...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q:...response.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes, almost without exception, positive interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Being at Chicago, and of course this is in the heartland
                        of the Baltic migration to the United States in the early part of the
                        century, did you get involved at all in various Baltic American groups?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I did, yes. I did talk regularly to Baltic American groups. Lithuanians,
                    of course, are by far the most populous segment of the Baltic community in
                    Chicago. I spoke at the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations, I met with
                    newspaper people and probably did more public speaking than I've done in any
                    other assignment, and I enjoyed that once I got into the swing of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, for example, these groups, were they
                        replicating sort of the Cuban Americans and Irish Americans, being, you
                        know, more Catholic than the pope? I mean, sort of over-zealous about their
                        former nationality and all, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Now remember, we're in a different stage of the ballgame with the Baltic
                    Americans. Their home countries have regained independence, so they're no longer
                    in a state of panic about their very survival. The countries were not yet in
                    NATO, but they were on a firmer track to join the European Union. So the sense
                    of panic had receded. This kind of existential panic, panic about national
                    survival, I believe is part of the reason why, for example, those who really
                    care about Israel sometimes exceed reasonable bounds. They feel that their
                    country is encircled by intensely hostile enemies, and that's obviously true,
                    and therefore Israel's very existence is threatened. This brings out reactions
                    that can be extreme and even counterproductive.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>To find anything resembling that sort of attitude in the Baltic community you
                    have to go back a few years, when it looked as though it really might be the end
                    for the Balts as separate peoples, with the Latvians and the Estonians facing
                    the greatest threat. In the case of Latvia, the percentage of population that
                    was ethnically Latvian was sinking toward the 50 percent level and threatened to
                    go below it, which would make Latvians a minority in their own country. And they
                    felt, you know, this would be the end of their identity, the story's over. And
                    that caused some hyper reactions, for example the conviction that any move by
                    the U.S. that might even conceivably threaten the non-recognition policy must be
                    stopped at all costs. So some Latvian Americans opposed any contacts with
                    Latvia. They argued those would have to be mediated through the KGB and
                    therefore would serve the purpose of the enemy, and they didn't want any
                    contacts with officials in Latvia because that might imply U.S. recognition of
                    Latvia's incorporation into the Soviet Union. So I met up with a bit of that in
                    those days, in the pre-independence era. But it never really got to foaming at
                    the mouth, the Baltic extremism, as far as I know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, after your diplomat in residence time,
                        whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, the day after my retirement at the end of September 1997, I was on
                    a jet headed for Belgrade. This was not a part of Europe to which I had
                    previously been drawn, but the Department had asked me to join an OSCE team of
                    election observers to monitor the presidential election in Montenegro. After
                    reading books like Rebecca West's “Black Lamb and Grey Falcon,” it was hard to
                    say no. And the trip more than met my expectations. Montenegro had not been
                    damaged very much by the Balkan warfare that broke out after the breakup of
                    Yugoslavia, and it boasts spectacular landscapes and a fascinating population,
                    so the trip whetted my interest. Not much later, EUR/RPM asked me to sign on as
                    the deputy OSCE representative in Croatia. It looked as though my focus was
                    going to shift from the Baltics to the Balkans. But after hanging fire for a
                    month or two, the assignment to Croatia fell through.</p>
                <p>As I was wondering what to do next, my aunt in Latvia died. This may not seem
                    like a life-changing event, but it pulled me back to Latvia at a time when in
                    family terms things were at a decisive stage. I may have mentioned that when
                    Latvia regained independence, it adopted a policy of returning land and
                    buildings that had been nationalized by the Soviets to the former owners and
                    their descendants. As a result, my mother and my aunt had been given back what
                    had been my maternal grandparents' farm. It covered about 30 hectares, or 75
                    acres, and lay 25 miles east of Riga in the town of Ogre.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>I had kept hands off the process when I was ambassador and even afterward, so
                    management of the property had fallen to Aunt Margita, who was too old to move
                    to America and not in good health. Indeed, our main reason for getting the
                    property back was to create a source of income for her in her old age. Her death
                    made me the co-owner. As I looked into things after the funeral, it became clear
                    that the property would go down the drain unless I hired a new manager and spent
                    time in Latvia to put things back in order. I should mention that it was no
                    longer just farmland but was now part of a town of about 30,000, of which about
                    a fifth lived on our land in high-rise buildings which we did not own. That
                    complicated the management picture considerably.</p>
                <p>So beginning in about 1998, Elizabeth and I started spending almost half the year
                    in Latvia, with her enjoying it even more than I did. She started teaching
                    English as a second language and acquired a devoted following of students. I
                    became involved with a number of non-profit activities. For example, I helped to
                    found an anti-corruption organization called Delna, which is the Latvian chapter
                    of Transparency International, the global anti-corruption organization. I also
                    joined Rotary International through the newly founded Rotary club in Ogre. I
                    then worked at building bridges between the Ogre club and Rotary clubs in the
                    Washington D.C. area, starting with the Alexandria Rotary Club, as I went back
                    and forth between Latvia and the U.S. That led to support for the hospital in
                    Ogre and other Rotary projects.</p>
                <p>So I've been doing mostly pro bono work, including through the U.S. Baltic
                    Foundation, on whose board I have served for a number of years. We've recently
                    launched something we call “The Baltic Good Governance Initiative,” which is
                    meant to support Baltic non-profit organizations that promote integrity in
                    government and fight against corruption.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's called Delna, does that stand for anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Delna in Latvian means the palm of your hand. It refers to a Latvian
                    saying that means it's plain as the nose on your face, as open as the palm of
                    your hand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, openness; Glasnost. I have to be a little careful
                        about that or what we call transparency.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>SILINS: Right, transparency. That's the core issue that we support, transparency;
                    transparency in government, transparency in business. God knows, as we look
                    around the financial carnage around us, if there had been more transparency we
                    would have had less carnage, no question about that. If anything, I am more
                    energized now in this direction because it is clear that there is a role for
                    non-profits as a countervailing force to help mitigate these kinds of problems.
                    We have seen in the U.S. that government regulators did not do the job; and I
                    would argue, frankly, that because of potential conflicts of interest and other
                    mechanisms that lead to corruption, regulators cannot do the job alone. Just as
                    you cannot have a neighborhood that is peaceful, law abiding and orderly just
                    through the police. If the residents are unruly, don't trust each other and are
                    habitually violent, there is no way the police alone can handle that problem.
                    You have to have forces within the community itself in order to make it obey the
                    rule of law and make it orderly. Just force from the outside alone cannot do it,
                    no question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things I've seen as I've been doing these oral
                        histories now for almost 24 years is that there's been several trends. One
                        of course is just the gender mix, more and more women in the Foreign
                        Service. It's a much fairer organization. Also the minorities are coming in.
                        I mean, that sort of thing. But something that I think has been overlooked
                        but has happened is that when we both were in the Foreign Service
                        originally, non-governmental organizations were looked upon as being sort of
                        do-gooders and not very helpful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today the non-governmental organization has become a major
                        instrument, and the influence has been for the good; I mean, with some
                        problems, but basically for the good, and I think the State Department and
                        the Foreign Service has learned to live with them. I'm sure you found this
                        true in Latvia, didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes. Well, I mean I'm generally for non-governmental organizations, but
                    it's not really a question of whether you're for them or against them; they are
                    a reality. They are a part of the domestic policy scene and the foreign policy
                    scene and by no means are they all benign. I mean, there are some that are
                    radical and narrow-minded and there are others that are less so. It's all part
                    of a... well, in the shall we say scientific sense, a chaotic process which then
                    one has to try to regulate and channel in a constructive direction. I certainly
                    wouldn't endorse any group simply because it's a non-governmental one; you have
                    to weigh them one by one.</p>

                        beginning, and I think it's important to capture a period of time, and we're
                        talking now in March 2009 and there's been... it's really a Washington
                        issue, but the Charles Freeman, Chas Freeman episode, which has got both of
                        us enraged. I was wondering if you would put it in... what the issue is and

                <p>SILINS: Yes. I was indeed very upset about what happened to Chas Freeman, even
                    though I certainly can't call him a close friend. I did meet him fairly early in
                    my career; I forget, I think it was in the Vietnam context, but I haven't seen
                    him since... I think the last time was probably around 1993, this is a long time
                    ago now, when he was at the Pentagon as OSD/ISA, assistant secretary of defense
                    for international security; I was ambassador to Latvia at the time. Just
                    recently he had been picked by the new director for national intelligence to
                    head the National Intelligence Council.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Either February or March.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes. This is not an appointment which is subject to Senate confirmation;
                    it's not a policy-making position. The job of the chairman of the NIC, as I
                    understand it, is simply to try to bring some order into the product, the
                    intelligence output of the, what, I think roughly 16 intelligence agencies that
                    the U.S. is now blessed with. It's a job that I think Freeman would be
                    excellently suited for because he is a brilliant guy with a wide-ranging mind
                    and he is willing to entertain a broad range of ideas. But the news of the
                    appointment was leaked, and there ensued, mostly under the radar through the
                    Internet, through blogs and e-mails, sharp, hostile I would say, opposition to
                    him for a number of reasons. I think it's clear the main reason was that it was
                    thought by some that he might entertain some change in U.S. policy toward
                    Israel, which has been under the Bush Administration a policy of almost 100
                    percent support. I think, like many people, and Freeman has said this publicly a
                    number of times, it seems clear that this policy is not working. What's needed
                    is to step back, look at it, look at all of its elements, and see if there is
                    some other way that we can more successfully guarantee Israel's security in a
                    way that advances regional stability. But apparently even the notion that some
                    change might take place in U.S. policy is enough to arouse a firestorm, and
                    that's exactly what happened. Support, I'm sad to say, was elicited from people
                    like Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House. There was, I would call it a vicious
                    editorial in The Washington Post that surprised the heck out of me...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is what, about two or three days ago?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>SILINS: It was on March the 12th. Actually March the 12th, I'm embarrassed to
                    say, is the first day that I was even made aware of this whole thing. On March
                    the 12th there were three items in The Washington Post. As I say, I'm not close
                    to Chas Freeman and I'm not in the thick of foreign policy debate, but on March
                    the 12th The Washington Post, on the front page, printed a pretty neutral
                    account of the episode. It was by now already over; Freeman had withdrawn his
                    name from consideration. Nevertheless, on the Op Ed page there was a supportive
                    piece, a piece supporting Freeman as being just the right guy for the job and a
                    man of integrity, written by Dave Broder, the dean of political commentators. I
                    happen to know him, but from way, way back when I worked at the old “Washington
                    Star.” This is a very long time ago. But on the negative side was that hostile
                    editorial on the editorial page itself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well the editorial was, I found so out of... almost a
                        completely different style than a normal editorial. It seemed to be almost
                        frantic. I mean, it sounded odd.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I mean, I happen to be an admirer of Chas Freeman in
                        that I did an oral history with him and obviously I was dealing with a
                        genius. Now, he may be wrong on some things but basically he had probably
                        the most objective mind and organized mind of anybody I have ever
                        interviewed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: I'm sure that Chas Freeman is wrong on some things, as who isn't? There
                    is no one who is not wrong about some things. But he is brilliant; he has a
                    broad understanding of the kinds of issues that would be involved in trying to
                    bring some useful order to an intelligence output. By the way, in addition to
                    these other articles, there was yet another piece, on the 14th or 15th of March,
                    in The Washington Post, by Mark Lowenthal, who had been deputy chairman of the
                    National Intelligence Council. He wrote a piece saying, to my amazement, hey,
                    wait a minute, this is not even worth having an argument about; this whole thing
                    doesn't amount to a hill of beans. The whole intelligence process doesn't
                    work... and then he gave various examples, which amazed me because it was just
                    proof positive that the process needs to be fixed, and that's exactly what Chas
                    Freeman would be the best able to do.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>I agree with you about the tone. I seldom speak out on these issues, but I wrote
                    a letter to the chairman of The Washington Post Company, Donald Graham, who is,
                    I understand, actually personally in charge of editorial page content, and told
                    him that it sounded like the ranting of a hyper-caffeinated neo con. I think
                    that this is not just an issue of the character assassination of one of our most
                    distinguished diplomats, but this is really a free speech issue, and it has to
                    do with an attempt to impose a kind of political correctness on the foreign
                    policy debate that only is going to lead to damage to U.S. interests. In other
                    words, to prohibit the raising of certain issues without dire personal
                    consequence, and I think that's just bullying. It's not just a moral issue but
                    it leads to bad policy; it harms U.S. interests and I think also it is going to
                    harm Israeli interests. We need a wider, freer debate on all of this, and the
                    reason I am still upset about what was done to Chas Freeman is that he has been
                    made a public sacrificial victim to intimidate anyone else who might be willing
                    to speak up along the same lines as he has done. And I think that is
                    inadmissible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it rings a theme that runs through these oral
                        histories, and that has been the almost constant attack on “Arabists” by
                        what can only be described as the Israeli lobby, in that if you are an
                        Arabist and reporting on the Arab view of things, not in support of, but
                        reporting on the Arab side of the Israeli-Arab conflict that's gone since at
                        least 1948 to the present, that if you are reporting accurately on the Arab
                        side you therefore are anti-Semitic, and this has been a tool that has been
                        used really since the '40s on the Foreign Service and this is just another
                        iteration of this whole thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Well, I'm not an expert on the Middle East. I've never served there and
                    I... although I must say I did study it briefly, but only for two weeks when I
                    was in the Army Reserve; I was in a civil affairs unit and we spent the most
                    pleasurable summer camp that you could imagine at the Hopkins School of Advanced
                    International Studies studying the Middle East. This was back in the 1960s. For
                    what it's worth, my personal conclusion then was that there is no solution to
                    the Arab-Israeli problem because of insufficient common ground.</p>
                <p>But I would say a couple of things. First of all, one has to be very careful with
                    the use of the phrase “Israel lobby.” And I think even Chas Freeman in the last
                    few days has said that, well, maybe he oversimplified by blaming his demise on
                    the Israel lobby at large. What he meant by that, and I think what most people
                    mean when they say “Israel lobby,” is the most radical, closed-minded branch of
                    the pro-Israel forces. It's certainly not all Jews, because there is a broad
                    spectrum of opinion among American Jews and among Jews everywhere, including in
                    Israel, about what Israel should be doing, what Israeli policy should be, what
                    the U.S. should be doing for Israel. There is a very free-ranging debate. If you
                    read publications like, I don't know, The New York Review of Books, you might
                    find the most scathing criticisms of Israeli policy. But the point is that there
                    has been a so far successful effort to prohibit such debate by anyone anywhere
                    near the U.S. Government, whether it be the Legislative Branch or the Executive
                    Branch, and specifically people that have to do with foreign policy.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, and also one has to say that this, I don't know,
                        right wing or very pro hard line Israeli stand, has very strong support from
                        certain elements of the Christian religious right, you know, using the Bible
                        and that sort of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILINS: Yes, well I really don't have anything new on that, but there is another
                    thing I would like to add here. I was born in a small country surrounded by, in
                    fact annexed by, for quite a long time, most recently for half a century, by a
                    hostile neighbor. That's Latvia. Latvians have felt, and still to this day feel,
                    that their existence is by no means assured. Things could go to hell in a hand
                    basket very quickly. The Israelis, many of them, feel the same threat to their
                    existence, and rightly so. They are surrounded by countries that are very
                    hostile to them and which contain people, some of whom do not even acknowledge
                    Israel's right to exist. When you're in that frame of mind and you feel that
                    your whole nation and people could be wiped out, and particularly if you have
                    branded in your mind the memory of the Holocaust, which was truly one of the
                    most horrible things in human history, you fall into the survivalist mode of
                    thinking. And I've criticized this in Latvians who have less reason... well, I
                    won't say less reason, but who have maybe similar reasons for doing it. By the
                    survivalist mode, I mean that you have a very low level of trust in your
                    neighbors, you have very narrow horizons, you don't expect much from the future,
                    you feel you have to defend against anything that might threaten your interests,
                    you fall into a zero-sum way of thinking. In other words, any gain to your
                    potential enemies is a loss to you, therefore it must not be tolerated or even
                    discussed, which is why some Israelis feel so strongly against our talking to
                    people they consider terrorists and enemies, like Hamas for example, which I
                    think is a mistake. You've got to talk to them. You don't have to negotiate with
                    them in return for hostages, but you've got to talk to these people. So that's
                    where, I think, the need for a broader, freer debate on policy issues arises
                    here. It is a terrible mistake to force all of this underground; it has to be
                    brought into the open, and that's why I feel so strongly about what was done to
                    Chas Freeman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, just a footnote here, I refer people to the oral
                        history that I did with William Harrop, who was appointed as ambassador to
                        Israel during the early Clinton Administration, it was in '93, I guess, who
                        made a rather mundane remark about the United States not having money to
                        support everything and that Israel would have to be concerned about
                        generating money not just from the United States. And this aroused a very
                        minor little storm, but the Clinton Administration, brand new, unsure of
                        itself, worried about this so-called Jewish support, withdrew him. I mean,
                        it shows what happens. Israel in its actions and all has not been that
                        benign an influence in its part of the world.</hi>

                <p>SILINS: The Chas Freeman case may not be entirely behind us. There was a piece,
                    again in The Washington Post, a day or two ago by a member of their editorial
                    staff, Charles Lane, which tries to paint this episode as a defining moment not
                    just for Chas Freeman but for President Obama. Lane's argument is that now it's
                    time for Obama to come clean and show where he stands on this issue. In other
                    words, it's an attempt to trap Obama into declaring himself for 100 percent
                    support of Israel that will be very difficult to back out of in the rest of his
                    administration.</p>

                    to record my impressions of people and events, the sounds, smells and feel of

                <p>Saturday, May 1, 1993</p>
                <p>Ominous signs from Moscow, a return to the Big Lie. Yeltsin issued a press
                    release on April 25 accusing the Latvians of preparing for “ethnic cleansing.”
                    The next round of troop withdrawal negotiations was cancelled by the Russians
                    shortly thereafter. Now the Russian accusation is being circulated at the United
                    Nations. In the press, Deputy Foreign Minister Churkin menacingly (and falsely)
                    accuses the Latvians of rendering further withdrawal talks pointless by
                    unreasonably changing their negotiating stance, increasing their demands.
                    Painting the victim as the trouble-maker: it reminds one of the Hitler-Stalin
                    era. For the first time, these dark clouds on the eastern horizon stir in me a
                    tangible dread that events here could take an ugly turn. Of course, the mood
                    passes.</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>No storm clouds visible over Latvia this weekend. A warm, brilliant day. Trees,
                    shrubs and flowers all finally coming into bloom. E. and I drove to Tervete, the
                    ancient seat of Semigallian power. Wonderful hilly park with many paths, old
                    pines; woodpeckers, gurgling streams, storks. Tour of the writer Anna
                    Brigadere's house. Austere, handcrafted furnishings, very Swedish in feel. Cool
                    inside. The stone house sits by a stream next to the park. The caretaker, Liga
                    Klavina, is a woman bright with love for her work. She says the property will
                    soon revert to the son of Brigadere's publisher, who will maintain it as a
                    museum. Liga's father, now buried nearby, was a leading force behind creation of
                    the park, she said. It's lovely, evocative of ancient lives.</p>
                <p>Jacques de Beausse unfortunately must leave his post as French Ambassador here in
                    only two weeks, a consequence of an unusual pre-election decision by the French
                    Socialists to reassign 50 ambassadors. This move did nothing, of course, to
                    improve the Socialists' disastrous showing in the March elections. It's a shame;
                    Jacques and Jeanne-Marie have yet to move out of the Ridzene Hotel, where I also
                    spent nine months. They were to live eventually in the French Embassy, just down
                    the street from us on the other side of the school.</p>
                <p>Jacques' father was in the French Legation here during 1939-40, the last days of
                    Latvia's independence. Yesterday Jacques sent me a copy of his father's diary;
                    he is preparing it for publication in a dual French-Latvian edition. It deserves
                    the effort. Vivid descriptions, for example of the exodus of some 50,000 Baltic
                    Germans upon Hitler's order, news of which reached Riga on October 7, 1939,
                    erasing seven centuries of German Baltic history. Touching glimpses of life in a
                    Riga buffeted between two immense clashing evil forces.</p>
                <p>Sunday, May 2</p>
                <p>A morning walk around the city. Riga is busily putting on her spring dress of
                    leaves and flowers. Groups of adults and children in folk costume can be seen
                    strolling about, some singing as they go. Yet also everywhere in Riga you still
                    see rubble and decay that can only be described as the devastation of war — not
                    just the Second World War, but the Cold War, also fought on Latvian
                    territory.</p>
                <p>The central market is teeming even on Sunday, the range of goods on offer
                    constantly expanding. Kiwis, bananas, and mangoes are among the more exotic
                    offerings, not seen in public in the Soviet era. But many of the other goods on
                    offer were — shoes and shirts, odd bits of hardware, books and magazines,
                    plastic shopping bags from Russia and the Caucasus with lurid illustrations.
                    Russian is still the dominant language among the flea-marketeers that crowd the
                    open area, but Latvian is making headway in the giant former Zeppelin hangars. I
                    visit two of them, the meat and vegetable pavilions. Here you can buy good
                    chicken for 235 Latvian Rubles a kilo. That comes to about $1.80/kg, with the LR
                    now changing hands at 130 to the dollar. Of course, that is expensive to most
                    Latvians, with average salaries on the order of 8,000 LR/month and rents and
                    utilities no longer deceptively low as they were under the Soviet system.</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>Monday, May 3</p>
                <p>A very military day. Delegations from a number of European defense ministries are
                    meeting in Riga to share ideas on how to rebuild a defense structure after the
                    collapse of communism. Meantime, two of our own military delegations arrive, one
                    to set up our Military Liaison Team and the other to survey Latvian needs for
                    surplus military goods — non-lethal, of course — that we may be able to
                    offer.</p>
                <p>Vilis Krumins, the old “nationalist-communist” now director of the Nature Museum,
                    calls to say he has something important to tell me. I agree to see him on
                    Tuesday.</p>
                <p>Tuesday, May 4</p>
                <p>We meet in Krumins' gloomy little office at the Nature Museum on Krisjana Barona
                    street. He tries to cast doubt on Gorbunovs and Godmanis and to blame them in
                    advance for violence he suggests is likely to strike Riga on May 9. They're not
                    being tough enough, he says; they should ban “Den'” - the right-wing Russian
                    paper that regularly advocates violence to reclaim the Baltic. I find him
                    unconvincing. Krumins also questions the usual view of the 1950's Latvian
                    movement that tried to gain some local control over Soviet policy after Stalin's
                    death. Krumins says Berklavs is taking all the credit, but actually a lot of
                    non-communists were important in the movement too. It is not at all clear to me
                    what Krumins is after, but judging from his boast about all the journalists who
                    have been to see him recently, self-promotion may be one objective. He offers to
                    be of future service if needed.</p>
                <p>I call on Foreign Minister Andrejevs on instructions from Washington. Andrejevs
                    looks fit, thanks me for helping arrange a good reception for him in Washington.
                    Gaining confidence in the job, he responds well, with wit.</p>
                <p>E. and I stroll down Raina Boulevard to the farewell reception given by the de
                    Beausse. Crowded. Jacques gives a nice speech with a sardonic tribute to his
                    successor, “a specialist in Latin America personally selected by President
                    Mitterrand.” He tells me the embassy No. 2 will finish up work on his father's
                    journal. I ask where he and his father lived. He says it was on Elizabetes
                    street, perhaps number 13 — in any case, opposite that part of the park where
                    eventually the Central Committee building, now the International Trade Center,
                    was built in the Soviet period.</p>
                <p>Agriculture Minister Dainis Gegers loses a no-confidence vote. Latvian Investment
                    Bank President Ilze Jurkane resigns; reasons not clear, rumors abound.
                    Apparently the EBRD, a partner in the bank, is checking the books.</p>
                <p>Wednesday, May 5</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>General Johnson, Commander of NATO's northern forces, meets with NATO Ambassadors
                    in Riga at Kerstin Biering's cozy Danish Embassy in Old Town, the former English
                    Club and then Latvian PSR “Foreign Ministry.” Kerstin has given her own touch to
                    her office, where I remember meeting once or twice in the early 1980's with Nick
                    Neilands, then Deputy Foreign Minister. It looked different then; certainly the
                    feel of it was radically, utterly different then.</p>
                <p>Not to our surprise, the general says he found Latvian forces still at a very
                    basic level. (And, like me, took exception to the high-speed motorcade his
                    Latvian hosts insisted on whisking him about in.)</p>
                <p>Nico's grades arrive from Episcopal — pretty impressive, a 94.2 average for the
                    quarter. His advisor reports he is still detached from the school's social life,
                    though. His Civilization teacher's engaging comment suggests why: “Still tucked
                    back in the corner of the classroom, Nico continues to use this perch as vantage
                    point to shoot politically charged comments that drift out over the class and
                    upset the balance. He is a wonderful addition to a group that is somewhere right
                    of Attila the Hun.”</p>
                <p>Thursday, May 6</p>
                <p>I call on the Russian Ambassador, Aleksandr Rannikh, in his new embassy, recently
                    the Latvian Ministry of Culture — a very nice building if you don't mind that it
                    was from here that the appalling Vishinsky declared Latvia's incorporation into
                    the USSR. It is still sparsely furnished; Moscow is slow with funds, Rannikh
                    says. I assure him my embassy also is far from finished.</p>
                <p>With his beefy frame, round face and long black moustaches, Rannikh has an
                    uncanny resemblance to a walrus. He gamely defends Yeltsin's statements at the
                    start of our talk, accusing the Latvians of “provocations.” Eventually he admits
                    that points like those I have been making to him, about the need for Russia to
                    avoid verbal excesses like “massive human rights violations” and “ethnic
                    cleansing” and to take a more mature approach to Latvia, he has been trying to
                    make to Moscow himself, but without much success so far.</p>
                <p>Rannikh relates some of the difficulties of being a Russian ambassador to Latvia
                    these days. Trouble sometimes springs from unexpected quarters.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>First example. His press attach� is driving along a Riga street, Rannikh says,
                    when suddenly another car veers alongside, forcing him to stop. The other driver
                    accuses the press attach� of speeding; the press attach� denies it. The other
                    driver punches him. The police are called; so is the Russian Embassy. The
                    Russian consul arrives at the scene and protests the unauthorized detention of
                    the press attach�. The policeman takes the line that the other driver was simply
                    making a perfectly legitimate citizen's arrest of a speeder. As the argument
                    continues, the policeman, who like most of the former militsia is ethnically
                    Russian, takes the consul aside. “I'm Russian, you're Russian,” he tells the
                    consul. “But because of what Russia did to Latvia, you're not going to get any
                    help from me.”</p>
                <p>I tell Rannikh he must at least have obtained some relief from the Russian comedy
                    festival featuring Arkady Raikin that I noticed being advertised two weeks ago,
                    just opposite the Russian Embassy. Rannikh pulls another long face. He tells me
                    this comedy festival is held here each year because Arkady Raikin was born in
                    Riga, but this year it had a not-so-funny sequel. The festival coincided with
                    the Russian referendum of April 25, so Raikin and some of his comic colleagues,
                    a number of them also Jewish, came to the Russian Embassy to cast their votes.
                    To their surprise and horror, the throng of voters angrily turned on them,
                    shouting that Raikin and his kind represented the “Jewish mafia” that ruined
                    Russia and lost the Baltic Republics.</p>
                <p>Rannikh did not say so, but chances are the people who vilified Raikin would
                    apply the same epithet to Rannikh's boss, Foreign Minister Kozyrev. Figures
                    released by the Russian Embassy show that 80 percent of the Russian citizens who
                    came there to vote in the referendum (mostly retired military officers) cast
                    their ballots against Yeltsin and against reforms. It was the most negative
                    turnout on any former Soviet territory.</p>
                <p>I tell Rannikh about the rumors that violence might take place during the May 9
                    demonstrations. Rannikh says he does plan to lay a wreath at the “liberation”
                    monument in Pardaugava at 10 a.m., but he will make a quick withdrawal to avoid
                    being drawn into a “provocation” — still a favorite word, evidently, its meaning
                    not too clear. Rannikh promises to do his best to damp down tensions. He tells
                    me he does not expect real trouble.</p>
                <p>Saturday, May 8</p>
                <p>By car with E. to Bauska and Mezotne. Another beautiful day, bright and nearly 80
                    degrees. Spring plowing and planting well under way as we drive by. Some plowing
                    being done by machine, some by horse; much planting, especially of potatoes, by
                    hand, and a good deal of it by women in bathing suits.</p>
                <p>We picnic by the softly flowing Lielupe in the Mezotne park. Swans and storks,
                    fish jumping, children herding cows to fresh pasture across the river,
                    farmhouses tucked among flowering fruit trees. Arcadia Felix.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>On the way to our picnic site, we passed two memorial stones, one dedicated to
                    Red Army combat engineers who laid a pontoon bridge across the Lielupe River
                    under enemy fire on September 14, 1944. The other stone is dedicated to Latvians
                    deported in 1940... it doesn't specify where or by whom. Fresh red tulips lie on
                    both.</p>
                <p>At a wooden table overlooking the river near the markers, six young Russians I
                    would describe as “toughs” are having beer and loud conversation. Their presence
                    clashes with the spirit of the setting. We wonder how they see their future in
                    Latvia. Maybe that's what they're arguing about, but we're too distant to make
                    out their words.</p>
                <p>Sunday, May 9</p>
                <p>“Victory Day” passes peacefully in Riga. Thousands of Russians lay flowers at the
                    “Liberation” monument but no one tries to provoke violence. Latvian security
                    forces keep a low profile. It may be that even the Russian hot-heads don't want
                    to foul their nest here while Russia itself is in such sorry shape.</p>
                <p>After a visit to Aunt Margita, E. and I stop at the Central Market to buy some
                    Mother's Day flowers. Even late in the afternoon, it's still packed with buyers
                    and sellers.</p>
                <p>Tuesday, May 11</p>
                <p>The bitter taste of a negative prediction proved true. Just as I warned the
                    Department, when the embassy renovation crew began knocking out walls in what is
                    to become, over my objection, the consular section, cracks started appearing on
                    the floor above, including in our bedroom wall. These are 10-inch walls of brick
                    and mortar, so this is no trivial matter. I order a halt to demolition until a
                    structural engineer can assess the situation.</p>
                <p>Wednesday, May 12</p>
                <p>Jazz at the Embassy last night, a very successful concert by the Egils Straume
                    Trio in our spacious living room to an audience of over 60 people. We invited
                    mostly diplomats, bankers and businessmen since Egils is looking for
                    contributions to help replace the equipment stolen from him a few months ago,
                    equipment he needs to organize next year's music festival. Chilled champagne,
                    hors d'oeuvres, a warm spring night, the windows open on the park, good jazz....
                    Touchingly, two people tell us it was the best evening they've had in Riga. But
                    [our yellow Lab] Brio is desperately sick the next day, probably from too many
                    surreptitious treats.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>Moscow is taking an increasingly truculent tone toward Latvia and Estonia. With
                    Lithuania just admitted into the Council of Europe and Estonia about to be
                    despite Moscow's warning, Kozyrev cancels a planned visit to Strasbourg for the
                    spring parliamentary session. In the West, troubling signs of an inclination
                    toward appeasement, which I believe could inflame the situation.</p>
                <p>A good, relaxed birthday talk by telephone with Nico yesterday. His 16th, an
                    important one.</p>
                <p>Thursday, May 13</p>
                <p>A big conference on the economy at what used to be the (Soviet) Political
                    Education Building. It opens with an old Latvian documentary film dating from
                    about the thirties, but it could just as well be a Soviet product. Pistons
                    pumping, gears meshing, chimneys belching smoke, heroic workers striding toward
                    the camera whose lens is at knee level to make the sturdy proletarians tower
                    among the clouds.... Disquieting. It reminds one that some of what has been in
                    the deep freeze since the Soviets took over was put there when fascism had wide
                    appeal, and not just in Germany.</p>

                <p>The Russian Navy, what's left of it, is conducting exercises in the Latvian
                    economic zone, apparently with live fire on one day. The Latvians protest,
                    calling it an “unfriendly act.”</p>
                <p>The $400 million cement loan scandal continues to echo in the Latvian press. I
                    find it baffling that people could get suckered into such a blatantly
                    out-of-scale deal. How could anyone expect that a $400 million loan to Latvia,
                    whatever its purpose, could fail ultimately to get the closest scrutiny? On the
                    other hand, how could anyone believe that a German company which now is in
                    receivership, according to the German Ambassador, and may already have been at
                    the time the loan was being negotiated, could come up with that kind of
                    money?</p>
                <p>Sunday, May 16</p>
                <p>Yesterday morning a walk through the Ethnographic Museum where the air was
                    bright, soft and sweet with the fragrance of lilac and apple blossom.</p>
                <p>Last night with E. to Koknese, about an hour's drive upstream along the Daugava.
                    It was the closing ceremony of “Daugava Week,” a series of displays and
                    performances commemorating the ancient sites and events linked with the river
                    that winds through Latvia's heart. The finale was an explosion of fire on the
                    water, symbolizing the birth of a new sun to give strength to the Latvian
                    people. Simultaneously, fireworks burst from the ruins of the Koknese
                    fortress.</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>The castle sits at the confluence of the Perse and the Daugava. It used to tower
                    far above the river. Now, after the Plavinas hydroelectric station was built,
                    water laps its walls. Even today it is a beautiful site but when we spoke to
                    those who knew it as it was, their eyes clouded with sorrow and anger at the
                    loss. Latvian protest over the Plavinas HES, I was told, was one of the key
                    events that led to the subsequent purge of “bourgeois nationalists” from the
                    Latvian Communist Party.</p>
                <p>At this moment I'm sitting in the car at the edge of a beautiful marsh, Kanieris,
                    near the settlement called Antinciems. The marsh is reminiscent of the bird
                    refuge at Chincoteague. Gulls are making a tremendous racket in the distance.
                    Closer by, a fairly large animal occasionally splashes around in the water among
                    the reeds but I can't make out what it is. There's a light, pleasant drizzle. A
                    serious fisherman moves off at my arrival. It's past noon, so he's probably been
                    here for some time. Later, some young boys on bicycles come up to fish at the
                    same place.</p>
                <p>A tractor passes pulling a wagon with long rough-cut planks sticking out every
                    which way from the back. Later, as I drive along the dirt road in the direction
                    from which the tractor came, I find he's been losing one plank about every 20
                    meters for a kilometer. That kind of numb-minded carelessness was a trademark of
                    the Soviet work ethic; it apparently survived the collapse of the empire. For
                    how long?</p>

                    Committee Chairman Peteris] Simsons says. Defense Minister Jundzis tells me
                    that, after two delays, Russian Defense Minister Grachev has promised to meet
                    the Baltic Defense Ministers tomorrow in Vilnius. Jundzis says with a smile he
                    has been allotted a half hour, beginning at 11 a.m.</p>

                <p>A Latvian TV special on Imants Ziedonis, the only man in Latvia about whom I will
                    say: I love him and admire him. He says he's not sure about his life, what he
                    has accomplished. He is not, as the French saying goes, at ease within his skin.
                    But more than anyone, almost despite himself, he stands for much of what is best
                    about Latvia.</p>
                <p>Saturday, May 22</p>
                <p>On the way to Kuldiga, near Sabile, I spot a sign pointing into the woods to
                    “Maras Kambari.” Intrigued, we turn down a sandy road into the woods, eventually
                    leave the car and walk along a path high above the Abava River that leads
                    through the Forest Primeval to the “chambers,” sandstone caves in a gorge.</p>
                <p>At Kuldiga, while E. explores the town, I sit in the sun with book and binoculars
                    at an overlook on the cliff above the broad falls of the River Venta. It's
                    called “Kuldigas Rumba.” Upstream are the falls, downstream rapids and the Roman
                    arches of the stone bridge spanning the river. The scene is reminiscent of
                    America in the 40's or 50's — kids shooting the rapids on a large inner tube,
                    others swimming, splashing and fooling around near the falls. Three boys, wading
                    up to their armpits, are doing some serious fishing in the frothy water below
                    the falls. It's windy; gulls wheel and soar above the patch of reeds upriver,
                    catching insects. A slim, quiet Latvian boy, perhaps eight, adds himself to our
                    company. E. gives him a cold ginger ale, I let him look through my binoculars.
                    He wears a baseball cap with the slogan, “PHIL'S AUTO REPAIR - IF WE CAN'T FIX
                    IT, IT AIN'T BROKE.”</p>
                <p>Sunday, May 23</p>
                <p>It hasn't rained for weeks. The City Canal opposite the Embassy is low, sluggish
                    and a dull dark sewer-brown. I walk upstream to where the canal enters from the
                    Daugava, to see whether it would help if more water were pumped in during dry
                    spells. Unfortunately, probably not. Where it feeds into the canal, near the
                    Central Market, the Daugava itself is low, sluggish and the same unappetizing
                    brown.</p>
                <p>Then to the Liberation Monument in Pardaugava, a long walk. Dedicated to those
                    who fought on the Soviet side in 1941-1945, it was too big to remove without a
                    fuss promptly after independence, as the Lenin statue was, and is still the
                    focus for gatherings of the faithful, as on May 9. But it is getting noticeably
                    shabbier as brass is pilfered and slabs of marble peel off.</p>
                <p>On the far side of the monument, where the tall tower and its platform are
                    three-quarters surrounded by a moat, the large brass numbers that remain now
                    read:</p>
                <p>1 9 4 1 * 9 4</p>

                <p>Petty theft or prophecy? Is this some die-hard Russian's prediction that the
                    decisive battle for Riga will be fought next year?</p>
                <p>Wednesday, May 26</p>
                <p>Premiere of the film “Buris” (Cage) at the Reitern House. Based on the book by
                    Alberts Bels but with a great deal of interpolation by the director/producer,
                    Ansis Epners. A very depressing film, unfortunately made several years too late.
                    It tells the lunatic tale of a man whose own brother locks him up in a cage
                    hidden away in the woods. If it had been released during the Soviet era, it
                    would have been applauded as a courageous indictment of the Soviet occupation —
                    as Bels' book was. Today, few want to subject themselves to the raw, grinding
                    prison mood of that era. A shame, since the film is superbly photographed, with
                    good acting by Ivars Kants in the lead role.</p>
                <p>For hostages after their release, it can be therapeutic and even necessary to
                    retell the experience of captivity; that does not guarantee it will be
                    entertaining for their audience. I fear “Buris” will land with a thud at the
                    festivals.</p>
                <p>At last the dry spell has broken. Rain last night and some more today, with much
                    cooler temperatures. I hope the same is true all over the country.</p>
                <p>Saturday, May 29</p>
                <p>To Jurmala, or more precisely Melluzi, for lunch at the summer house Frances and
                    [British Ambassador] Richard Samuel are renting. On the edge of the pine woods,
                    it turns out to have a lovingly tended garden and lots of cosy corners and
                    vine-enclosed nooks. Sirka and [Finnish Ambassador] Antti Lassilla, Torbjorn
                    Aalbu and [Lutheran Minister] Arden and Janna Haug fill out the company. An
                    implacably sharpening earache eventually drives Janna from the table, and we
                    head back to Riga for a doctor.</p>
                <p>Sunday, June 6</p>
                <p>Just back from the Press Ball, which Elizabeth and I left at the shockingly early
                    hour of 11 p.m. More professionally arranged, it lacked some of the naive
                    excitement we felt at last year's, the first to be held in newly independent
                    Latvia.</p>
                <p>Today is the second and final day of elections. In Riga and the outlying
                    precincts that I visited by car, the voting was taking place in a quiet and
                    businesslike way with little stir to reveal that anything remarkable was going
                    on. The only unusual event was a small demonstration by a few hundred Russians,
                    mostly pensioners, complaining about not being able to vote.</p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>Monday, June 7</p>
                <p>The early returns show a plurality for Latvia's Way, the “best and brightest of
                    East and West” ticket, with Gorbunovs and Meierovics at the top. It wins about
                    32 percent of the votes, which translates to about 36 seats in the 100-seat
                    Saeima. Next is the Latvian Independence Movement (LNNK), but they have less
                    than half the votes of Latvia's Way, followed by Janis Jurkans' Concord for
                    Latvia, the Farmers' Union, the Christian Democrats, the Democratic Center, For
                    Fatherland and Freedom, and Equal Rights.</p>
                <p>Poor Godmanis; the Popular Front is well below the 4% threshold, so he doesn't
                    even get into the Saeima. Perhaps it's just as well, but I sympathize with him.
                    I send him a letter and a biography of fellow physicist Richard Feynman,
                    “Genius,” to cheer him up.</p>
                <p>Wednesday, June 9</p>
                <p>With Imants Ziedonis to visit some of the “sacred oaks” that he and his merry
                    band started to preserve some 15 years ago. Near Seja he shows us perhaps the
                    biggest oak in Latvia, whose trunk it takes nine persons to span with their
                    arms. It is about 800 years old, they say. The trunk is completely hollow; a
                    hole has been cut in it in preparation for preservation work. I step inside. A
                    strange sensation, like being in a savage cathedral. The hollow reaches all the
                    way to the top, where you can see the sky through a large opening.</p>
                <p>Saturday, June 12</p>
                <p>Liepaja, city of lindens. A heartbreaking place, full of parks, trees and
                    terribly run down old houses. For a long time it was a closed city, the preserve
                    of the Soviet Baltic Fleet, and even the beaches were raked every evening to
                    record the footprints of those entering or departing illegally by sea. The
                    mayor, Imants Vismins, tells me when he was in his teens, he and his friends
                    used to go for illicit swims at night, backing carefully into the water and then
                    walking normally when they exited again, leaving many footprints in the sand
                    mysteriously coming from the sea to baffle the Soviet guards.</p>
                <p>Peter the First and Charles XII, great enemies, both lived here for a time. It
                    strikes me that the people, Russified though the city is, have a very Western
                    look and move at a brisk pace. It's Latvia's rock music capital. This truth is
                    drilled into us as rock music blares out all night from just below our hotel
                    windows, robbing us of sleep.</p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>The Russians have done a lot to be ashamed of here, and they're not departing in
                    style. There are still 128 ships in Liepaja's military harbor, but what's
                    shameful is the number that are sitting on the bottom, both surface vessels and
                    submarines. I'm on board the Gallatin, a Coast Guard cutter paying the first
                    U.S. ship visit since Latvia disappeared behind the Iron Curtain. From the
                    bridge, we can see two submarines grounded, at an advanced stage of
                    dismantlement, one with only the conning tower above water. Behind us is a
                    once-formidable guided missile cruiser, the Bezobrazniy, being transformed into
                    junk, but at least it's still afloat.</p>
                <p>Thursday, June 24</p>
                <p>To Valmiera yesterday for Jani — St. John's Eve, or Midsummer — on an outing
                    organized for the diplomatic corps by the Foreign Ministry. We began with a tour
                    of the Valmiera Church, then to a newly privatized farm to make the acquaintance
                    of their cows, sheep and goats, and a very lovable kitten. They served the
                    traditional midsummer snack: piragi, cheese, freshly brewed beer. Then to a
                    lakeside restaurant/dacha, also brand new, for lunch. Rannikh and I rode a
                    large, spirited horse up and down a few turns. For me, it was the first time on
                    horseback in twenty-some years. The climax of the evening was to have been an
                    outdoor concert attended by over 30,000 — Zinge-93. There were some engaging
                    performers, but for the most part it was loud, even raucous, and we were
                    uncomfortable sitting on the ground. We left after about three hours, taking our
                    time driving back to Riga through the lush midsummer countryside.</p>
                <p>While stopped by the roadside to take pictures of a field with haystacks, I was
                    greeted by a woman I knew riding by on a bicycle. She invited us to her new
                    country house, where she, her husband and two children were spending Jani. So we
                    had a genuine Latvian midsummer night after all.</p>
                <p>Friday, June 25</p>
                <p>The bluster from Moscow, especially against Estonia, is now much sharper.
                    Yesterday Yeltsin put out a statement containing the following appalling
                    language:</p>
                <p>"... it seems that the Estonian Government has misjudged Russia's goodwill and,
                    giving way to the pressure of nationalism, has 'forgotten' about certain
                    geopolitical and demographic realities. The Russian side has means at its
                    disposal to remind Estonia about these.”</p>
                <p>This is not all. Foreign Minister Kozyrev, his deputy Churkin and other Russian
                    officials have also jumped into the fray, indicating a coordinated attack. To
                    its credit, Washington has already fired off a demarche to Moscow asking for
                    clarification “at the highest appropriate level” of the Yeltsin statement.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>The Russians making these statements are reported to be fired with sincere
                    outrage. No doubt. The root cause, it seems to me, is the lingering ignorance of
                    contemporary history in Russia. As Aleksandr Rannikh admitted to me, even many
                    Russians in Latvia don't know what Russia did to the Baltic people. Most
                    Russians seem to consider themselves either victims of the Soviet regime and/or
                    heroes who helped topple it, thereby liberating the Balts. They naturally are
                    outraged at the impudence of Estonians and Latvians for presuming to deny
                    citizenship and other privileges to any Russians. Even military officers and
                    their families are immune from eviction because the Russians refuse to consider
                    that they were ever an army of occupation.</p>
                <p>One can sense a natural tendency among Western policymakers to lean on the Balts
                    in order to placate the Russians. I fear this course of action will exacerbate
                    the problem by spurring the Russians on to bullying that will provoke the Balts
                    to violence. Alternatively, and in fact more probably, the Russians will stage
                    the violence themselves to excuse the show of force for which they have already
                    rhetorically set the stage. Diminishing the West's leverage for dealing with
                    this disturbing scenario is the economic recession and lack of clear leadership
                    that has already caused the vaunted Western assistance package for Russia, at
                    least the $4 billion privatization fund, to shrink embarrassingly in the past
                    few days.</p>
                <p>Saturday, June 26</p>
                <p>As Nico and I return from a bike ride around Pardaugava, to my surprise
                    Hans-Peter Furrer, Political Director of the Council of Europe, turns up. He and
                    Lynn Davies arrived in the middle of the night from Tallinn. Their visit there
                    was only coincidentally related to Estonia's crisis with Moscow; it had been
                    scheduled two weeks earlier but the timing was right to offer a COE “expertise”
                    of the Estonian “Foreigners' Law” that has Moscow so upset. Peter says it was
                    decided after [COE Secretary General] Catherine Lalumiere's recent Washington
                    visit to have more “on the spot” meetings between U.S. and COE officials — of
                    which this is one. This also explains why Heiner Klebes, Clerk of the COE
                    Parliamentary Assembly, called me yesterday to say he will be in Riga July 5-8
                    and would like to see me. It's good to see old friends from Strasbourg. Nico
                    takes the opportunity to send along some letters to his friends.</p>
                <p>Sunday, July 4</p>
                <p>Latvia has been having a party for two weeks, with the midsummer celebration
                    merging into the song and dance festival that ends tonight. We added our
                    contribution with a July 4 cookout/reception held in splendid weather by the
                    shore of the Baltic at the Hotel Dzintars, under the pines. A great success.</p>
                <p>Last night we went to the closing performance of the dance festival. A stubbornly
                    persistent drizzle failed to dampen the spirits of the dancers or the audience.
                    Lovely girls in long woolen skirts that stand out like bells when they twirl,
                    the young men mostly in light grey and tan wool, many wearing tall broad-brimmed
                    black hats that give good protection from the rain.</p>

                <p>Tuesday, July 6</p>
                <p>First session of the Saeima, Latvia's first truly freely elected parliament since
                    the Soviet occupation. Two deputies are missing: Alfred Rubiks, the former
                    Communist party leader, who is in jail; and Joachim Siegerist, the German
                    rightist, who makes a show of “not wanting to sit next to former communists”
                    (Anatolijs Gorbunovs was elected Speaker).</p>
                <p>Thursday, July 8</p>
                <p>Senators Phil Gramm and John McCain arrive for a lightning visit, just in time to
                    be the first foreigners to call on newly inaugurated Latvian President Guntis
                    Ulmanis. Ulmanis makes a good impression, a bit rough-hewn and lacking English
                    but unpretentious and straightforward. My guess is he has a firm backbone and
                    will be an activist president.</p>
                <p>Friday, July 9</p>
                <p>After a working visit to Cesis, where we also see our National Guard giving
                    training in first aid to the Latvian Home Guards, we continue on toward
                    Valmiera. On Lake Vaidava we stay at a newly built guest house overlooking the
                    water. Nico, Kate and Brio are also along. Lovely weather; we swim, boat, walk.
                    Nico and I fish industriously and with pleasure but totally without results.</p>
                <p>Friday, July 16</p>
                <p>Bill Luers, now President of New York's Metropolitan Museum, comes through Riga
                    with a delegation of Directors from Scudder's New Europe Fund. Elizabeth and I
                    lunch with Bill and Wendy at the Tower Restaurant. We discuss the
                    Estonian-Russian tension — a “referendum” is being conducted by the Russians in
                    the Narva area on autonomy. Bill is active in various foreign policy projects;
                    agrees no one is focusing on how to restrain Russia, other than buying good will
                    through Western assistance. He proposes I give a presentation at the Council on
                    Foreign Relations when I return for consultations in September, suggests we
                    invite George Kennan to visit Riga.</p>
                <p>Saturday, July 17</p>
                <p>Off in the car with E. with the intent of finding a nice place for a walk along
                    the Gauja River near Sigulda. But several attempts to follow small roads down to
                    the river fail us. We return to the public area below Turaida Castle, where we
                    rent a rowboat and picnic on the river.</p>
                <p>Sunday, July 25</p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>Yesterday a torrent of rain soaked Riga, flooding Raina Boulevard. The wind drove
                    water through many of our windows. In the meantime, the renovation work is
                    reaching a crescendo. For the past two weeks, clouds of dust and smoke have been
                    rising into our apartment from below. This week some 100 20-foot steel piles are
                    being driven in a rectangle by the Embassy's southwest corner as the workers
                    prepare to excavate a giant pit to bury fuel tanks for the emergency generator.
                    The vibrations cause huge cracks to appear above the window in my office and in
                    the consular section below. Yesterday as I was looking out our bedroom window, a
                    fir tree collapsed in the wind, its roots having been severed by construction
                    work. I'm worried about the large trees on the other side; the piles are being
                    driven only ten feet from their trunks but their roots are cut off by the
                    workers even closer to the tree as they prepare to sink the piles. The soil is
                    very sandy, unstable; the cracks in the Embassy may be due to further settling,
                    not just vibration.</p>
                <p>Thursday, July 30</p>
                <p>E. departs for Washington, to stay at the Ludingtons' house, where Nico, Kate,
                    Matthew and perhaps Lucas will progressively gather. I will join them August
                    18.</p>
                <p>Friday, July 30</p>
                <p>A human skeleton turns up near the southeast corner of the Embassy as the workers
                    dig a trench for fuel lines. The body was buried in a sitting position with the
                    hips below the skull. We inform the police, who prepare a report and take
                    possession of the skull. It appears to be quite old; not a recent crime, in any
                    case.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the southwest section of the Embassy, which has obviously settled in
                    past years, is now visibly sinking again, its new decline prompted by the
                    digging of the large pit for the fuel tanks. Cracks multiply above the windows
                    and the outer wall. In the consular section, bricks and plaster start to fall.
                    Much work will be needed to repair the damage once the building is stabilized.
                    The renovation team resolves to work through the weekend to bury the fuel tanks
                    as quickly as possible.</p>
                <p>I meet with Ojars Kehris, now Economics Minister. He says it will take two or
                    three weeks more to get the new government structures organized and then focus
                    on how to implement the development plan outlined in the “Latvia 2000”
                    proposal.</p>

                <p>To Sigulda for an opera recital in the ruins — not the Turaida palace, but on the
                    near side of the Gauja River. It was successful beyond my expectations. The
                    soloists were three Latvians who perform mostly abroad — Inese Galante, Ingus
                    Petersons, and Egils Silins — and one whose principal foreign journey was to
                    Siberia courtesy of Joseph Stalin — Janis Sprogis. They did Bizet, Mozart,
                    Puccini, Verdi, Tchaikovsky... Mostly familiar arias but performed with great
                    talent, all the more touching because it was offered as a gift to the Latvian
                    people, since I doubt the performers were paid anything worth mentioning. The
                    weather cooperated, in fact contributed to the drama, with rain threatening off
                    and on and finally, as though also obedient to the conductor's baton, sprinkling
                    in earnest right after the closing aria.</p>
                <p>Sunday, August 8</p>
                <p>To Mezciems, on the coast north of Riga, for two hours of sun, sand and
                    solitude.</p>
                <p>Wednesday, August 11</p>
                <p>Margaretha af Ugglas, now Swedish Foreign Minister, pays a lightning visit to
                    Riga; mostly, I think, to explore how the CSCE can help avoid a Narva-like
                    crisis here. We talk briefly at the Parliament building between her meeting with
                    Gorbunovs and her closing press conference. I express some reservations about a
                    CSCE presence along Estonian lines in Latvia; I fear it may exacerbate the
                    situation rather than calming it.</p>
                <p>Thursday, August 12</p>
                <p>President Guntis Ulmanis is impelled by his own history (Siberian exile as an
                    infant) and the pressure of his constituents to seek redress from Russia for
                    Soviet wrongs. I tell him it is not enough to be right, to win the legal
                    argument; that won't bring the West to Latvia's rescue should Russia turn ugly.
                    Better to learn what one can from Finland's example. The important thing now is
                    to get the rest of the troops out.</p>
                <p>Monday, August 16</p>
                <p>The second day of a visit by Admiral Paul Miller, CINCLANT/SACLANT; he is here in
                    his NATO role. A very engaging and thoughtful commander. He sees peacekeeping as
                    the centerpiece of military activity for the near term. He tells me he expects,
                    in his CINCLANT role, to be given command of all U.S. forces (with exceptions
                    such as MAC, SAC, etc.). He is also urging a statutory change of the interagency
                    process used to reach decisions on the employment of U.S. military force; the
                    present one is inadequate and only worked by luck during Desert Storm, he
                    maintains.</p>

                <p>Above the Baltic aboard an Antonov AN-24 of Latavio, the Latvian airline. A
                    hand-me-down from the all too recent Soviet era, the aircraft smells
                    depressingly of stale sweat and vibrates furiously, but aside from having two
                    bald tires it seems up to the task of getting me to Helsinki, where I will catch
                    a flight to New York and then Washington. The sea below is that odd green that
                    Joyce named so unforgettably in Ulysses.</p>
                <p>Thursday, August 19</p>
                <p>In Washington, at the Ludingtons' house near the Cathedral. I spend a long
                    morning in bed with toast, coffee and The Washington Post, to get the flavor of
                    life in America. From Page One:</p>
                <p>The lead article - “Judge Lets Girl Sever Birth Ties” - recounts the decision by
                    a court in Sarasota, Florida to deny the biological parents of a 14-year-old
                    girl, Kimberly, visitation rights or any further contact with her. A hospital
                    had mistakenly given Ernest and Regina Twigg another baby in place of Kimberly
                    shortly after birth. “I want them out of my life,” Kimberly said of the Twiggs.
                    County Circuit Judge Stephen Dakan agreed she has the right to make that
                    choice.</p>
                <p>“In Kidnap Pit, Mind Over Matter” tells of a kidnapped man's struggle to survive
                    in a pit nine and a half feet deep and about five feet wide just off the Henry
                    Hudson Parkway on Manhattan's Upper West Side, where he was held 12 days for
                    ransom. Harvey Weinstein credited Marine training and Koestler's Darkness at
                    Noon with helping him maintain his mental balance. Following his release, he
                    told the press: “I live in the greatest city in the world. I am proud to be a
                    New Yorker, and what happened to me in the last 12 days just redoubled my
                    pride.”</p>
                <p>Still on Page One: “Examiner Says P.G. Man Shot in Back” covers the fatal
                    shooting in Prince Georges County, Maryland of Duane Void by an off-duty
                    District policeman, Kenneth Milling. The incident was triggered when Milling's
                    pit bull and Void's German Shepherd got into a fight. Void hit the pit bull with
                    two rounds from a .25 caliber semiautomatic handgun. The policeman fired eleven
                    rounds with his Glock 9mm pistol, three of which hit Void. Milling evidently
                    would have fired more, but his gun jammed. Police said there was not enough
                    evidence to arrest Milling; they are turning the case over to the state's
                    attorney for presentation to a grand jury.</p>
                <p>That these three items appear on the front page of the leading newspaper in our
                    nation's capital is only partly explained by the fact that this is August and
                    both the Congress and the President have left town.</p>
                <p>Saturday, August 21</p>
                <p>Reading a magazine article, I come across this quotation from Cavafy:</p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>When you start on your journey to Ithaca, then pray that the road is long, full
                    of adventure, full of knowledge.... Always keep Ithaca fixed in your mind. To
                    arrive there is your ultimate goal. And if you find her poor, Ithaca has not
                    defrauded you. With the great wisdom you have gained, with so much experience,
                    you must surely have understood by then what Ithacas mean.</p>
                <p>Indeed I found her poor and I did feel defrauded. Experience I have; it is wisdom
                    I must seek.</p>
                <p>Sunday, September 26</p>
                <p>New York. President Clinton's limousine, preceded by a staggering number of
                    motorcycle police and other vehicles, passes me at Fifth Avenue and 63d as I am
                    walking back to the Barbizon Hotel a little after 7 pm. There are two identical
                    cars flying the American flag; he is in the second.</p>
                <p>It is the closest I am likely to get to the President this trip. The President
                    will meet tomorrow with the three Baltic Presidents, but his own ambassadors are
                    not invited to the meeting. I came back to New York anyway, having other things
                    to do. The most important is a meeting with George Kennan, set for 4 pm Tuesday
                    at the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>
                <p>Tuesday, September 28</p>
                <p>A brilliant day in Central Park, cool and clear, so welcome after three days of
                    enervating heat and moisture. I find a spot by the fountain near the boathouse
                    to take the sun and read Anatol Lieven's The Baltic Revolution, a provocative
                    book that would have benefited from editing — at the price of becoming less
                    interesting, of course.</p>
                <p>In the afternoon, first a meeting at the Waldorf with, on the Latvian side,
                    President Ulmanis, Foreign Minister Andrejevs, and Ambassador to the U.S.
                    Kalnins. The American principals are Strobe Talbott and Nick Burns. Ulmanis and
                    Andrejevs, who have just received a report on the latest sessions of
                    Latvian-Russian troop withdrawal talks, focus on the Skrunda early-warning
                    radar, which the Russians say they need to hold on to for another ten years.
                    Ulmanis says that, again, the Russians maintain there is an understanding
                    between them and the U.S. government that supports their continuing claim to the
                    radar. Talbott and Burns categorically deny any such “understanding,” saying the
                    decision on what agreement to strike with Russia on Skrunda is entirely up to
                    Latvia.</p>
                <p>On to the Council on Foreign Relations, at 58 East 68th Street. Kennan arrived
                    promptly, marvelously fit and alert for a man almost 90. He walks carefully and
                    carries a cane and he told me one ear isn't much good, but his eyes are bright
                    and his mind is sharp. I doubt I'll be as fit when I'm 70, should I live that
                    long.</p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>We talked for an hour, first about Kennan's life in Riga, of which I knew the
                    outlines from his Memoirs. When I asked if Russia would respect Baltic
                    independence, Kennan without hesitation gave an optimistic reply. Russia, he
                    said, had already given up the Baltic littoral at the beginning of the Soviet
                    period; it was only Hitler that brought the Russians back. Nor did he think it
                    likely that too much Baltic success, economic or otherwise, would attract
                    Russian aggression; rather, Russia would seek to emulate it.</p>
                <p>Kennan was worried, however, about a tendency he had witnessed during his own
                    time in Riga of the Latvians taking too narrowly ethnic a view and shrinking
                    their horizons, for example by insisting on the sole use of the Latvian
                    language. (He mentioned as one minor but revealing example that opera programs,
                    previously in French, came to be distributed only in Latvian). Kennan was not,
                    as I had surmised from his memoirs, overly charmed by Latvians during his tour.
                    It was the “saving grace” of Riga, he said, that it also had a rich store of
                    German, Russian and Jewish culture to draw on.</p>
                <p>I invite Kennan back to Riga, perhaps in connection with a summer trip to Norway,
                    which he still takes regularly. He thanks me but says his age does impose limits
                    on what he can undertake.</p>
                <p>In the evening, to the Hotel Pierre for the annual Appeal of Conscience awards
                    dinner. Speakers are Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev and Strobe Talbott. One of
                    the recipients, Aleksey II, Patriarch of Russia, has left New York early in an
                    attempt to mediate the worrisome power struggle between Yeltsin, his former Vice
                    President Rutskoy, and the Russian parliament.</p>
                <p>Monday, October 4</p>
                <p>Riga. This morning we watch television in amazement as tank shells slam into
                    Moscow's White House, seat of Russia's retrograde, deluded parliament. Yeltsin,
                    rallying the military to his side, has decided that enough is enough;
                    Khasbulatov and Rutskoy, by calling for mob assaults on the Ostankino TV
                    station, have exceeded all reasonable bounds. The hitherto peaceful standoff
                    around the White House turns into a bloody assault. Flames and smoke pour out of
                    the windows, blackening the upper floors of the huge white building. Soon the
                    renegade parliament surrenders. Rutskoy and Khasbulatov, having received
                    guarantees through two embassies that they will not be shot, file as prisoners
                    from the burning building.</p>
                <p>The spectacle of an armored attack by the executive branch on the legislature in
                    the heart of Moscow is too bizarre to be real. I feel an odd sense of
                    detachment. Apparently many Muscovites felt that way, too. As the tanks and
                    soldiers drew up to encircle the White House and prepare their assault, women
                    with shopping bags and men with briefcases continued to walk calmly through
                    their lines, seemingly oblivious to this epochal struggle for Russia's political
                    soul.</p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>In Riga, people are nervous but not panicky; there are no demonstrations. Once
                    Yeltsin's victory is clear, the chief worry here is about what Yeltsin may have
                    had to promise the military to win their support — and what that will mean for
                    Russia's policy toward the Baltic States.</p>
                <p>One indicator of confidence here is the currency exchange rate. Despite the
                    crisis, the lat strengthens slightly, going from $1.62 to $1.63. In Moscow, on
                    the other hand, the ruble, which had firmed somewhat after dropping well below
                    1000 to the dollar, takes another downward dip.</p>
                <p>Saturday, October 9</p>
                <p>Elizabeth, my mother and I spend most of the afternoon with former foreign
                    minister Janis Jurkans and his wife Ilze at their lakeside house at Langstini.
                    Both are controversial, he for going too far to accommodate Russian interests in
                    Latvia and she for her part in a bizarre $400 million credit fiasco while at the
                    head of the Latvian Investment Bank. To her credit, she at least neutralized the
                    operation so the only cost to Latvia was embarrassment. Both are high-energy
                    people without, at the moment, sufficient scope for their ambitions.</p>
                <p>Monday, November 1</p>
                <p>The Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, came through Riga on a brief
                    overnight visit October 26-27. It was our highest-level visit since Vice
                    President Quayle was here last winter.</p>
                <p>Christopher, an introverted and indeed rather shy man, arrived in Riga at a time
                    when his media coverage had reached new lows. The day before his arrival, The
                    International Herald Tribune carried Congressman Frank X. McCloskey's call for
                    his resignation, significant since McCloskey is a Democrat and a Foreign Affairs
                    Committee member. The press has been full of scathing criticism of President
                    Clinton's foreign policy and Christopher's role in it, with the fiascos in
                    Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti drawing the most fire.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, it was a successful visit because it underlined high-level U.S.
                    support for the Baltic States, including the President's personal and continuing
                    engagement. The announcement of a further $160 million for officer housing to
                    support troop withdrawals from Latvia and Estonia made a positive
                    impression.</p>
                <p>The Secretary saw President Ulmanis, Prime Minister Birkavs and representatives
                    of the various Russian and Jewish communities; he met with all three Baltic
                    Foreign Ministers. Tuesday the 27th was his 68th birthday. Although the advance
                    team had strongly urged us to discourage all public festivities, I gave him a
                    small gift (a leather box with the Riga city seal) and got him to stop briefly
                    by the Embassy, where Elizabeth had lined all the staff up on the front steps as
                    we drove up.</p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>Russian troop withdrawals and Russian-Latvian relations were the chief issues;
                    the Skrunda early-warning radar got a lot of individual attention. The Secretary
                    denied any “deal” between us and Russia on Skrunda and said the issue was one to
                    be decided between Latvia and Russia — but he suggested a reasonable approach
                    might be an interim period allowing Russia to plug the hole in its early-warning
                    net that the loss of Skrunda would leave.</p>
                <p>Tuesday, November 2</p>
                <p>A quick trip to Tukums to see a gratis pollution-abatement project by Baltec.
                    President Ulmanis was also there. It's at a fuel storage site but the real
                    problem was caused by leakage from a fuel line carrying aviation fuel to the
                    nearby Soviet military airfield. As a result, the ground is absolutely saturated
                    with fuel. A test tube from a monitoring hole comes up with 80% fuel and just a
                    little water. Scary. It will take years to clean up the soil and
                    groundwater.</p>
                <p>Sunday, November 21</p>
                <p>Standing in the snow on the terrace of Riga Castle, we watch fireworks across the
                    Daugava celebrating the 75th anniversary of the declaration of Latvia's
                    independence. At the reception afterward, President Ulmanis offers Elizabeth the
                    first slice of Latvia's birthday cake.</p>
                <p>Monday, January 17, 1994</p>
                <p>I attend a meeting of Latvia's National Security Council chaired by President
                    Ulmanis. The ostensible purpose is for Charles Kupchan of the National Security
                    Council staff to brief on the Partnership for Peace, but I also use the occasion
                    to brief on last week's summit discussion of Baltic issues. Yeltsin agreed to
                    reduce the length of time Russia asks to stay on at Skrunda — to four years plus
                    18 months for dismantling — but he voiced the usual concerns about the treatment
                    of Russians in Latvia. The President said we would keep an eye on these,
                    primarily through the CSCE mission in Latvia, and react appropriately if any
                    violations are reported.</p>
                <p>Sunday, January 30</p>
                <p>My second exercise in transhumance. I am winging toward Washington, escorting all
                    eight political faction leaders from Latvia's Saeima plus Foreign Minister
                    Andrejevs and three of his aides to top-level meetings in Washington. The point
                    is to persuade not only the government but also the opposition that it is in
                    Latvia's interest to seize this opportunity to settle the troop withdrawal and
                    Skrunda squabble with Russia. The offer may not meet every standard of justice
                    and equity, but no better deal seems likely to present itself. The risk of
                    leaving the matter unresolved is high as Russia stumbles toward another
                    flirtation with easy answers, marked by nostalgia for the “near abroad.”</p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>Yesterday we overnighted in Frankfurt at the airport Sheraton, and I invited the
                    entire delegation to gather for a beer and a preview of the program. It turned
                    out to be one of the very few times all delegation leaders had assembled.
                    Perhaps I should continue this tradition of informal gatherings in Riga.</p>
                <p>Saturday, February 5</p>
                <p>JFK Airport. On the way back to Riga via New York and Copenhagen after a dazzling
                    program for the Latvian delegation in Washington. We saw everyone. There were
                    extended discussions with Secretary Christopher, Deputy Secretary-designate
                    Strobe Talbott, Deputy Secretary of Defense (and Secretary-designate) William
                    Perry and their immediate advisors, and a session lasting almost an hour and a
                    half in the White House Situation Room with Nick Burns of the NSC. After a
                    half-hour meeting with National Security Advisor Tony Lake in the West Wing's
                    Roosevelt Room, President Clinton and Vice President Gore both dropped in for a
                    few encouraging words and a photo. And, as they say, much, much more. A unique
                    program in my experience for any parliamentary delegation. A convincing
                    demonstration of the high interest in Latvia's problems at the top of the
                    American leadership.</p>
                <p>My impressions of the President? Clinton and Gore are both large men of the
                    college-fraternity type, with Clinton considerably the larger of the two.
                    Clinton's bulbous nose and the way he bulges out his suit give the effect of a
                    large inflated rubber doll. No doubt most famous people tend to strike us oddly
                    in some way in person because we have formed a strong but flawed conception of
                    them through their pictures, but I've seen my share of world leaders and with
                    Clinton the air of unreality was strong.</p>
                <p>Monday, February 21</p>
                <p>Jurmala. A long solitary walk, almost a mile, out onto the frozen Baltic. Beyond
                    the low jumble of ice dunes near the shore, the sea was frozen smooth, broken
                    only at wide intervals by re-frozen fissures that had the form of rivers. As I
                    walked, a layer of snow crystals crunched like cornflakes under my boots.</p>
                <p>Only a few people, including one ice fisherman, were out that far. I walked as
                    far out as I could go, up to a stretch of open water. There I had to stop,
                    although I could see more snow-covered ice beyond the dark water.</p>
                <p>Tuesday, April 12</p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>Paris. In Paris with E. since last Monday on a spring vacation, staying at a
                    small hotel called Le Jardin de Cluny, on the Left Bank near the intersection of
                    the Boulevards St. Jacques and St Germain. Lazy, lovely days just wandering
                    around the city, going to museums now and then but mostly just walking, looking,
                    drinking in this wonderful city. The weather is blustery, very dramatic on our
                    first two days, swinging from sunshine to blowing rain with only a few minutes
                    in between. It's exciting, energizing.</p>
                <p>Monday, July 18</p>
                <p>The fishing village of A, Moskenes Island, Norway. I'm sitting at the kitchen
                    table of a “sjohus” overlooking the tiny harbor of this little village, above
                    which tower the crags that make up most of the Lofoten Islands. Nico and I are
                    on a trip that began in Riga on July 10, took us by way of Tallinn and Helsinki
                    to Turku, then up the west coast of Finland above the Arctic Circle, briefly
                    through Sweden by way of Kiruna into Norway above Narvik, and then across by car
                    ferry from Skutvik to Svolvaer, from where we drove down to this lovely spot
                    near the end of Moskenes Island. Yesterday we hired a small boat with a four
                    horsepower engine to go, through rather choppy water as it turned out, to fish
                    near a small island offshore. Nico hooked one, but that was the extent of our
                    catch until later in the day, when I hooked a strange mutant-looking sea
                    creature from the balcony outside the sjohus kitchen.</p>
                <p>This trip is something of a reward to myself for a tremendously busy spring and
                    summer at the Embassy, including our first inspection and culminating in a visit
                    on July 6 by President Clinton. That visit was the first in history by a sitting
                    American president to a Baltic capital; Nixon's visit last year for all I know
                    was the first one by a former president.</p>
                <p>The public highlight of Clinton's visit was a speech at the Freedom Monument, a
                    punchy, supportive political act more than a policy statement. It seemed
                    consciously designed to forestall any possible comparisons to what Safire and
                    others have dubbed President Bush's ill-fated “Chicken Kiev” speech. Clinton
                    came out four-square for Baltic independence, albeit with a tactful reminder
                    that “freedom without tolerance is freedom unfulfilled,” an entirely acceptable
                    way to make a point that will ease the political sting for Moscow of the
                    speech's main thrust.</p>
                <p>By now it is almost 11 p.m. and Nico and I are on a car ferry passing Skrova
                    Island. Forced to abandon our plan to take the ferry from Moskenes to Bodo
                    because the ferry stopped loading two cars before ours, and yet another missed
                    ferry later, we are finally on our way from Svolvaer back to Skutvik, from where
                    we will push on for probably another three or four hours until we reach the
                    Saltstraumen, said to be one of the most powerful currents in the world. There
                    we will probably spend two days testing this “El Dorado for anglers,” as our
                    guidebook calls it.</p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>We wound up at the Lofotens largely at the urging of Norway's Ambassador to
                    Latvia, Torbjorn Aalbu, himself a native of Trondheim. I'm glad we took his
                    suggestion. The islands leave an indelible impression, towering out of the sea
                    collectively as a virtually unbroken craggy wall. When seen individually,
                    especially in misty weather when their peaks are shrouded in clouds, some of the
                    smaller ones look like the mushroom cloud of an exploding hydrogen bomb.</p>
                <p>One of the more unusual features of Clinton's visit was his reading to a
                    gathering of Embassy staff from all three Baltic capitals of a fragment from a
                    letter from George Kennan, a sort of bridge across several generations (Kennan
                    is 90) of U.S. diplomats in Riga. Kennan wrote the message in Norway, I believe
                    in Kristiansund. Kennan, whose wife is Norwegian, generally summers in Norway,
                    and is probably here now. I saw an advance copy of the text; I suppose I should
                    wait until the signed original arrives before replying.</p>
                <p>I must mention an unforgettable, jarring scene along the road as we were making
                    our way from A to Svolvaer. Three young boys, probably between seven and nine,
                    were gleefully jumping up and down on the roof of a white car which, its
                    windshield already crazed, seemed destined to become trash metal in short order.
                    It was stunning, even hilarious to see such young boys so zestfully engaging in
                    wanton vandalism so publicly in such an idyllic setting. But then I've had
                    doubts about the Swedish approach to childraising since our time in
                    Stockholm.</p>
                <p>Tuesday, July 26</p>
                <p>We are at Stryn, on the Innvikfjord in Norway, an arm of the Nordfjord, staying
                    in a private home with a superb view over the water. This privilege is costing
                    us 350 kroner per night. It is worth it. We tried hard to find a campsite last
                    night, but it seems that in this part of Norway every usable bit of horizontal
                    ground is already spoken for. We will spend another night here, in part because
                    I need to have the Volvo's brakes checked and this is about our last chance
                    before it forces us to postpone our Stockholm-Helsinki ferry trip.</p>
                <p>Our vacation so far has been colorful, to say the least. Our last campsite (we
                    acquired a tent about a week ago) was in a high valley off the Romsdalsfjord
                    near the town of Bostolen, by a wide, cold, quickly flowing stream — an almost
                    ideal site, except it happened also to be a favoured grazing place for a small
                    herd of cows. They paid us more than one unwanted visit, showing a sort of
                    placid, dull curiosity in our car and belongings and proving hard to move
                    on.</p>
                <p>We came to Stryn from Geiranger because it was said to be a good place for trout.
                    So far it has been a total failure in that respect. Luckily we have some fish to
                    our credit from earlier stops, including Saltstraumen, so the humiliation is not
                    too intense.</p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>Geiranger, by the way, of which I had romantic memories [from a solo visit ten
                    years earlier], was teeming with tourists and shrouded in a dull haze. Our visit
                    turned into a search of all the tourist kiosks for a shoulder bag of the type I
                    bought there ten years ago. But the bag is no longer offered, so we settled for
                    T-shirts and a nice lunch. In all, an extremely “tourist” experience.</p>
                <p>Sunday, July 31</p>
                <p>Aboard the M/S Tallink, entering Tallinn harbor. We boarded the Tallink this
                    morning in Helsinki, a few hours after crossing over from Stockholm on the far
                    more posh — and certainly, at 656 feet, far larger — M/S Silja Europa. The
                    Europa was awesome as an engineering tour de force, whisper quiet as it pushed
                    its enormous hull through the water. But inside, tourists kept things at the
                    level of money, beer, slot machines and commercial trivia. Unfortunately, a few
                    loud drunken Finns made their predictable appearance outside our cabin at around
                    one or two in the morning. Of course, in decibel terms our otherwise charming
                    room fronting on Strandvagen in Stockholm in the Diplomat Hotel the night before
                    had been louder, but street noise is far easier to ignore than raucous, drunken
                    shouting.</p>
                <p>On the Tallink the rough edges of the crew and the ship, although it has been
                    renovated somewhat, quickly reminded us that we were heading toward what so
                    recently was part of the Soviet Union. Certainly the fellow guiding cars onto
                    the ship tipped his origins when he asked if I could speak Russian (we had
                    failed to “register” before driving on, since there were no signs indicating
                    this was necessary). Most large vessels acquire some character over their years
                    at sea; the Tallink for the moment has no distinct personality. It inhabits that
                    uneasy post-communist transitional phase-space which its parent country, as well
                    as its two small Baltic neighbors, also now occupy.</p>
                <p>Friday, August 19</p>
                <p>Bonn. My room in the Hotel Maritim overlooks the Rhine. Tugs and ferries ply
                    busily up and down, back and forth. On the opposite bank just a short walk
                    downstream lies the American Embassy. You have to take a ferry to reach it; the
                    nearest bridge is several miles away.</p>
                <p>The U.S. Ambassadors to the Nordic countries and I have been summoned to Bonn by
                    Richard Holbrooke, Assistant Secretary-designate for European Affairs, whose
                    task is to inject new vitality into what almost everyone by now sees as a
                    flagging U.S. foreign policy. Bob Frasure, until July our ambassador in Tallinn,
                    is one of his new deputies. It should have been immediately clear to me that
                    Bob's new responsibilities include the Bosnian nightmare. His face and eyes have
                    the look of someone engaged in trench warfare — tired, depressed, even
                    frightened. Bob tells me I can't imagine what working in the Department is like
                    now. I assure him, in retrospect far too breezily, that I can.</p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>In the Embassy conference room, Dick floats with us his idea of creating a new
                    regional office dealing with just the Nordics and the Baltic States. His general
                    conception of how the Bureau will work is, to simplify, “the way it used to be”
                    — the regional bureau firmly in charge, issuing a steady stream of instructions
                    to embassies and shaping regional policy, with ambassadors taking the lead in
                    maintaining the health of the bilateral relationships on which these regional
                    policies depend.</p>
                <p>There is a dinner for us at Dick's residence, a splendid place overlooking the
                    Rhine that has housed American Ambassadors to Germany beginning with John
                    McCloy. The guests include the Nordic ambassadors to Germany, various German
                    specialists, and Latvian Ambassador Kesteris. Swedish Ambassador Orjan (and
                    Benedicte) Berner have recently come from Moscow. As I join them they are
                    speaking with Kati Marton, a slim woman of a certain unbuffed cerebral charm.
                    They are talking about Raoul Wallenberg; Kati says her publisher is about to
                    reissue her book on Wallenberg, written ten years ago, and she is working up a
                    new introduction. She of course is inclined to believe that Wallenberg lived
                    long after the Soviets say he died (in 1947); Berner does not.</p>
                <p>At the end of the evening Holbrooke asks the ambassadors to stay on for a wrap-up
                    talk. To my surprise, he seats Kati Marton next to him and takes her hand from
                    time to time as we talk about our business. Derek Shearer (Ambassador to Finland
                    whose sister Brooke is married to Strobe Talbott) informs me that (a) Kati and
                    Dick are an item; (b) she is still married to but separated from Peter Jennings,
                    to whom she refers as her “was-band.”</p>
                <p>Sunday, February 12, 1995</p>
                <p>Aboard a Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt to Riga. Coming back from Strasbourg,
                    where on Friday a ceremony marked Latvia's formal admission into the Council of
                    Europe. It has been a long time in coming, delayed mostly by the COE's doubts
                    over Latvia's hesitation about citizenship for Russians in Latvia, to call the
                    problem by its simplest name. But with a naturalization law now being
                    implemented and a law on aliens close to adoption, the moment was judged ripe.
                    Latvia is now the 34th member state, its flag flying proudly, thanks to the
                    alphabet, right in the middle.</p>
                <p>I decided at the last moment to witness this culmination of a process that began
                    while I was still Consul General in Strasbourg. Janis Jurkans, who made Latvia's
                    first, tentative contacts in Strasbourg, was there too, as was Georgs Andrejevs,
                    who resigned as Foreign Minister last year because of his collaboration,
                    marginal though it was, with the KGB. E. unfortunately at that very moment was
                    in Helsinki for extensive dental work, which she dreads.</p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>For me it was an intense three days of meetings with old friends and colleagues.
                    With Assembly President Martinez and Secretary General Tarschys I raised the
                    question of coming to terms with the past: does Russia have any responsibility
                    today for what happened in the Baltic States during the Soviet era? My
                    conviction is that there will be no stable relationship between Russia and
                    Latvia until Russia acknowledges that Latvia was annexed by force and assumes at
                    least a moral, if not necessarily legal, responsibility for the consequences.
                    Martinez, while interested, stressed the need to look forward, an emphasis with
                    which in general I agree. Both, though, seemed willing to consider whether the
                    “Baltic question” might be addressed in a COE-sponsored history project.</p>
                <p>On the lighter side, Jane Chandler arranged a dinner at Le Clou with Nico's
                    “foster parents” the Boulangers and with Dominique and Anne Foata. On Saturday I
                    persuaded Chris and Benedicta Kruger to go on an outing in the Vosges, where we
                    enjoyed an ample Alsacian meal in Obernai and then took an invigorating hike
                    along the Pagan Wall below the Mont St. Odile convent. Remarkably, at the
                    admission ceremony itself I found myself standing shoulder to shoulder with
                    Henrik Amneus, now Sweden's Ambassador to the COE.</p>
                <p>Monday, April 3</p>
                <p>London, The Churchill, Portman Square. Last Friday underwent surgery at the hands
                    of Mr. Geoffrey Glazer. Let's hope Mr. Glazer's work will last my lifetime.</p>
                <p>Not the reason E. and I would have chosen for coming to London but we're making
                    the most of it. Now into our second week, we've seen a sparkling, refreshingly
                    cerebral play, Tom Stoppard's “Arcadia” at the Theatre Royal, and a nicely
                    filmed “Dorothy Parker and the Vicious Circle.” We took the tube up to Highgate
                    and toured both cemeteries, passing by Marx and Spenser, then strolled lazily
                    across Hampstead Heath to Keats' house, rejoicing in the arrival of spring and
                    our escape to the principal wellspring of what used to be America's culture.</p>
                <p>Tuesday, April 4</p>
                <p>Blundered around the University of London, couldn't even find University College
                    without several tries, landmarks failing to jog my memory. How faint an imprint
                    my six months of study two decades ago have left. Finally managed to pay my
                    respects to the remains of Jeremy Bentham inside the college. More than a wax
                    figure but less than a mummy, the father of Utilitarianism by his own wish is on
                    display in a glass box. His true skeleton is the core of the likeness, clothed
                    in a black suit and crowned with his countenance. But a notice displayed
                    alongside is careful to point out that Mr. Bentham's head is not the real one,
                    only a wax replica, the true skull being secured in the university safe. One
                    senses a certain ennui with student pranks.</p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>Then to the British Museum for a peek at the domed Reading Room and a long gaze
                    on the Elgin Marbles.</p>
                <p>Thursday, April 6</p>
                <p>Yesterday, the worst headache in several decades, reminiscent of the agony after
                    my skull fracture during military training almost 30 years ago. Spent half the
                    day in bed; it began to abate around 2:30. Impossible to say what brought it on,
                    obviously not the half pint of stout I had the day before. No help from the
                    embassy doc. Only certain kinds of headaches, it seems, are considered a medical
                    issue. Mine seems to be, as we used to say in the Army, a personal problem.</p>
                <p>Drinks Wednesday evening in the Churchill bar, Clementine's, with Michael Shea,
                    not seen since Bucharest. After Bucharest Michael went on to become press
                    secretary to the Queen for some years, now has branched into all sorts of boards
                    and companies plus teaching but says he derives most income from his writing.
                    Two books about to come out, one with film rights already sold. Michael, in an
                    appealing way, clearly enjoys more money coming in than he needs. His wife Mona
                    had a hysterectomy a week ago, alarmingly is having fainting spells, so a group
                    get-together was not possible.</p>
                <p>An anecdote from Michael's Royal Years. With the Queen on a visit to the
                    surprisingly spartan Reagan ranch in the early 80's. Reagan is being prepped for
                    a speech to be given shortly. Bustling staffers hand him a text and apologize to
                    the President for giving him no opportunity to scan it in advance. “But don't
                    worry, sir, all the key parts are underlined!” The Queen remarks, “And I thought
                    I was the constitutional monarch!”</p>
                <p>Today a long museum walk, first to the Science Museum where I am captivated by a
                    silkily functioning Corliss steam engine designed to power 1700 looms. What
                    glorious creatures the Industrial Revolution spawned, if you like huge,
                    intricate, finely polished and delicately balanced rhythmically chuffing metal
                    behemoths.</p>
                <p>Sunday, April 9</p>
                <p>Reading the Sunday Times in Grosvenor Square. Sunny, cold. Behind and above me
                    the American Embassy's metal eagle spreads his 35-foot wings. The eagle is
                    looking sharply left and down toward a bronze Eisenhower, who directs his own
                    gaze toward his wartime military headquarters. In front of me and to the left
                    stands Franklin Delano Roosevelt, honored for bringing us into the war. Oblique
                    right is a memorial to the Eagle Squadron, American fliers who joined the war
                    effort early. Directly opposite lies the Italian Embassy, flanked by the
                    Canadian High Commission. A few dogwalkers. Some pigeons in the early stages of
                    the mating game. Steady traffic noise.</p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>Sunday, April 23</p>
                <p>Stockholm. A sunny spring morning in Skansen. Bliss. I enter at 9 o'clock, as
                    soon as the gates open, and for the first hour have the place pretty much to
                    myself. Small creatures are starting to stir: lambs, a cluster of energetic baby
                    wild boars, a small black foal. On the mare's back are four birds of an
                    unfamiliar type, busily collecting batches of the winter coat she is shedding to
                    use as nest material. She thinks it's just fine and contentedly lets them do
                    their work. I coax the foal over to the fence so I can rub his nose. Nearby a
                    perky litter of wild boars scamper around with their mother, digging in the
                    sandy soil for roots while their father lies near a sheltering pile of branches,
                    dead to the world.</p>
                <p>E. and I are in Stockholm for a regional conference of ambassadors: Nordic,
                    Baltic and, as a special treat, Tom Pickering from Moscow. It's Dick Holbrooke's
                    idea. He's also brought along Kati Marton (see above), who's done not only the
                    Wallenberg book but also another with a Swedish connection — A Death in
                    Jerusalem, the story of the assassination of Count Folke Bernadotte. Dick and
                    Kati's wedding is just a month or so away, we are told, and so indeed it would
                    appear even to an uninformed observer.</p>
                <p>We're staying in the Hasselbacken Hotel, next to Skansen and almost within
                    eyeshot of our former home at Djurgardsslatten 104, that dear creaky old house
                    where Cecilia Hagen and her children still live, as E. found by paying a visit
                    this morning.</p>
                <p>The ambassadors' conference left something of a bad taste. For one thing, after
                    exhorting us to “stop whinging” about budget cuts, later in the session
                    Holbrooke did an about-face and apologized to us for having to ask us to carry
                    out such a misguided policy — one with which, he said, he profoundly
                    disagrees.</p>
                <p>Toward the end, during the session with Tom Pickering, I made the point that the
                    President's decision to commemorate May 9 in Moscow leaves him vulnerable
                    politically. It represents his participation in the celebration of a Russian
                    military victory — the defeat of Hitler by Stalin — on the heels of Russian
                    military atrocities against civilians, including of course Russian civilians, in
                    Chechnya. Moreover, it comes at a time when the Russians seem to be jerking us
                    around, refusing to reverse their decision to provide nuclear technology to Iran
                    and becoming increasingly unhelpful vis-a-vis the Serbs in former Yugoslavia.
                    (We had just been humiliated that very day when the Serbs refused to permit our
                    new ambassador to Bosnia as well as special representative Bob Frasure to get
                    from the airport into Sarajevo. After spending a night in sleeping bags, they
                    finally flew back out again leaving what is left of our policy, in Holbrooke's
                    own words, in tatters.)</p>

                <p>Pickering said it would be just veterans parading in Moscow. Bill Miller,
                    ambassador to Ukraine, maintained that after all the May 9 celebrations are
                    about the victory over fascism. I said it might be possible to maintain that if
                    the President were commemorating the event in Paris or London. In Moscow, it
                    means commemorating Stalin's victory over Hitler, the enslavement of Eastern
                    Europe, the annexation of the Baltic States, and the beginning of the Cold War.
                    And that meant we must make sure in statements before and during the event what
                    we were celebrating and what not. Not the most important element, but useful, I
                    said, would be a statement, perhaps before Moscow, mentioning the special fate
                    of the Baltic States. And more in this vein.</p>
                <p>Pam Pearson, a political officer who had been one of the early TDY'ers in Riga,
                    came up afterward and congratulated me for the “courage” of my statement. As for
                    most of my colleagues, I think they viewed it as something akin to farting at
                    the dinner table, to put it in language Lyndon Johnson would approve. Holbrooke
                    ended that discussion with the assertion that “Neither Yeltsin nor Clinton can
                    afford for the summit not to be a success, so it will be a success!”</p>

                <p>Nico, back in France after a spring trip to Florence (ah!), sounds fine. His
                    college choices are excellent. No rejections. He's been accepted by Princeton,
                    Chicago, Georgetown and the University of Virginia; Harvard and Columbia have
                    him on their waiting list. He decides to send an acceptance letter to Princeton
                    but wants to see if he can get accepted by Harvard and Columbia too, leaving
                    until later the decision whether actually to go to one of them rather than
                    Princeton.</p>
                <p>Wednesday, April 26</p>
                <p>Riga. Juris Vitins, a relative on my father's side, died while we were in
                    Stockholm. E. and I take Margita along to his funeral.</p>
                <p>We arrive at the small chapel near the entrance to the Forest Park cemetery and
                    place our flowers on the stepped ledges of the stand on which lies the open
                    coffin. Juris is pale, waxy; he has gone. It occurs to me that I would not want
                    to be laid out in an open coffin after my death.</p>
                <p>At noon six of Juris' brothers-in-arms form up alongside the coffin. We wait. An
                    electric organ plays. In a few minutes a corpulent middle-aged man wearing brown
                    shoes, baggy pants and a nondescript black raincoat comes from behind a screen
                    and steps to the foot of the coffin. It is not clear whether he is a minister;
                    he seems more an underpaid caretaker from an earlier age, one at home in the
                    works of Tolstoy or Dickens. But from his mouth come sonorous, moving words
                    summing up Juris' life, his struggle on behalf of his country, and the love his
                    family and friends feel for him.</p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>We follow the coffin to the burial plot. It is lowered, unsealed, into the grave.
                    Juris' wife Anna, his daughter Dzintra, her husband, E. and I and a few others
                    toss handfuls of yellow sand onto the coffin. Four gravediggers then ply their
                    shovels swiftly and skillfully, filling the hole in minutes, then forming a
                    coffin-shaped mound of sand above the grave with expert slices and pats of their
                    shovel blades. The job done, one of them prints a cross onto the sand coffin
                    with two sure pushes of his shovel's handle. They stand back respectfully. The
                    minister/caretaker speaks again. We cover the grave with flowers.</p>
                <p>Juris was 63. His final years were painful and only his tremendous will kept him
                    going. The autopsy showed all his organs had deteriorated, a process no doubt
                    traceable to ten years in Siberian exile, some to the heavy drinking that he
                    conquered. I miss him.</p>
                <p>Thursday, April 27</p>
                <p>Around 4:30 in the afternoon I notice unusual activity in front of the Embassy.
                    Looking out my office window, I see a man on his back beside the flagpole, his
                    white face staring up at the flag and, now, at me. An ambulance stands by the
                    curb and several people are standing near it, talking. Soon the ambulance drives
                    off, leaving the man still lying beneath the flag. It seems he has been
                    pronounced dead and is now in someone else's jurisdiction. He lies there for
                    another 45 minutes, now covered with a black cloth, while three government
                    agencies prepare the documentation needed to admit him to a morgue. Finally he
                    is taken away.</p>
                <p>Friday, April 28</p>
                <p>There is a debate in the press about new nominations for the Order of the Three
                    Stars, Latvia's highest award. Some 57 persons are reported to be on the latest
                    list. This seems a lot. Is Latvia is trying to make up for the 50 years during
                    which the Order was suppressed? In part, no doubt it is.</p>
                <p>Most controversial are the nominations of former Latvian Prime Minister Ivars
                    Godmanis and French President Mitterrand for the highest degree of the Order. I
                    find the choice of Mitterrand particularly unsuitable given the humiliation —
                    unnecessary, in my opinion — that he inflicted on the Baltic States at the Paris
                    CSCE summit. This was in the winter of 1990-91. After long negotiations, a
                    formula had been meticulously worked out for including the foreign ministers of
                    the not-yet-independent Baltic States in the proceedings. Yet when Gorbachev
                    looked out over the hall and saw the Baltic ministers, a whispered ultimatum to
                    Mitterrand sufficed to impel the French host to order them ejected from the
                    hall. A day of shame for the CSCE and one which Mitterrand did not, in my
                    opinion, redeem by any subsequent support for Baltic independence. French
                    engagement here in any case has seemed rather cool except in certain
                    security-related activities. No doubt the French consider the Balts too
                    irredeemably prone to German influence to invest much energy here.</p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>Mitterrand's managing to be the first Western head of state to visit Riga was
                    surely not enough to erase his disgraceful performance at the CSCE summit.
                    During that visit, I now recall, he said something fairly snide to me at the
                    crowded reception in the hastily spiffed-up French Embassy. I remember rising to
                    the occasion with a tart riposte. E. confirms I was pleased with my comeback at
                    the time, but I can't remember now what Mitterrand or I said. This must be the
                    opposite of l'esprit de l'escalier. I doubt we can hope to find an account of
                    this moment in Mitterrand's memoirs.</p>
                <p>Saturday, April 29</p>
                <p>There is more to the Three-Star scandal than controversy about the nominations of
                    Mitterrand and Godmanis. Again card files left behind by the KGB take their
                    toll. The enormously engaging Professor Janis Stradins is the latest victim. His
                    letter to President Ulmanis, resigning from the Three Star selection committee
                    and declining his own nomination for an award, appears in today's Diena.
                    Stradins' story is much like Andrejevs'; as a scientist, he was required to
                    report on the scientific aspects of his foreign travel, but he claims he never
                    reported on his colleagues, or knowingly to the KGB, for that matter. But
                    Stradins felt he had to withdraw because his name appears in the card files the
                    KGB left behind.</p>
                <p>These KGB records are a poison pill that Latvian society has yet to neutralize.
                    KGB veterans must be smiling grimly at how their work continues to torment
                    Latvia. President Ulmanis yesterday, in a meeting with parliamentary leaders,
                    said something has to be done about the KGB records soon but he specified only
                    what should not be done: destruction of the files, which would leave unanswered
                    questions, or sealing them, which could always be undone. Ulmanis called for
                    resolution of the issue by the Saeima, but that fledgling institution has not
                    proved up to the task till now.</p>
                <p>Thursday, May 4</p>
                <p>The spectacular demolition, synchronized to New Age music, of the unfinished
                    Skrunda large phased-array radar was the most visible U.S. intervention in
                    Latvia since President Clinton's visit to Riga last July. The 19-story “Skrunda
                    monster,” as most Latvians call it, collapsed in a huge heap under its
                    tile-encrusted slanting receiver wall, sending a thick brown cloud of dust
                    drifting slowly toward the apartments housing Russians who continue to work at
                    the Skrunda Hen House radar. It symbolizes the end — or must we continue to say,
                    the beginning of the end? — of the era of Soviet occupation.</p>
                <p>Moscow is annoyed. There was last-minute pressure, mostly through the media, to
                    delay the irreversible moment. Afterwards, the deputy speaker of the Duma sent
                    President Ulmanis a telegram calling the demolition “an act of state stupidity.”
                    Kozyrev strikes a manful note, pointing out that after all the building belongs
                    to Latvia.</p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>Saturday, May 6</p>
                <p>A walk along the beach at Jurmala. Gray weather. Fine sand. A malodorous brown
                    muck lines the water's edge as far as the eye can see.</p>
                <p>I drive for no particular reason once again to the tiny coastal town of Engure. I
                    love its little church though I have never set foot inside. And there's
                    something romantic and melancholy about its well-tended cemetery by the sea. Two
                    small girls, unaccompanied, come with little bunches of flowers and place them
                    on a fresh grave.</p>
                <p>Monday, May 8</p>
                <p>The Latvian leadership and diplomatic corps dash back and forth across Riga in
                    Keystone Cops motorcades as we commemorate VE Day. Not an unambiguous event
                    here, certainly not a liberation. That must be part of the reason why we went
                    rocketing back and forth. First, with President Ulmanis and Prime Minister
                    Gailis in the lead, we stand for an hour in a cold drizzle at the Brethren
                    Cemetery. As acting dean, I lay flowers on behalf of the diplomatic corps. Then
                    an unscheduled dash to the Jewish cemetery, probably because two nights ago an
                    explosion went off at the Riga synagogue, causing damage but not casualties.
                    Then to the German and finally the Russian/Soviet cemeteries, all at top speed.
                    At the Russian cemetery, a motley group formed up, then gave forth beautiful
                    music to accompany the short service. A cheap-looking fake-bronze relief of a
                    young Soviet soldier flourishing the inevitable hammer-and-sickle banner jarred
                    with the mood of reconciliation.</p>
                <p>Meantime the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of victory are reaching epochal
                    levels in London. After two days of fun in sunny Hyde Park, the climax is a huge
                    public gathering in front of Buckingham Palace to mirror what happened exactly
                    half a century earlier. The emotion of victory remembered reportedly stimulated
                    a kiss from Prince Charles to Princess Diana's cheek, the first in many a moon
                    to which we have witnesses. In Paris, the celebrations have a two-fold meaning
                    for French conservatives, who have just seen Jacques Chirac finally win the
                    French presidency. The United States, unfortunately, is represented at the
                    European festivals by Vice President Gore, not the President. Clinton has been
                    persuaded to focus on the May 9 observance in Moscow. A pity. Worse, a
                    mistake.</p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>Fascism and anti-semitism as issues have lurched sickeningly to the fore in
                    Latvia, with a helping hand from Big Brother to complement all-too-human local
                    proclivities. Before the synagogue bombing, there was a flap over publication of
                    10,000 Latvian-language copies of Mein Kampf. More unpleasant was the
                    “revelation” by a former KGB-nik in Moscow that President Ulmanis' father had
                    collaborated with the Nazi special services. Not an accident; it coincided with
                    the President's travel to Paris and London for VE commemorations. This rising
                    nastiness is all too reminiscent of the old Soviet propaganda line that the
                    Balts were just nasty little antisemites, civilized only by the firm Soviet hand
                    that brought them into Moscow's fold. Looks like the start of a mud fight;
                    they're always hard to win.</p>
                <p>Wednesday, May 10</p>
                <p>Yesterday I watched part of the Moscow celebrations on TV. Clinton attended the
                    parade of veterans, reportedly including veterans of Chechnya, in Red Square but
                    not the military parade at Poklonnaya Gora. He did, however, arrive there in
                    time to help dedicate a huge, ugly, tasteless and expensive new war monument,
                    one that according to Vlad Posner had already been a gleam in more than one
                    apparatchik's eye in the Brezhnev era. I heard part of General Grachev's
                    climactic speech, the part where he said Russia's defeat of Germany saved world
                    civilization and Russia therefore needs a strong military force.</p>
                <p>In Riga, around noon, the sound of a large but distant explosion shook my office
                    window. A similar noise buffeted the bedroom windows that evening. Today we read
                    it was probably Mitterrand's Concorde, going to and from Moscow.</p>
                <p>Today the Clinton-Yeltsin bilaterals took place in Moscow, with meager results.
                    At the joint press conference Yeltsin said there was no Russian military action
                    in Chechnya now, just Interior Ministry forces confiscating illegal arms from
                    bandits. Clinton did not contradict him to his face — one could argue, I
                    suppose, there was no need, since it's patently untrue. The President does issue
                    an unambiguous call for an end to the Chechen tragedy in his speech at Moscow
                    State University.</p>
                <p>One conclusion: whatever this is, it is not a “Summit.”</p>
                <p>Saturday, May 13</p>
                <p>In the morning I jog down to the old Legation, first taking a loop around the
                    waterside restaurant in Kronvalda Park. Renovation work on the restaurant, it
                    seems, is not only incomplete but terminated. Must have been a bankruptcy.</p>
                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>Grey skies, an intermittent light drizzle. Few people out. Exceptions are the
                    very old and the very young, who have their different reasons for shrugging off
                    the weather. Also to be seen are the inevitable young men carrying briefcases or
                    bags. During my visit to Riga in the Soviet era, some of those were focused on
                    me, and they were carrying the tools of the KGB trade.</p>
                <p>The topic calls up a memory of my visits to Riga during the Soviet period and my
                    first visit to Leningrad, when I shamelessly tried to shake my “tail” in the
                    subway. These days it's harder to tell what they're up to.</p>
                <p>Pondering this point, I round a corner near the Swedish Gate and almost run into
                    a young man with a bag. He passes to my right. I stand watching him. Half a
                    block away, he stops and turns. We look at each other. He turns and walks off,
                    as do I.</p>
                <p>Tuesday, May 16</p>
                <p>A visit to a trial in Riga District Court. It lies behind the central train
                    station. We're back in the seventeenth century, with a heavy Soviet overlay.</p>
                <p>The case, chosen at random, concerns the theft, almost two years ago, of about 5
                    tons of manure fertilizer. Value: 5 lats ($10 at today's rate). In fact, the
                    manure was returned the next day but the case plodded inexorably on through the
                    legal system nevertheless. The defendant is a slim, likeable Ukrainian driver,
                    Vladimir Monoilenko. He understands a good deal of Latvian but prefers to speak
                    Russian. The court provides an interpreter, a Russian sex bomb (thinks she is)
                    in a black miniskirt. Monoilenko declines a lawyer, mumbling about lawyer's fees
                    compared to the value of the manure, which he admits having taken.</p>
                <p>Asked why he didn't respond to earlier summons to appear that the court began to
                    issue this January, Monoilenko's basic argument is that he couldn't believe this
                    case was going to trial. I find this plausible.</p>
                <p>There is a good deal of Soviet-style fussing around. The judge, who is flanked by
                    two lay assessors, clearly refined her technique during the Soviet period.
                    Finally the prosecutor, an appealing dark-haired young Latvian woman who seems
                    to have been hit hard in the right temple, asks for a six-month suspended
                    sentence with one year's probation. The judges retire to ponder the case. We
                    depart.</p>

                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>The Latvian Government has the misfortune of facing simultaneously a budget
                    crisis and a banking crisis. I meet separately with Latvian Bank President
                    Einars Repse and Finance Minister Andris Piebalgs. To both I quote the old
                    Chinese proverb, “Every crisis is an opportunity.” (I first heard this in
                    Vietnam, where it did not, apparently, apply.) What I mean is that Bank
                    Baltija's vulnerability offers a chance to clean up banking practices as well as
                    cleaning out some undesirable characters.</p>
                <p>The banking crisis centers on Bank Baltija's liquidity problem triggered by the
                    maturing of time deposits on which BB promised 90% interest. Most suspect there
                    is more to it than that, and estimates of the shortfall run as high as $57
                    million. This is beyond the government's ability to cover, but neither can the
                    government leave BB's 500,000 depositors entirely to their fate; elections are
                    only four months off. I urge Repse to focus on protecting small depositors and
                    to seize the opportunity to force BB to clean up its act and its management. I
                    point out that BB's top dog, Aleksander Lavent, can't get a U.S. visa because of
                    his past criminal record. Repse, showing signs of stress, says he is in effect
                    compelled to enlist cooperation from Lavent and the bank. On the budget side, a
                    dearth of revenues combined with difficulty in selling Treasury bills force the
                    government to resort to commercial loans at punishing rates to meet basic
                    obligations. That situation cannot go on, and drastic cuts are to be announced
                    tomorrow.</p>
                <p>Thursday, May 25</p>
                <p>Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma was in Riga on Tuesday and Wednesday. As acting
                    dean of the diplomatic corps I greeted him at the airport on arrival and
                    departure and attended the state dinner in Riga Castle. A taciturn technocrat,
                    Kuchma strikes me as a positive figure, oriented toward reforms and good ties
                    with the West.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, Latvia's banking crisis has steadily grown in size. Bank
                    Baltija's financial operations have been suspended while work toward a takeover
                    agreement goes on. Finance Minister Piebalgs announced his resignation last
                    week; today he was replaced by one of his deputies, Indra Samite, a young
                    Latvian-American educated at Drexel. Repse is under some threat as well but will
                    likely survive; his deputy, Ilmars Rimsevics, may not, as the hunt for
                    scapegoats intensifies. I tell Gailis, Birkavs and other members of the
                    leadership to focus the search for culprits on Bank Baltija, particularly
                    Lavent, not the central bank or the government.</p>
                <p>Sunday, May 28</p>
                <p>With E. to the Press Ball last night. Our third — or am I losing count?
                    Definitely low-budget compared to last year's extravaganza; few frills or
                    flourishes, perhaps because of the Bank Baltija bust. Yet it was refreshing,
                    too, to see fewer of the ostentatious nouveau riche, more normal young people
                    having a good time.</p>
                <pb facs="0173" n="Page0173"/>
                <p>Left early; we're both pretty run down after a long stretch with virtually no
                    free evenings. Friday night was one of the more pleasant ones, a jazz evening
                    with the Egils Straume trio at the British Embassy, continuing a tradition that
                    E. and I started in our residence two summers ago. The bass player, Ivars
                    Galenieks, is wonderful, a brooding musician from Dostoyevsky with a bald
                    forehead, long straggly hair hanging down in back, and the strong dangerous
                    hands of a crazed peasant.</p>
                <p>Even Saturday was a busy day for me, with a visit to the Latvia's Way
                    pre-election party conference, a talk with a visiting Congressional staffer
                    (Anne Smith, who works for Jesse Helms), and an afternoon garden party at Karine
                    Petersone and Raimonds Auskaps's half-house in Meza Parks to bid farewell to the
                    Lassillas.</p>
                <p>In the meantime in former Yugoslavia, Bosnian Serbs, provoked by UN-ordered
                    airstrikes, have taken almost 200 members of the UN peacekeeping force
                    hostage.</p>
                <p>Monday, May 29</p>
                <p>Memorial Day, so the Embassy is closed. In the afternoon E., my mother and I
                    drive down to a horticultural research station near Dobele.</p>
                <p>We take the Embassy car rather than the offered bus and are the first to arrive.
                    The view greets us of a large field recently cleared, with huge piles of brush
                    still heaped up on it. On an adjacent plot of land is an unimposing stand of
                    head-high lilac which we are invited to admire. We have plenty of time to do so.
                    The bus bearing the other guests arrives an hour late; it seems they were
                    waiting, in vain, for Sirka Lassilla, wife of the Finnish Ambassador. The lilac
                    varieties bear names like “Girl of Dobele” and “Love of Life.” One of them is
                    named after Imants Ziedonis, a gesture that I believe indirectly gave rise to
                    this event.</p>
                <p>After the others join us and we have heard the Lilac Lecture, we trudge over to
                    another field for a reading by Imants Ziedonis, not one of his best, and a
                    harpsichord (actually, virginal) concert by Aina Kalnciema. The quality of the
                    music is excellent, but there is a practical problem: clouds of mosquitoes. We
                    have come prepared, and I apply repellent to Aina as well. But there is hardly
                    enough for all, and many suffer acutely through the concert.</p>
                <p>Saturday, June 3</p>
                <p>First to the annual handicrafts fair at the Ethnographic Museum, which is getting
                    better and better. I stand for half an hour near the stage, which is ingeniously
                    shaded by a silk parachute suspended from the trees, where Latvian boys and
                    girls assemble to perform folk dances. Quick changes of costume, much running
                    about, herding by the parents and older girls, crises, some tears. The boys more
                    mischievous, all lovable.</p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>It suddenly reminds me of being backstage at the Kennedy Center in Washington
                    when the Kirov Ballet was peforming, perhaps in 1987. What an athletic event
                    dancing, especially ballet, is! It took me aback to see how stringily muscular
                    the lead female dancers were up close. The vigorous massaging their handlers
                    gave their thighs and calves between numbers was just like the rubbing, oiling
                    and pummeling boxers get from their trainers between rounds.</p>
                <p>In the afternoon we drive down to Ojars Felbergs' annual spring art festival at
                    Firkspedvale, near Sabile. It's a crumbling German estate in a delicious hilly
                    locale, the Abava Valley. Felbergs has had the imagination to transform it into
                    a setting for art even while most of it is still in a state of dramatic ruin.
                    There are sculptures in the wrecked buildings, and stone and wooden structures
                    throughout the woods and fields. Today even the horses and cows, tastefully
                    distributed in the fragrant, flowering pastures, are pendants on the necklace of
                    Art.</p>
                <p>Sunday, June 4</p>
                <p>In the morning with my mother and Margita to the Raina Cemetery to place flowers
                    at my grandparents' grave. Then to the much fresher grave of Juris Vitins,
                    nearby.</p>
                <p>Saturday, June 10</p>
                <p>Up until now the bank crisis has if anything only grown in scope, with the
                    shortfall creeping toward 200 million lats ($400 million). Uldis Klauss, the
                    Latvian-American named to take over Bank Baltija, finds fresh horrors each time
                    he digs deeper into the books. It's a classic Ponzi scheme, he says, which
                    perhaps came to an unexpectedly rapid end because a small and impoverished
                    country like Latvia can't provide enough gullible victims. Nevertheless last
                    week the government team gave bank strongman Lavent another two weeks to come up
                    with cash to salvage the operation. Not entirely clear why Lavent asked for the
                    delay, nor why he got it. Most likely, he's using the time to spin the web more
                    tightly, hide assets more deeply, or destroy the evidence of malfeasance.</p>
                <p>But the cavalry is coming, the IMF rep told me yesterday. A Bank of London expert
                    with experience in global-scale bank fraud is writing up a set of
                    recommendations, and a team will be assembled. Yesterday I told Foreign Minister
                    Birkavs the bank scandal alone is not a problem for Latvia; everyone expected a
                    bank collapse. What could really hurt Latvia is a failure to act decisively to
                    remedy it or to permit criminals to remain in banking here.</p>
                <p>Tuesday, June 20</p>
                <p>The tempo of [diplomatic] arrivals and departures quickens. We near the end of a
                    round of farewell events for the Lassillas. E. and I are having to make up lists
                    of guests for our own round of farewell dinners, beginning with one on July 3
                    hosted by [Israeli Ambassador] Tova Herzl.</p>
                <pb facs="0175" n="Page0175"/>
                <p>No relief yet on the banking crisis, with the government still dodging a
                    decision. When I saw Einars Repse at the Queen's Birthday reception, he seemed
                    quite haggard, whether from fatigue or fear I couldn't be sure. To my chagrin,
                    all the Western banking specialists — the senior IMF, EBRD and World Bank reps —
                    have just left for vacation, as though the crisis were over.</p>
                <p>Thursday, June 22</p>
                <p>Walt Slocombe, an old acquaintance from Princeton who is now Under Secretary for
                    Policy at the Defense Department, was in Riga for a two-day visit, coinciding
                    with that of the frigate USS Taylor. The official program ended at about 5 pm,
                    and Nico and I joined Walt on a bike trip across the Daugava and back.</p>
                <p>Friday, June 23</p>
                <p>We didn't join the Diplomatic Corps for the annual midsummer expedition, instead
                    drove to Ungurmuiza near Cesis/Sigulda — where we wound up with a busload of
                    German tourists, a group active in the Lutheran Church. But a pleasant evening
                    nevertheless, and a nice drive back to the Embassy around midnight, still
                    light.</p>
                <p>Tuesday, July 4</p>
                <p>Sunday we had our now-traditional Independence Day outdoor cookout, about 600
                    people and hamburgers, hot dogs, Tex-Mex, apple pie, salads, beer, soft drinks,
                    and two bands, the Riga Wind Orchestra and a small jazz group, both of them
                    excellent. Splendid weather, cool and sunny just as during the President's
                    visit. My diplomatic colleagues are baffled and envious; they wonder how I do
                    it. I use my short speech, in Latvian and English, to say goodbye, and E. makes
                    some moving remarks, much appreciated.</p>
                <p>Yesterday was the first of our formal farewell dinners, this one hosted by Tova
                    Herzl with guests including Foreign Minister Valdis Birkavs, Professor Janis
                    Stradins, Diena editor in chief Sarmite Elerte, Atis Lejins, and some others.
                    Nico was there too, mature and good-looking in tie and blazer.</p>
                <p>Today we all feel as though run over by a truck, not from the dinner but from the
                    general stress of preparing to depart. It's the most difficult time, with most
                    of the sorting and arranging still ahead of us. Well, I didn't make any progress
                    on it today, instead taking a long and rather aimless drive with Nico northwest
                    along the Baltic coast beyond Engure, then over to Talsi and back to Riga. Most
                    of the way back we drive through a light rain.</p>
                <p>Friday, July 7</p>
                <pb facs="0176" n="Page0176"/>
                <p>My farewell call on President Ulmanis, fittingly, is in his new office in Riga
                    Castle. Much of the old building is still awaiting a facelift, but the
                    President's office and the approaches to it have been attractively redone. At
                    the President's request, E. accompanies me. During the meeting, she urges him to
                    remain optimistic, look to the future, and put his hope in Latvia's
                    children.</p>
                <p>Wednesday, July 12</p>
                <p>With packing now going full blast, I hold my last large staff meeting, then
                    attend a G-24 meeting focused on legal education. Also there is Soros Fund
                    president Aryeh Neier, who indicates he is inclined to support Sweden's lead in
                    establishing a law program in conjunction with the Stockholm School of Economics
                    in Riga.</p>
                <p>As I walk back to the Embassy and approach the Freedom Monument, an old lady
                    springs up from a bench, thanks me for what I have done for Latvia during the
                    past four years, and gives me a kiss. A nice ending: it was another old lady on
                    the same bench who muttered “traitor!” as I walked by not so many months
                    ago.</p>
                <p>Friday, July 14</p>
                <p>At 8:15 a.m. E., Nico and I, accompanied by the Chief of Protocol and a small
                    delegation from the Embassy, leave for the airport. We receive flowers before
                    boarding the Baltic International flight, a Tupolev 134, for Frankfurt, where we
                    change to Delta Airlines for Washington. So ends one story.</p>
