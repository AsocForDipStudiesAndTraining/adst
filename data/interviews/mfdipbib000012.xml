                <p>Interviewed by: Jack O'Brien </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: January 5, 1990</p>

                <p>Experience Prior to Federal Government Employment</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Burnett, I noted before you got into government, you had a
                        long and interesting career which, in some respects, prepared you for the
                        government. I wonder if you could give us a summary of your career before
                        the government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Sure, I'll be glad to. I came out of the University of Rochester, New
                    York, in 1940, with a B.A. degree in economics and not much idea of what I
                    wanted to do. I got a job with the Vick Chemical Company in one of the pioneer
                    management training programs. I was on the road selling. Their idea of training
                    was to get you out selling Vicks to drugstores and general stores, mostly in the
                    South. It only took about six months for me to decide definitively and
                    permanently that the world of business was not for me.</p>
                <p>By the end of the following year, I had managed to get back to my home area and
                    was appointed press secretary to Governor Harold Stassen of Minnesota. This was
                    a long time before he became a quadrennial joke. It was a very interesting go
                    for a couple of years.</p>
                <p>In 1944, I finally achieved what was really, I guess, my latent ambition for a
                    long time, and became a reporter on the Minneapolis papers, the Cowles empire.
                    After a year or so of general reporting, I found myself right back in politics
                    as a political writer. In 1947, I went overseas as a foreign correspondent,
                    writing principally for the Minneapolis papers, but gradually picking up ABC
                    Radio—this was pre-television, of course—and Look magazine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were based where?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: I was based in Stockholm during these five years, but traveled very
                    steadily through the whole Scandinavian area, including Finland. Of course,
                    these were fascinating times after the war. One of the most interesting stories
                    was the way that Finland escaped coming fully under the domination of the
                    Soviets and managed to survive very largely as an independent nation.</p>
                <p>1951: Entrance Into U.S. Government Information Work - The Marshall Plan</p>
                <p>Then in 1952, the head of the Marshall Plan organization in Germany persuaded me
                    to come down and put in a little public service, which I thought would be a year
                    or two before I went back to my real love of news work. I became press officer
                    for the Marshall Plan organization, which was then a very large information
                    operation. In fact, the information budget for Germany, West Germany alone, the
                    year I came there was $65 million, almost as big as the total Agency's budget a
                    couple of years later.</p>
                <p>1954: Brought Into USIA in Washington</p>
                <p>This was exciting. 1953 was the year of the first anti-communist riots in Berlin.
                    I was in Berlin doing a good deal of information work on that at the time. But
                    in late 1953, as we know, USIA was created, and early in '54, Ted Streibert and
                    Abbott Washburn brought me back to handle domestic press relations for USIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let us identify those two men, please.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Ted Streibert was the Director of the Agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the first one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: The first one, appointed by Eisenhower. He was a veteran radio
                    executive. Abbott Washburn was out of Minneapolis. He had been an Eisenhower
                    supporter in the campaign, and he got the deputy position. I had known Abbott a
                    little bit back in Minnesota when he had worked for General Mills</p>
                <p>In any event, this was a fascinating year. We were still in the so-called
                    [Joseph] McCarthy era, and I had the pleasure of tangling, at least
                    tangentially, with Joe a couple of times, whom I had known, by the way, and
                    covered a little bit when he first ran for the Senate of Wisconsin in 1946.</p>
                <p>Deputy Director USIA Press and Publication Service</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>In any event, then a very interesting job came along. The Press and Publication
                    Service was being run by a chap named Lee Briggs, a veteran, and a successful
                    one, of many years in New York advertising agencies, a wonderful, creative guy,
                    marvelous idea man, superb gentleman, but no executive. He chose me as deputy,
                    and I found myself pretty well running the place.</p>
                <p>There was one thing that happened that is very � propos at the moment with the
                    so-called communist empire crumbling in Europe. During World War II, we had an
                    exchange of magazines with the Soviet Union. In the year 1955, Eisenhower had
                    come up with his famous Open Skies proposal, the idea of mutual observation of
                    our military establishments by satellite photos. This was a main subject on the
                    agenda at a summit meeting with Khrushchev, I think in Geneva, at the end of
                    1955.</p>
                <p>Trials and Ultimate Success Birth of Post-War Magazine “Amerika”</p>
                <p>Included on the agenda was a proposal to have now a peacetime exchange of
                    magazines, as we did during World War II, and when the conference was over,
                    absolutely nothing had been agreed on. Then to our tremendous surprise a couple
                    of months later, the Soviets came through and said, “Well, we'll do the
                    magazines.” It would have been January or February of 1956 when we were faced
                    with producing a new version of “Amerika.”</p>
                <p>In any event, I was doing the testifying for the Press Service before the
                    notorious John J. Rooney, the scourge of the foreign affairs establishment and
                    the administration, as head of the Appropriations Subcommittee in the House. I
                    told him, when he raised the question that the magazine had come up too late to
                    be included in the budget, but that we would reprogram and get it going. Ted
                    Streibert had called me in just a couple of days earlier and told me that the
                    monkey was on my back, and not only was it on my back, but that we had to move
                    fast. He and others apparently had the idea that the Soviets may have been
                    preparing for this quietly and were all ready to dump their first issue on us at
                    the moment the papers were signed, and we would look silly if we couldn't get a
                    magazine going in short order.</p>
                <p>In any event, Rooney also asked about the cost of it, and based on the World War
                    II experience, I was stupid enough—or Ted was, or both of us—to say, “Well,
                    based on what we did before, it looks like it will be pretty much of a wash.
                    We'll get enough income to cover it.”</p>
                <p>Anyway, everything worked well. I decided to print in Berlin. The cost was only
                    about 40% of what it would be in the United States, and also to do the
                    translating over there. I sent my chief of operations, whose name, of course, I
                    can't remember, over to take care of the Berlin end of it.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>The Washington end, we drew on our own resources. Herb McGushin, who had been
                    Chief of the News Division, got the job as editor and chief honcho, and there
                    were other talents available in house, in terms of the magazines that we had
                    already been putting out in many languages for many parts of the world. We
                    worked awfully hard, and we were very, very fortunate that everything went well.
                    We had our first 50,000 copies, which was the agreed number, in Moscow, in the
                    embassy, ready for distribution by July 4.</p>
                <p>But then some other things didn't go so well. In any event, the Soviets weren't
                    ready, and by the time we started actually putting out the magazines on both
                    sides, it was probably September or October, we had three issues in the bank by
                    that time and a very nice little backlog.Meanwhile, it was drawing some public
                    attention, and the printers unions and printers trades in New York had come down
                    and made a d�marche, saying, “This should be an American product. We shouldn't
                    be printing something for the Soviet Union in a foreign country. We're just
                    going to insist that this has to be brought back and printed in the United
                    States.”</p>
                <p>Then the negotiations with the Soviets were terribly tough. Earlier, we had
                    gotten a 90% return of the retail price and, of course, the magazine sold out
                    every month. The magazine would not have been financed by the taxpayers in this
                    case. But the Soviets found, in dealing with U.S. distributors, that they
                    couldn't get any kind of a break like that, and they would be lucky to net 50%
                    of the retail price in the United States. Furthermore, their magazine couldn't
                    be sold at a high price in the United States; it had to be competitive with
                    other magazines that carry advertising and so on.</p>
                <p>Also, the State Department imposed their wishes about the magazine. We had wanted
                    to go with something a little more newsy, a little more informative, a little
                    less glossy than the World War II product, which had been kind of a Life
                    magazine style, using a lot of color, big, glossy paper and so on. They said,
                    “Look, if we go in with anything less impressive than before, they'll think
                    we're poor, and we've got to maintain the same kind of quality and
                    standard.”</p>
                <p>So we brought the printing back to the U.S., we put out that kind of magazine,
                    and we argued with the Soviets about distribution. All they were willing to give
                    us was exactly the same percentage of return that they were getting on their
                    magazine. Then on top of that, their magazine wasn't selling very well. Soviet
                    Life didn't really compete very well with Life magazine and Good Housekeeping
                    and Holiday and all the other magazines available on the newsstands. So that
                    also affected the income.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>I had the pleasure, if you call it that, of doing the negotiating on this with
                    the editor of Soviet Life, who was based at the Soviet Embassy here in
                    Washington. It was really very funny, because we kept trying to bring the
                    pressure on to have them sell more magazines, but always the number of returns
                    that we got as unsold was exact, exactly the same figure as the number of unsold
                    copies they had for that particular month. Our magazines were used, of course.
                    They were delivered back to the embassy and they were used as handouts there, or
                    they were distributed with exhibits when we were able to stage exhibits in the
                    Soviet Union and so on, and, of course, tremendously popular individual pages
                    from the magazine sold on the Black Market at very substantial prices in the
                    Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>However, every time I had a long conversation with my Soviet counterpart and
                    explained how this was a free society and you had to make the best deal you
                    could, and the government couldn't distribute the magazines for them, it wasn't
                    our fault if they weren't getting as good distribution as they wanted. That was
                    their problem. The last line was always the same. I can quote it today. After
                    saying, “Well, I understand everything you've told me and I realize our systems
                    are different,” and so on and so on, my Soviet counterpart would conclude, “but
                    it comes down to one thing. I sell magazines. You sell magazines.” That was the
                    bottom line. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>Eventually, they did better, and I think maybe even the CIA at one point went in
                    and started buying up a few copies of their magazine in order to increase the
                    sales so that more of ours would get out in the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>But I had the problem of going back up to face John Rooney on the financing of
                    the magazine. It was now in the budget for over half a million dollars. Sure
                    enough, about the first question I got asked was, “Well, last year you were up
                    here and told us this magazine wasn't going to cost anything. Now here you are
                    asking for half a million dollars. What's the story?” Well, happily, in the dry
                    runs, you know, when we faced Rooney, we tried to figure out what questions
                    would be asked and to develop the best possible answers. I had been sweating
                    this one for months. I knew it was going to be mean and I didn't want to be
                    kicked around by him. He could ask that same question in many ways and fill a
                    lot of pages of the record with how spendthrift we were and so on.</p>
                <p>But Bill Hutchinson, who was then the newsroom chief, came up with the key. We
                    were sitting around the table in my office, playing the question-and-answer game
                    four days before the hearing, and all of a sudden, Bill asked, in his rather sly
                    way, “Well, this is being printed by union labor. Has it got a union bug on it
                    anywhere?” So I thought for a minute or so and I said, “Yeah. Rooney's district
                    is full of printing companies, isn't it, and unions?” So I immediately dictated
                    a telegram to the Soviet Union, to our embassy in Moscow.</p>
                <p>When Rooney asked the question, I said, “Well, yes, there's been a change in the
                    financing, but I think it can be explained.”</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>He said, “I'd like to have you make a try.”</p>
                <p>So I said, “(A) We had to make a more expensive product than we planned. (B) We
                    couldn't get the kind of distribution proceeds that we thought we'd get from the
                    Soviet Union. And (C), most important, this ought to be a totally American
                    product printed by American union printers and printing trades. So we moved it
                    back. Right now we're exploring with our embassy in Moscow about including the
                    union label on it, saying that this magazine is printed in the United States by
                    free American unionized labor, locals number so and so and so and so.” And there
                    weren't any more questions. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good story.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: So the magazine turned out to be very successful. We were lucky in
                    having good talent, won lots of prizes, and eventually the distribution tended
                    to get improved. As we look at what's happening now, a lot of people are
                    wondering whether our efforts over the years, that is to say, USIA, specifically
                    in terms of getting information to people by various means, including this
                    magazine, may have played a part in what has eventually evolved there. In any
                    event, we know that we were on the side of the angels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After your assignment with IPS, which lasted until 1957,
                        your next assignment was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>1957: Assignment as PAO and Counselor of Embassy in Tehran</p>
                <p>ANDERSON: The next assignment was Iran. The fact was that I considered my stay in
                    Washington temporary. I had gone overseas because I wanted to see the world, I
                    wanted to work overseas, and I saw people constantly rotating. From time to
                    time, personnel or an area director had approached me for an overseas job, but
                    when Hunt Damon came along and, in effect, offered me Iran, that really—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's identify him.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: Hunt was Assistant Director for the Near East Area at that time. That
                    one really excited me. The offer coincided with a trip I had to make to Manila,
                    where the Press Service ran a printing plant, and to Beirut, where we ran
                    another one, which was part of my operation involving several hundred people.
                    The trip gave me a chance to stop in Tehran and have a little look at it. I had
                    never been in that part of the world before, and once I had spent a couple of
                    days there and gotten a feel for what was going on, I decided I really wanted
                    it. My wife, who was a veteran of the Swedish Foreign Service, that's how I had
                    met her originally, was all for it. We had two very young sons, but they were
                    old enough to move anywhere, and we decided to go and were very excited about
                    it.</p>
                <p>In view of what has subsequently happened, I have often thought of a conversation
                    I had with a counselor of the Iranian Embassy before I went to Iran. I had
                    arranged to meet him to pick up some background and so on, and one of the things
                    he did was trace Iran's history of relations with various other major countries.
                    As I recall, he started with Russia and the problems with Russia, and how Iran
                    now had no time for the Soviet Union, and then how they had had a love affair
                    with France, and how that had gone sour. Then the Germans rose to be friend
                    number one in the 1930s, as I recall, followed by the British, who put the young
                    Shah back on the throne early in the 1940s, and how that had gone wrong. But he
                    said, “We don't have any reason to hate the United States yet.” Well, a few
                    years later, they found some reasons, apparently.</p>
                <p>In any event, Iran was fascinating at the time. We did have very close relations
                    with the Shah. Even I, with the rank of counselor, dealt directly with the prime
                    minister, the foreign minister, the minister of court. We were personal friends.
                    They were in and out of our house from time to time, and one really felt close
                    to the people you were working with.</p>
                <p>It was a challenging time, both in terms of living conditions and so on, but I
                    thought a very rewarding one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our major activities at that time? We had a
                        Fulbright program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: We had a Fulbright program. In fact, I think we started the Fulbright
                    program there. Martin Ackerman, another colleague, was my cultural affairs
                    officer. I really got involved with students there, because I thought it was the
                    upcoming generation that was going to be the important one, and if I
                    accomplished anything major, I think it was actually being able to penetrate
                    into the University of Tehran and establish a full-time Student Center, which
                    drew very well. Obviously no results of it are visible today, but we made the
                    effort. We also had an extremely thriving Iran-America Center, and I was able to
                    raise the money and break the ground for a beautiful independent building,
                    which, of course, went with everything else when we got thrown out of there.</p>
                <p>Anderson Selected for National War College 1957, But Postponed it Until 1960</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>But as I say, a very rewarding time, so much so that in 1959, I was offered an
                    appointment to the War College and I asked to postpone it for a year, and they
                    said, “You can't do that. You've got to take it or turn it down and then take
                    your chances in the next year's competition.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, I think two years is too little for what we've got invested in me
                    here, and I'm going to take another year.” But happily, a year later the
                    appointment to the War College came through again and I came back to the States
                    in the late spring of 1960 to spend a year at Fort McNair.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That brings us up to your assignment after the War
                        College. Will you proceed with that, Burnett?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Fine. One of the many, many people who came through Iran—I'd like to
                    digress here and talk about a presidential visit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>During Which Time Received President Eisenhower Visit And a Short Visit by Ed
                    Murrow</p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Because it may also be � propos and I feel kind of strongly about it.
                    Eisenhower made a tour. I think it was in December of 1959, going to several
                    Near East points and, I think, a couple of European stops. Anyway, he had half a
                    day in Iran. We had to prepare to receive him. The advance party at that time
                    consisted of Jim Hagerty and a communications expert. They came in, spent some
                    time with us. We laid out the details, figured out the parade routes and so
                    on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's identify Hagerty for the newer generation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Jim Hagerty was Eisenhower's press secretary, a great and well-known
                    veteran of years of writing for the New York Times. That was the advance party.
                    The communications guy arranged to increase temporarily the number of lines of
                    communication with the world. I think at that time the total was one full-time
                    telephone line and one teletype circuit out of Tehran. That was our electronic
                    link to the world. [Laughter]</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>That visit went flawlessly in every respect, and I like to think back how it was
                    handled then with a couple of people coming out from the White House, and the
                    embassy doing the job it's supposed to, as compared with the imperial advance
                    team and the pre-advance team. Now a pre-advance team goes out from the White
                    House and makes sure everything is ready for the advance team when it comes in,
                    and these are full-time positions. I shudder to think of that layer upon layer
                    of stuff there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any observations on the caliber of our local
                        employees, either there or in other posts where you've been?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: I think we've been very lucky in the caliber of employees we've been
                    able to get everywhere. I've always had many very good ones, a few real duds.
                    You sometimes get a kind of distortion. In Iran, for example, they sometimes
                    referred to the American Embassy as the Armenian Embassy because we had such a
                    high proportion of Armenians on the local staff. But I had absolutely marvelous
                    support, people who were working for minimal salaries, but who were maybe
                    carrying doctoral degrees or had the qualifications that would have made them
                    top-level executives in any Foreign Service anywhere in the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you suppose that any of them were abused or suffered
                        later when the Iran Government took over our embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: I have no news of that. I would like to know. There are many people
                    whom I remember fondly. I do know that some of them got out. One is, or was
                    until recently, employed by the State Department here, an extremely talented
                    man, a responsible and civilized person. The Iranians, it seemed to me, produced
                    some of the best and most civilized people I've ever dealt with, as well as this
                    incredibly frightening fanatic wing that eventually seized power.</p>
                <p>Murrow's Visit Probably Led (1961) to Anderson's Assignment To Special
                    Inter-Agency Group Study on Counterinsurgency</p>
                <p>Anyway, we did get Eisenhower in and out, and then got me back into the War
                    College. Another visitor was Ed Murrow. That was his sabbatical year, but as
                    always, he was working. He came in for a couple of weeks and did a major feature
                    on Iran. We spent a lot of time together. That may have been—probably
                    was—instrumental in my next assignment, because when Murrow became head of the
                    Agency in the early part of 1961, he not only eventually found me sort of hiding
                    out down there in the obscurity of the War College, but pulled me out of there
                    before the year was finished, to pick up on a special inter-agency study. We did
                    a thing on what was called limited warfare in remote areas. The study was done
                    by a large inter-agency team, and was one of the foundations for the creation of
                    President Kennedy's special group for counterinsurgency. Bobby Kennedy chaired
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>So then began the fascinating years of work, first with Ed Murrow as Director of
                    USIA, then with Carl Rowan, and then with Leonard Marks, a succession of three
                    very different and three very remarkable people.</p>
                <p>And to Associate Deputy Director, USIA, for Policy &amp; Plans</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your positions during those years were what, Burnett?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: The first position was created for me. It was called Associate Deputy
                    Director of the Agency for Policy and Plans, and it was essentially as deputy to
                    the Deputy Director for Policy and Plans. The hierarchy, as most people would
                    remember, was Murrow as Director, Don Wilson, who had come out of Time Life, as
                    Deputy Director, and Tom Sorensen, who had been a career officer but was moved
                    up by Murrow to the number-three job in the Agency, and mine was generally
                    regarded as the number-four job. It was, I think, a very happy working
                    arrangement. Of course, Murrow was an inspiration to most of the people,
                    including me, who worked for him any length of time.</p>
                <p>The Cuban Missile Crisis - 1962, And —</p>
                <p>They were heady times. One of the most unusual things that happened had to do
                    with the Cuban crisis of 1962. I was originally chosen—well, let's back up a
                    little bit. Murrow was out. He was having one of his bouts with pneumonia or
                    pulmonary disease of some kind. So Don Wilson was Acting Director. There was the
                    ExCom, as it was called, the executive committee in the White House, that ran
                    the operation with President Kennedy, and then there was a working group under
                    that. Walt Rostow chaired the working group under Mac [McGeorge] Bundy of the
                    National Security Council and ExCom. I was put on the working group as the USIA
                    guy.</p>
                <p>The thing began early in the week, as I recall, and I was meeting every day in
                    these inter-agency sessions. We were looking at all the various options and
                    doing whatever we could to prepare our principals for the next meetings that
                    they were going into as the crisis unfolded.</p>
                <p>Temporary Assignment to VOA to Coordinate All Output Regarding the Crisis</p>
                <p>Then on Sunday morning, I came in as usual. We were working full Saturdays and
                    Sundays, of course. I was called down to Don Wilson's office. Don said, “I've
                    got a new assignment for you. I want you to go down to the Voice of America now
                    and stay there until further notice.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, okay. What are my instructions?”</p>
                <p>He said, “You're personally responsible for every word said on the air.”</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>And I said, “Well, you know, you've got a director down there named Henry Loomis,
                    who I think thinks that's his job.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Henry's been informed. We've explained to him that this is such a
                    fast-moving situation that it doesn't reflect any lack of confidence in him or
                    any desire to supplant him, but because we are moving so fast, we've got to have
                    somebody from here who is clued in, whom I can call from the White House the
                    moment an ExCom meeting is organized.”</p>
                <p>Well, I was just saying this was the Cuban crisis, and I was being sent by Don
                    Wilson, Acting Director of USIA and member of ExCom, to go down and take over
                    the Voice of America.</p>
                <p>Henry Loomis and I had been friends and had worked together successfully in the
                    hierarchy from the time he had been special assistant to Ted Streibert in the
                    1950s. I had, and still have, the very highest regard for him. It was a little
                    embarrassing to come down a few minutes later and walk into his office and have
                    him stand and say, “Well, here's the desk,” and start reaching for his hat.</p>
                <p>I stopped him and said, “Henry, I want you to know that I have absolutely no
                    intent to supplant you here. I'm concerned about only one thing, and that is the
                    immediate output of the Voice. The only way I can handle that is to get right
                    down into the mouth. I'm going to sit at the slot in the newsroom and do
                    everything right from there, because that's where the control point is. I don't
                    want your desk, I don't want your secretaries or anything. I don't need any
                    logistical support. I hope that we can take this in an impersonal fashion. I
                    didn't ask for the job, and I don't want you to feel that I have any desire to
                    infringe or supplant or whatever.”</p>
                <p>Well, Henry was contemplating resigning, he told me. I took it as a measure of
                    his perspective and judgment that he simply didn't do so in a huff, but thought
                    about it and, in fact, discussed it with me. I told him I thought it would be a
                    great mistake for him to resign, that he had made a real contribution as head of
                    the Voice, both temporary and long range, and had more to do, and that I
                    wouldn't be in his hair. Eventually he did think better of it and did not
                    resign.</p>
                <p>We had good luck at the Voice. A terrible thing to get hold of all the output,
                    because it was going out in 36 languages, 38, whatever the case was, in addition
                    to the recurring English newscasts. There were all kinds of little subsidiary
                    operations, little feature programs, little interview programs, and so on. To
                    gain absolute authority over everything that was being written for broadcast
                    took some doing. As it turned out, the national radios of the Soviet Union and
                    the U.S. eventually were used as a direct means of communication between
                    Khrushchev and Kennedy, and indeed, it was those exchanges in the open that
                    eventually led to the settlement of the crisis.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>I'd like to emphasize this because of my regard for Henry Loomis and the fact
                    that we did not only stay friends, but, indeed, when he became head of Public
                    Broadcasting, he called me up and asked me if I'd be interested in taking a job
                    as his deputy. It's a very, very happy memory of what could have been a very
                    awkward business. So we got through that one. Something similar happened a few
                    years later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get to that, how much longer did that assignment
                        continue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: I can't remember. I think it went for about three weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, is that all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes. It was just until the crisis was solved and a few days following,
                    and then we were able to turn it back to the normal machinery.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened then? Wilson called you and said, “Your
                        detail is over”?A</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NDERSON: I don't even remember. I probably went uptown one day when things were
                    quiet, and said, “Well, look. They don't need me down there any longer. I'd like
                    to go back to my desk,” and Wilson said, “Okay.” There had never been any formal
                    appointment or anything like that. It was just a purely ad hoc arrangement to
                    get a specific job done, and we did it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever have the impression that Wilson had been
                        ordered by the White House to put such a person as you in that slot?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: I did have the impression that it was not an independent decision. The
                    whole relationship—I might talk about this for a moment—between the management
                    of the Agency and its radio arm has been a problem for years. The Voice preceded
                    USIA. For a while it was physically located in New York and, therefore, not
                    subject to the immediate kind of hands-on control that you have when you're
                    located in the same town or the same building. Frictions over the years between
                    the desire of the head of USIA to maintain and carry out his responsibilities in
                    connection with the Voice and the feeling on the part of many people at the
                    Voice that they should be independent, just like any private broadcasting
                    outfit, was a source of all kinds of problems all the time. The argument was
                    never really over policy, although that was the word that was used. The argument
                    was over who was going to run the Voice.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Burnett, I cannot refuse a footnote. I was one of Henry
                        Loomis' deputies before the period you cite. But I'm the one who wrote the
                        charter, what is now known today as the charter of the Voice of America. I
                        wrote it. That took me deeply into the subject you just touched on. The
                        instructions that I was given at that time are on the record. Henry has a
                        copy, as does Cliff Groce, who is writing a history of VOA. I couldn't
                        resist that footnote.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Let us say that you then returned uptown, as the phrase was in those days. The
                    assignment uptown was what?</p>
                <p>Return to Regular Policy/Plans Assignment. Preparation of Weekly Report From
                    Murrow to White House</p>
                <p>ANDERSON: It was what it was before, as Associate Deputy Director for Policy and
                    Plans. One of the most delightful aspects of it, even though it was hard work,
                    was doing drafting for Ed Murrow. Ed Murrow rendered a weekly report to
                    President Kennedy, about which he was very, very meticulous, and which I had to
                    draft each week. That, of course, gave me overview of everything that was going
                    on in many areas, and a lot of special assignments. Very often I would go in and
                    spend a full day on the telephone, calling around the world to get immediate
                    reactions from a number of key posts for a special report. Kennedy was very
                    interested in public opinion surveys as they affected our foreign affairs, and
                    we did a lot in that field. I did a lot of writing for Ed, and I also
                    occasionally was called on to draft speeches. Kennedy was not happy with much of
                    what he was getting from the State Department in terms of speeches and so on,
                    and so he would ask Ed, and Ed would ask Don, and Don would ask Tom, and Tom
                    would ask me, and I wound up—well, I can claim that I'm the only person living
                    or dead who ever wrote speeches for Harold Stassen and John F. Kennedy.
                    [Laughter] There is no such other animal.</p>
                <p>So it was a great mix of things that affected everything right across the board
                    for the whole Agency, from budget administration, to personnel, to crisis, to
                    routine operations, to the application of policy lines, to the output of all the
                    media. We had Stevens running the Motion Picture Branch, a very creative
                    guy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: George Stevens.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes, George Stevens. Not very patient with the bureaucracy, and yet he
                    did some great work. We had some real disagreements. In retrospect, I think
                    probably he was right more often than I was. He did a lot to bring new life and
                    greater professionalism into that motion picture operation.</p>
                <p>1964: Deputy Director USIA: Policy and Plans</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>So there were interesting people, fascinating times. I was getting ready, in
                    fact, to call it quits and get back overseas, where I thought I belonged, when
                    Murrow's untimely death changed everything. Carl Rowan came in as Director and
                    appointed me to the job of Deputy Director for Policy and Plans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that essentially a continuation of what you had been
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes, it was essentially the same structure. We just sort of picked up
                    and kept going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then he was succeeded by Leonard Marks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that true there, also, that you were doing the same
                        work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Exactly. Exactly. It really didn't change. Some of the details would
                    change with a change in directors. For example, I did some speech writing for
                    Carl, but Leonard very rarely ever spoke from formal speeches, and very often
                    didn't really need notes or summaries of what he did, whereas Carl did do quite
                    a bit of public speaking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any comment, Burnett, on either of these men or anything
                        else before we proceed to your next assignment? One question comes up,
                        obviously, which is relations with the State Department during that period.
                        Did it change any?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: It changed pretty much with every incumbent, but a fairly good routine
                    had been established. We had the so-called fast policy operation with a member
                    of my staff over in all the daily meetings that prepared the State Department
                    spokesman. Then he came back for a meeting and passed it on to the policy people
                    and the operators in the various media. That part of it became pretty well
                    routine.</p>
                <p>I did have other responsibilities of various kinds that were interesting. I was
                    made liaison with the CIA for information operations, which, in essence,
                    required me to meet with them once a week on terms which would not in any way
                    involve us in their operations, but to make sure that in things they were doing,
                    we were not working at cross purposes, their people telling one thing and our
                    people telling something else, as has happened historically.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>I was also liaison with the Pentagon for purposes of their information outlets
                    overseas, such as the armed forces broadcasting network and certain other things
                    that they did in public affairs. Again, perhaps more to make sure that we
                    weren't working at cross purposes than to impose any policy line or anything
                    like that.</p>
                <p>The main thing in all of this, as I saw it, and I repeated it constantly, was
                    accuracy. Particularly in a large bureaucracy, the danger of things getting
                    distorted or wrong when they're passed from one to the other, from one layer to
                    another, is very great. I used to tell people at the Voice—I don't know if you
                    ever heard this echo back to you—when we would get into these disputes, I would
                    say, “Look, if you would allow me to impose my standards of accuracy on your
                    operation, I would abolish the policy mechanism. What we're talking about is
                    getting the information and getting it right. What policy comes down to is
                    accuracy. To the extent that you're reflecting a government or being interpreted
                    as reflecting our government, you've got to be right. You can't be wrong. If we
                    can get the appropriate level of accuracy, we wouldn't need policy.” So that was
                    my approach, maximum level of accuracy in all these areas where I was
                    functioning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were leading up to the point where you were in the
                        mood to go overseas again, which would have been about 1967.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>1967: Public Affairs Officer - Spain Problems as Transition from Franco Era
                    Approached</p>
                <p>ANDERSON: 1967. I had been designated for Argentina, but a health problem delayed
                    it. Instead, I was lucky enough to go off to Spain at an absolutely fascinating
                    time in the history of that noble peninsula. The situation there was that Franco
                    was more or less on his last legs. He was still nominally in charge, but the
                    very tight dictatorship was crumbling a little bit at the edges, and the
                    so-called opposition was being able to articulate itself more and more.</p>
                <p>My principal contact was Fraga Iribarne, Minister for Information. We met early
                    in the game and had a very frank talk when I first called on him, and I remember
                    saying, among other things, “I plan to operate here in normal fashion. I hope to
                    be in touch, as we are everywhere, with all segments of your society. If there
                    are people who for some reason you don't want me to be in touch with, it seems
                    to me you've got two choices.” This was the time when there were student riots
                    and so on and evidences of unrest of all kinds. “You can either take the person
                    out of circulation yourself or you can declare me persona non grata.”</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>I was very eager to work with these emerging parties, because obviously the clock
                    was running, and the end of the Franco regime was inevitable. The old theory,
                    you know, you've got to stay in with the outs or some day you're going to be out
                    with the ins. They were bright people who were, in effect, preparing themselves
                    and in various ways organizing and publishing some fairly incendiary stuff
                    against the day that there would be a change. In fact, I designated one member
                    of my staff, in effect, as the principal liaison with these emerging groups,
                    particularly the young people. This was being watched, and I thought it might
                    lead to some trouble at some point, and it did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any specific restrictions placed upon our
                        activities at that time?ANDERSON: Nothing specific. Nothing specific. We
                        presumably would use good judgment, but we did meet with people who were
                        known as oppositionists. What eventually happened was that sometime during
                        1968, late 1968 or early 1969, there was a crackdown and several people were
                        picked up and put in essentially domestic exile, house arrest, if you will,
                        or something bordering on it, in towns outside of Madrid, including a couple
                        of good friends of mine.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Then I got word that my staffer, who was operative in this area, was going to be
                    declared persona non grata. I was not able to establish that with certainty, but
                    what I did was I called up Fraga and said that there was this rumor floating
                    around, and I hoped it wasn't true, but if it were true, and if they did declare
                    him persona non grata, I would leave before he did and I would have a press
                    conference if I could before departure or immediately after arriving in the next
                    capital, explaining why I left. So that persona non grata business never
                    happened, as far as I know.</p>
                <p>I was fascinated by Spain and delighted by the way that the transition could be
                    made peacefully, the Spaniards apparently finding their way into the latter part
                    of the 20th century and into an integrated Europe without bloodshed or civil
                    war. Civil war was the thing to be feared. If the military had been unwilling to
                    accept a transition to a more representative society, it could have been a very
                    bloody thing. Happily, that didn't happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were there two years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your next assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>1969: Transfer to Paris as Director, USIS France</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: Next assignment was what might be called a troubleshooting job. I had
                    gotten something of a reputation as a troubleshooter. In any event, Sarge
                    Shriver wanted me in Paris, and I wasn't ready to leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sargent Shriver, we should note, was the American
                        ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: He was the American ambassador. I managed to stave it off for a while
                    because I wanted to continue working in Spain. I had been sent there for a
                    five-year tour, and was finding it enjoyable and fascinating and rewarding. I'd
                    gotten the language under good enough control so I could go out and lecture
                    without having to read a speech and so on, and do the various things in the
                    language of the country.</p>
                <p>But Sarge, when he was reappointed by President Nixon for an additional year or
                    more in Paris, then got insistent. Of course, Paris had its attractiveness,
                    shall we say. In any event, I had no choice but to move on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain, Burnett, how you happened to know

                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: When I was working for Murrow principally, but also later under Rowan
                    and Marks, I did an awful lot of inter-agency work, I was the number-two man on
                    a couple of special groups. I was representative of the Agency on Bobby
                    Kennedy's committee to work on young people. He had gotten that bug when he was
                    on a foreign tour and had been, in effect, assaulted by a mob of youngsters in
                    some Far Eastern country, and decided we should be doing more with young people.
                    I sat on that group. I backed up Murrow and/or Wilson in the special group CI,
                    special group for counterinsurgency, and several other inter-agency things,
                    where occasionally Shriver was also involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Shriver at that time was Director of the Peace Corps.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: He was Director of the Peace Corps. Also, I had had to see him
                    occasionally about things that we wanted to do vis � vis the Peace Corps in
                    terms of publishing something or whatever, which he generally fought against,
                    because he didn't want us—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this deserves development briefly, at least. He
                        was trying to preserve the purity of the Peace Corps, is that correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: Absolutely. It was an operation of good will and assistance, and he
                    didn't want it in any way to be tainted by association not only with USIA or the
                    CIA, but even trying to keep it removed from the embassies in the country where
                    it was operative. I think the policy was sound, and I think the policy has
                    succeeded.</p>
                <p>But in any event, he did insist then that I come to Paris, and I acquiesced and
                    made the move in the summer of 1969, succeeding Lee Brady, who was an old and
                    accomplished French hand. Shriver was fun to work with, very vigorous. I don't
                    think this was generally understood. He was, in his way, flamboyant. He was
                    creative. I used to say, when I had to deal with him, I said, “When you're
                    talking to Sarge, don't ever give him an idea or a proposition until you're
                    solid with it and satisfied with it, because if you suggest something exciting,
                    he'll be halfway across the Pl�ce de la Concorde with it before you finish the
                    sentence.” A great guy to work with. In that regard, you had to know how to work
                    with him.</p>
                <p>One thing he said—and curiously enough, he meant it—was, “You know, I am an idea
                    man and I generate a lot of ideas, and I like to think that at least some are
                    good.” But he said, “That may be only two in a hundred. You guys have got to
                    tell me the ones that aren't any damn good so that we won't be doing a lot of
                    crazy things.” And I had occasion from time to time—it was really great—to go
                    over and see him or call him up about something, some piece of paper he had sent
                    over which said, “Let's do this,” or, “Let's do that,” or sent some guy to see
                    me who had some brilliant idea, and I'd have to go in and tell him, “Sarge, a
                    lousy goddamn idea.”</p>
                <p>And he'd say, “Then we won't do it, will we?”</p>
                <p>I'd say, “No.”</p>
                <p>He'd say, “That's what you're here for.” So he did, in fact, really mean
                    that.</p>
                <p>He had a conception of the position that I thought was absolutely sound.
                    [Charles] De Gaulle, you know, was president, and we were suffering so-called
                    anti-Americanism to a considerable degree. There was an awful lot of terribly
                    critical and inaccurate stuff on the TV that nobody had been able to do anything
                    about and so on and so on. But he knew and understood that there is a basic—what
                    should I say?—friendship or pro-American disposition at heart in the population
                    as a whole. He was out to carry the message to De Gaulle through the people, and
                    I think he did it very successfully. Indeed, by the time I came along, after I
                    got into it, we were able to make some real strides with the TV of France, and
                    gradually changed that terribly critical and distorted orientation, which is
                    another long story that I won't try to go into here.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>But I considered him an extremely effective ambassador and I became very fond of
                    both him and Eunice. Beneath all the glitter and the play for the public and so
                    on, warm, decent, generous, concerned human beings, both of them. I think when
                    Sarge, from his pinnacle of power and prominence talks about the people who are
                    less fortunate, he's not kidding. He really means it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had a total of eight years in France?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes. I thought I'd just go up there and last as long as Shriver, then
                    move on. I never prepared to work in France. Spain was my first romance
                    language. I had German and the Scandinavian tongues, and thought I was more or
                    less naturally cut out for work in that area. But fortunately, I had the wit to
                    settle right in and learn French, because then along came the famous Dick
                    Watson, the younger scion of the IBM hierarchy, and his mottled career, but he
                    wanted me to stay on. Then came Jack Irwin, his brother-in-law, who was as much
                    of a gentleman as his predecessor was not, just a wonderful human being. Then
                    Ken Rush, who had been Deputy Secretary of Defense, got the nod. We regretted
                    that, because Jack had been, we thought, a marvelous, marvelous ambassador, but
                    Ken turned out to be a very solid, very able representative, as well. He left in
                    1977 after the election, and shortly after that, I was assigned over to London
                    for my last tour with the Agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those were what years in London?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>1967: Transfer to London as Head of USIS U.K.</p>
                <p>ANDERSON: 1967 to 1969. I came in with Kingman Brewster and then left when the
                    60-year-retirement rule was briefly in effect, just at the time of my 60th
                    birthday. If my birthday had been five months earlier or two months later, I
                    wouldn't have been caught by it. But as it turned out, it was a good thing. It
                    was time for me to move on, and I was glad to do so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were pleased to round out your career in London,
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Oh, yes, indeed. Those were interesting years. London, of course, is an
                    extraordinarily civilized place still, on certainly any comparative basis with
                    other large urban concentrations. I had a lot of fun there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any regrets, reviewing your career? Would you have made
                        different moves if you had had the opportunity?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: That's a hard question to answer because it's not the sort of thing I
                    think about. Generally, I think I have been so fortunate with the things that
                    have come along at the right time, the right people, the right exposure, that
                    I've never had much occasion to really examine any alternative options, so to
                    speak. The headhunters used to come around once in a while and dangle money in
                    front of me, but nobody ever offered me enough to make me think it would be
                    worth it to give up the world in which I lived, which was foreign affairs and
                    with the element of a certain amount of writing and creativity involved.</p>
                <p>Post-Retirement Activities</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know that you are a very active retiree. Would you like
                        to say what you're doing now and whether any of what you're doing now
                        relates in any way to your government career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Everything relates to a government career when you get down to it,
                    because you're always dealing with people in one context or another. I'm back to
                    what was my original love, and that is writing and editing almost full time. I
                    have developed a specialty in the field of numismatics, coin and currency
                    collecting, and I run a little news bureau here in Washington, doing work mostly
                    in that field for a major publisher with several periodicals.</p>
                <p>I also do a little editing and writing. I've written the fourth and fifth
                    editions of the National Geographics book on the Supreme Court. Actually, it's
                    the Supreme Court Historical Society's book, Equal Justice Under Law: The
                    Supreme Court in American Life, which is produced by the Geographic. That's the
                    one you find on the kiosks around town, you know.</p>
                <p>Then I edited also for the Historical Society a huge illustrated history of the
                    Supreme Court, published a couple of years ago, which was kind of fun because my
                    son did the photography. It was our first partnership between hard cover,
                    although we do journalistic work together from time to time. My son, Lee, is a
                    professional photographer here in Washington.</p>
                <p>Now I've just learned that proofs are coming in on another project involving the
                    Court, a collection of speeches and public statements by retired Chief Justice
                    Warren Burger, which I've been working on as editor for a couple of years. So I
                    do a few projects of that time in terms of editing.</p>
                <p>To talk about retirement, I've managed to get myself so broadly committed that I
                    sometimes threaten to go and get a job so that I can rest up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Burnett, it's hard to imagine a more satisfying career
                        than yours. I thank you for the time for this interview. I've enjoyed it and
                        I've learned more about you, although we've known each other for many years.
                        We always exchange information.</hi>

                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: We have, indeed, Jack, and it's a pleasure and a stimulus to sit down
                    like this. I'm not much given to looking back, you know. I take Satchel Paige's
                    advice, “Don't ever do it. Something might be gaining on you.” But I've enjoyed
                    this occasion very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thanks again.</hi>
