                <p>An interview with Rutherford M. Poats</p>
                <p>Interviewed by W. Haven North</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: January 13, 1999</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is January 13, 1999. The interview is with
                        Rutherford M. Poats. Briefly, how long were you with AID in your
                        career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Overview of career with USAID</p>
                <p>POATS: I joined AID almost at its inception in December 1961. I had as a
                    journalist reported periodically on the evolution of thinking about the creation
                    of a consolidated economic development agency in the U.S. government to replace
                    the several elements of foreign assistance that preexisted AID. I came to AID
                    from a career as an economic journalist, principally in the Far East where I
                    covered the economic aspects of the occupation of Japan and its subsequent
                    resurgence. I also covered some aspects of the political and economic evolution
                    of the Republic of Korea as a war correspondent. I worked in the Far East for 11
                    years before coming to Washington, where I did the same kind of economic
                    reporting with emphasis on international economic relations of the United States
                    with other countries. So, I came to AID in 1961 with that background and with
                    that interest in the processes of international economic cooperation.</p>
                <p>Early years and education</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we go into that in more detail, let's go back
                        earlier so people understand where you are from, where you grew up, and
                        anything about your early education.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: I don't think my early education particularly oriented me toward
                    international development. I grew up in Spartanburg, South Carolina, moved from
                    there as a teenager to Atlanta, Georgia. I attended Emory University, where I
                    majored in economics and journalism, a mixed major. I had an accelerated
                    graduation from Emory in 1943. In the Army, I ended up in the Far East at the
                    very end of World War II and became the editor of a magazine that was published
                    by MacArthur's headquarters. I therefore was in the rear echelon of the
                    MacArthur headquarters when it moved into Japan at the end of 1945.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in Japan, you were doing journalist
                        work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Military assignment in Japan and Korea - 1945</p>
                <p>POATS: Initially, I was doing some journalism in MacArthur's headquarters. I was
                    there when all of the colonels and majors were leaving as fast as “points”
                    permitted them to go home. I was a young captain in the Troop Information and
                    Education Section of MacArthur's headquarters and found myself by want of bosses
                    to be both the officer in charge of the Armed Forces Radio Service news output
                    and the overseer of the daily newspaper published by MacArthur's headquarters
                    for the troops. In those roles, I also had to supervise and, to some degree,
                    participate in writing guidance documents, brochures, pamphlets, and so on to
                    orient the American troops on how to behave in Japan and Korea, how to respect
                    the local culture and that sort of thing. So, it was an excellent opportunity to
                    do some journalism while being a government official.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any events or experiences in Japan that stand
                        out in your mind on how that operation worked? Of course, it was very
                        significant.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: Of course, it was a generally highly successful effort to reshape a major
                    society and economy to a Western conception of a democratic social order and a
                    capitalist economic order. Korea was a different story, even though Korea had
                    traditionally recognized the critical importance of human resource development.
                    It put priority emphasis in governmental expenditures on education. It,
                    nonetheless, totally lacked political leadership oriented toward economic
                    issues, development particularly, but not just development — all aspects of the
                    economy. Syngman Rhee was trained as a theologian in the United States. He had
                    nothing but disdain for business, moneymaking or that sort of grubby business,
                    and was interested solely in enhancing Korea's independence as a logical
                    aftermath of a colonial experience under Japanese colonial rule. So, Korea was
                    still in 1961, when USAID became very important to its development, at lower
                    average income levels than Ghana at the same point in time. Rhee was succeeded
                    by a general who had no pretensions of economic wisdom, but he understood the
                    critical importance of catching up with Japan, of giving Koreans self-respect
                    through economic growth. He effectively employed the USAID Director in Japan,
                    Joel Bernstein, as his tutor on economic development. Bernstein would go twice a
                    week to the Blue House, the presidential mansion, and lecture the President and
                    a few of his aides on economic development principles, the role of foreign
                    investment and various technical innovations, and on accelerating and focusing
                    an economy toward broadly shared growth. This general, General Park, took it
                    upon himself to lead Korea toward a high rate of economic growth and set off to
                    catch up with Japan. He pursued that vigorously. He also did such useful things
                    as reforesting the whole countryside, which had been denuded by several decades
                    of deforestation and erosion. So, this dictatorial general had a major
                    contribution to make. He did it, of course, with an iron hand. After a while, of
                    course, that didn't sit very well with the populace. But he made a major
                    contribution. The lesson I took from that was that political leadership oriented
                    toward development and insistent upon organizing coherent programs for
                    development is more important than any other factor in development. That's not
                    to say that he could have succeeded without the prior and continuing investment
                    in human resource development, or without the critical contribution of foreign
                    aid, mainly U.S. aid. This was at a time when moving ahead to fill the gaps in
                    development that had occurred under the colonial period depended upon foreign
                    resources, foreign aid. They used that aid much more wisely. They used it under
                    much more persistent and invasive advisory roles of the USAID mission than was
                    true in most other countries. So, I drew from that experience a view of how aid
                    can work that influenced my thinking thereafter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This period you were talking about was the 1950s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: The 1960s. The 1950s were quite a different story. That was the period
                    when American aid was wholly rationalized and focused on Defense Support and
                    Supporting Assistance. The notion was, we would simply prop up the Korean
                    military establishment so that it could sustain the security of South Korea
                    during the truce. After all, there was no peace after the Korean War, which
                    ended in 1953. There was an armed, highly vulnerable border stretching roughly
                    along the 35th Parallel. The U.S. policy was to strengthen Korea's capacity to
                    defend itself so as to avoid inviting renewed attack from the North — triggering
                    an action that would involve the United States, which retained forces in
                    Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a significant economic dimension in that earlier
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>POATS: The economic dimension was this: we funded the defense budget. We did that
                    by providing resources in the form of goods shipped into the country under
                    Supporting Assistance funding. This meant that Korea had little incentive to
                    generate foreign exchange through exports to pay for essential imports and had
                    no incentive to induce foreign investment to expand the economic base. After
                    all, the economic base was artificially maintained by this level of Defense
                    Support. That would have not been sufficient for a government eager to achieve
                    development, but for Syngman Rhee, that was just fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the time when Korea was described as a basket
                        case, without hope.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: Yes. Of course, that was absurd. Korea had great potential, mainly human
                    resource potential, which was actually suppressed by this Defense Support
                    policy. That was changed abruptly just about the time I came into the Far East
                    Bureau of AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What brought about the change?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: Finally achieving acceptance within the U.S. government that this was a
                    wrongheaded policy. This had been the view of ICA in the last couple of years of
                    ICA's existence, but it did not have the clout in the government to bring about
                    the change. The Defense Department and the State Department always overruled the
                    ICA's arguments. It was only when AID existed and we had a different
                    relationship with the White House from that point on. We had in Korea a very
                    tough, some would say autocratic, AID Director, Jim Killen. Back in Washington,
                    Sy Janow was the head of the Far East Bureau; he knew Korea well from commercial
                    experience in Korea. We were able to shift the whole thrust of the program away
                    from supporting the defense budget to supporting programs of development. That
                    came along only when Park was there, ready to accept that reorientation.It would
                    not have been possible under Syngman Rhee. So, these two forces happened to
                    coalesce.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very interesting. Back a little bit on Japan. I
                        assume you knew General MacArthur in that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: Of course, I was a very young person, low down in the ranks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you had exposure to him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: I was exposed to him, yes, and exposed, of course, to his successors as
                    well. Mainly, I knew General MacArthur as a reporter observing, reporting, and
                    commenting on the occupation policy's programs.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You spoke of that time, the experience of the occupation,
                        having a profound impact on the Japanese culture, society, and values. How
                        did that come about? That's something that comes up all the time in
                        development issues. Here we seem to have had a profound effect.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: MacArthur was a remarkable reformer. Again, nothing in his military
                    background would have led one to expect that he would become a leading liberal
                    in the sense of bringing about a transition of a whole society from a very
                    centralized autocratic structure both in government and in private life to one
                    which was open to change and to bottom-up efforts to bring about change. He
                    instituted, partly under instruction from the Allied Forces consultative process
                    in Washington and partly on his own initiative, a whole series of economic and
                    social reforms — most famously in the drafting of Japan's democratic antiwar
                    constitution. But he also the broke up the cartels, freed labor to form
                    effective serious labor unions, changed the curriculum of education at all
                    levels, and promoted the development of a free press, which became extremely
                    free as it went along, and so on. Many fundamental changes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There must have been something in the Japanese state of
                        mind that welcomed this or was open to this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: Yes. They did not resist, partly out of acceptance or resignation to the
                    realities of their defeat and partly because many sensible Japanese were, after
                    all, Western-educated and had never been able to exercise their own inherent or
                    Western-induced concepts of how a society ought to operate. The failure of the
                    military government of Japan obviously opened the way to trying something
                    different. The Emperor collaborated with this radical change. The people went
                    along obediently. They obviously had the right kind of political leadership at
                    the right time. It just was amazing. We did something for Japan in that period
                    of an economic development character that shouldn't be neglected. In a sense,
                    the first U.S. international aid programs were in Europe in the aftermath of the
                    war there, the Marshall Plan and the Greek-Turkish aid program, and in Japan
                    with what was called Government and Relief in Occupied Areas (GARIOA). That was
                    primarily the importation of American food, but it also included cotton for the
                    textile industry, other basic materials, and concurrently, running interference
                    for Japan in opening up markets for Japanese goods in the rest of the world.
                    Japan was feared and shunned at that time. It took some real assistance by the
                    United States to bring about a change in the receptivity of other countries to
                    Japanese exports. A lot of these things were aspects of an economic development
                    assistance effort by the United States even though nobody thought of MacArthur's
                    headquarters in those terms. It had a much broader mandate, of course, than
                    that.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Out of that experience, what brought you to want to get
                        into foreign economic assistance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: I think that suggests how my education had proceeded after leaving
                    college. When I came back to Washington, I was assigned to cover international
                    economics in Washington with the United Press, which at that time was a major
                    news agency subsidized by the Scripps family. I covered the White House, the
                    Commerce Department, the Treasury Department, the State Department,
                    congressional committees dealing with aspects of international economic matters,
                    trade, and so on.</p>

                <p>POATS: This was in 1957-1961, four years of economic news reporting in Washington
                    following those 11 years in the Far East.</p>

                </p>
                <p>POATS: The assignment that is directly relevant to your questions is this: I
                    followed, essentially on my own initiative, the discussions on the Hill, among
                    the aficionados of development cooperation, the ideas that were coming out of
                    the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
                    They were discussing how to make the U.S. contribution to development more
                    systematic, to consolidate the several different elements of the U.S. government
                    working in this area, and to give it more importance in the policy councils of
                    the U.S. government. People like Senator Church, Senator Javits, Congressman
                    Zablocki, Congressman Fraser, a number of early advocates of strengthening the
                    aid programs were consulting with people in the State Department on this subject
                    in 1960 and earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was driving them? Was there any particular overriding
                        motive or interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: I think mainly a sense of the optimism that dominated thinking at that
                    time about the capacity of government to make constructive change. This was,
                    after all, the era of liberal economic thought. We had had a successful World
                    War II experience, reoriented our enemies following the war, and restored
                    European economies through the Marshall Plan. Americans believed that if
                    right-thinking people put their resources together in some sort of collective,
                    energized effort, we could accomplish more. We looked out and saw the world that
                    we had inherited the leadership of after World War II, and there was much to be
                    done. The general tone was “We can do it. We can roll up our sleeves and make a
                    difference.” We shared a very positive notion of what the foreign policy of the
                    United States should be. It certainly included bringing about constructive
                    change of a political and social nature in the rest of the world and
                    particularly in the so-called underdeveloped countries of the world. After all,
                    they included most of the world in those days.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the communist “threat?”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>POATS: That was what finally triggered a great majority support for action, first
                    in the Marshall Plan to buttress the devastated continent of Western Europe
                    against what was already seen as a communist threat beginning with the bringing
                    down of the so-called Iron Curtain in Central Europe; and then secondly with the
                    victory of the communists in China in the Chinese Civil War, which culminated in
                    1949 with their control of all of China, and, of course, with its peripheral
                    communist countries on its border: North Korea, North Vietnam, and so on. Then
                    thirdly, the advent of Castro in Latin America in 1959. The earliest evolution
                    of this thinking about what to do about these threats was in the creation of the
                    Alliance for Progress, which was seen as a means of insulating and inoculating
                    the rest of Latin America against Castroism. Similarly, this thinking was
                    evident in Asia in the strengthening of the periphery around China under Dulles'
                    leadership in the Eisenhower Administration through alliances to contain China,
                    the Soviet Union and its satellites in Asia. Thus, fear that impelled the United
                    States' political leadership to look for tools other than military tools for
                    defense against what was seen as a global monolithic threat of communism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, it was both the fear aspects, but also a euphoria and
                        a positive view of what could be accomplished?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: We would have never seen large-scale development aid as an effective means
                    of dealing with this problem if we hadn't had at that time confidence in
                    government to a greater degree than I think we have today. We were confident
                    that government could mobilize institutions, people, and resources to focus on
                    problems and bring about an accelerated process of relief, a reduction of these
                    problems. Aid was a major mechanism by which we could apply ourselves to these
                    tasks around the world. We had a global view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular themes or emphases prior to the
                        formation of AID that were being debated and proposed by these groups who
                        were starting this process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: Yes, there were debates. The debate continues. There were debates among
                    those who thought that technical assistance, giving our know-how to people,
                    don't give them a loaf of bread, but teach them how to raise wheat, etc. was the
                    way to proceed. Therefore, let's just stick with the ICA, which was essentially
                    that kind of agency, the successor to the Point Four Program. Others, who were
                    champions of the Development Loan Fund (DLF) and ICA capital grants, saw the
                    task as accelerating the development of infrastructure and related institutions
                    through loans transfer of capital, offsetting the shortage of savings and
                    foreign exchange, particularly in the developing countries, by providing loans
                    which would be more or less conventional, but on longer terms than they could
                    get in the private market. An adjunct to this debate was: you've got the World
                    Bank and we're about to develop the Inter-American Bank. Why not just put a lot
                    more money into those institutions for lending on a multilateral basis to these
                    countries? But there was another element that was more important in U.S.
                    government thinking in both the Executive Branch and the Legislative Branch.
                    That was this point I made earlier about fear of communism. If we ought to focus
                    aid on the priority areas of concern to us in a security sense, a bilateral
                    program that is closely related to our own foreign policy and defense apparatus
                    is preferable. Then we can target our aid on the countries where there is the
                    greatest threat or vulnerability to communist influence and incursion. So, that
                    made the initial conception of AID heavily concerned with what was then called
                    Supporting Assistance for the countries that needed support in their defense
                    against internal or external communist threats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were talking about the emergence of the AID format.
                        Who were the people and what was the process that brought AID into being? I
                        assume that you were writing reports about this sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>POATS: Yes. There was a small group in the Mutual Security Office on the seventh
                    floor of the State Department that had the leading responsibility for putting
                    together a prospectus, an outline of objectives, and ultimately legislation, to
                    create a consolidated aid agency. They brought into it control over Supporting
                    Assistance, Development Assistance — both technical and financial — absorbing
                    the existing DLF and ICA programs. They also included in it effective control
                    over the food aid program, but not responsibility for its budgeting. It was
                    wisely assumed that the Agriculture Department could get more money for food
                    aid, since it was conceived and seen as a support for stabilization of domestic
                    agricultural prices. Finally, the Peace Corps, which was just being established
                    in the less than year old Kennedy Administration under the
                    President'brother-in-law, was allowed to stay outside of this consolidated
                    structure. It was even allowed to retain a certain independence from
                    coordination by the new aid agency at the insistence of its friends in the White
                    House. So, that was one of the debates that was resolved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the other economic assistance institutions?
                        There was the Ex-Im Bank, Treasury's role with the World Bank, and so on.
                        That came up later, but was this an issue at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: The Ex-Im Bank was not seen at that time as an aid agency because its
                    mandate was to selectively support exports of U.S. goods in those areas where
                    there was a competition for a market that was subject to support by other
                    governments' export subsidy programs. So, that had to have its own mandate and
                    administration and to be seen that way by the public and Congress. Treasury's
                    control over U.S. Participation in the multilateral institutions was resolved in
                    favor of Treasury's retaining the lead role, but a development coordinating
                    committee was set up with the Administrator of AID as the Chairman of that
                    committee. So, the Treasury was under sort of a leash imposed by that committee
                    — nominally at least. That is how they bridged that little problem. But as the
                    multilateral agencies in later years became more important and proliferated, the
                    Treasury's role gradually grew and the Development Coordinating Committee fell
                    into disuse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the thoughts about the structure of AID?
                        You talked about the integration of the Development Loan Fund and the other
                        programs, but how did it compare with its predecessor, ICA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: There was a much greater emphasis on regional management as opposed to
                    technical management. In ICA, the princes of the realm were the heads of the
                    technical units. In AID, the princes were the assistant administrators for
                    regions. They were given under the first three AID Administrators considerable
                    discretion in designing their programs and presenting them to the Congress. The
                    AID presentation book was a set of sections that were largely drafted and
                    determined by the regional Assistant Administrators without too much
                    intervention by the Administrator. I was in the Far East Bureau, where I was
                    responsible in my first job for drafting the AID presentation to Congress on
                    programs in the Far East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's come back to that in a minute. What was your view of
                        all this going on? You obviously were closely aware of all the changes and
                        the processes. Apart from straight reporting, did you have sort of your own
                        view of all these changes?</hi>

                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>POATS: I had great enthusiasm for the Kennedy Administration at this moment, not
                    just to go into AID, but to go into the Kennedy Administration. This was a way
                    to do so without being another flack, another public relations officer retreaded
                    from being a reporter. So, this was an opportunity that I grasped for that
                    reason. But I quickly became convinced that we were onto something very
                    important, that AID had a very important role in our foreign policy in that
                    period, and that it was indeed often central to the national priorities of
                    sustaining and strengthening countries against the threat of subversion and
                    against the longer-term threat of poverty Joined USAID as Special Assistant for

                    to become the head of the Far East Bureau. This friend, Seymour Janow, asked me
                    to come in with him because he was, at that time, a stranger to Washington. I
                    had been there four years and knew a lot about the State Department, the

                <p>POATS: The Far East was subsequently called East Asia. It meant the countries
                    from Burma eastward around the bend of Asia to Japan and south Korea, including
                    the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, South Vietnam, and Taiwan.</p>

                </p>
                <p>POATS: Two areas of great potential, opportunities for early success — success as
                    measured, I should say, by Dave Bell, the second Administrator of AID, who came
                    in fairly soon after Fowler Hamilton. He measured success in terms of graduation
                    from concessional aid. How fast a country can fulfill the development goal of
                    reaching self-sustaining economic growth. He believed that countries that were
                    just entering upon industrialization and social change could be accelerated in
                    that process by collaboration with external sources of finance and technical
                    advice so that they could reach a level of self-sustaining growth, no longer
                    dependent upon highly concessional transfers of resources. So, looking around
                    the circuit, it was quite clear that Taiwan was a potential candidate for
                    graduation, and Korea might be at some point.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they receive assistance while you were in the

                </p>
                <p>POATS: They were already receiving heavy Supporting Assistance, Defense Support
                    from ICA, getting substantial Development Loan Fund loans as well, and getting
                    Food for Peace transfers as well. So, those were two obvious opportunities. I
                    focused a great deal of my attention on them, partly due to the fact that I knew
                    something about them. I had worked in both those countries as a reporter over
                    many, many years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved then in the graduation of Taiwan? How
                        did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: I indeed was. I never will forget flying out to Taipei in 1965 (when I was
                    Assistant Administrator for the Far East) to give the government the news that
                    we had decided to phase out Supporting Assistance over the next 18 months and
                    that we would supplant that with a one-shot endowment in the form of local
                    currencies generated by previous programs. We would agree the local currency
                    earnings would be a source of income for certain agreed programs, mainly in the
                    field of international educational exchange. They, of course, were not eager to
                    lose this nice handout from Uncle Sam. So, I was greeted after a
                    straight-through, red eye flight from Washington to Taipei with a big dinner
                    party given by the Prime Minister, C.K. Yen, who was the boss of their economic
                    program. He was a first class development economist among other things. He had a
                    14 course Chinese dinner for me. After about five or six courses and many
                    drinks, I literally fell asleep on his shoulder sitting next to him at his
                    dinner party. I wasn't quite as disgraceful as President Bush was on a similar
                    occasion in the mainland of China some years later. I woke up the next morning
                    and went through with the ordeal informing him of this decision. I found that
                    the Prime Minister was not at all nonplused by this, although some of his staff
                    were. He readily accepted that the termination of AID grants was a recognition
                    of the success of Taiwan.</p>

                </p>
                <p>POATS: That was the way it was presented and that's the way he bought it. So much
                    of our relationship with Taiwan in that period when I was involved from 1962 to
                    1965 was similar to this. For example, even though Taiwan was doing very well,
                    it still had some strong military elements in the government that were
                    determined to spend every available Taiwan dollar on the military — and for some
                    legitimate reasons. After all, they were threatened constantly with attack from
                    the mainland. Nonetheless, there were people in the government who were devoted
                    to long-term economic security as the basis for real security for Taiwan. These
                    people we discovered included the Prime Minister, but not President Chiang
                    Kai-Shek. So, the USAID Mission on our instructions proposed a 12 point program
                    of policy commitments which would be the condition for continued U.S. Supporting
                    Assistance in 1963-64. Instead of resistance from the government, back came a
                    request from C.K.Yen, privately transmitted to the USAID Director there, Wes
                    Haraldson, to add four more points to our request. So, it became a 16 point
                    program, publicly seen as imposed by USAID upon his government.</p>

                    cooperation that was so rarely found in other countries where people resisted
                    IMF, World Bank, and AID dictates. Here, they were collaborating with us to
                    impose additional conditions on their fellows in the government.</p>

                <p>POATS: For the State Department and the White House as well. Dave Bell had
                    considerable influence in all of those quarters. After all, he had been in the
                    Truman White House as a young economist. He had been the first Budget Director
                    in the Kennedy Administration. He had very close relations with the Secretary of
                    State. So, this all was a concerted effort to begin to focus U.S. aid on the
                    countries that needed it.</p>

                        being expended in other parts of the world. Was that part of the program? Do
                        you recall anything about the purposes and programming of that

                <p>POATS: It was used to support international training, primarily sending Taiwanese
                    here, receiving short-term professional assistance from U.S. universities,
                    research centers, and so on, in Taiwan. It was not a lot of money in today's
                    terms. It was significant in those years for a while. Of course, Taiwan's
                    development moved ahead so rapidly that it was soon just a blip in their
                    budget.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about some of the other countries you were working on
                        at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: Indonesia was a major concern of the State Department and the White House
                    in those days because Sukarno, somewhat like Syngman Rhee, was wholly oriented
                    toward the politics of independence, again fresh from the Dutch colonial
                    experience, and determined to achieve the trappings of sovereignty — such things
                    as great public squares, monuments, infrastructure, and so on. The country was
                    not progressing economically at all. It had a rapid population growth rate and a
                    very low level of education. So, we were concerned that Indonesia was not
                    getting ahead and we were just simply pouring money down the drain there.
                    Although it was not large in terms of the scale of the country, the program was
                    substantial. So, that was an anxiety. We collaborated with the World Bank, the
                    IMF, and several bilateral aid programs, and ultimately formed a Consultative
                    Group (Aid Consortium) for economic cooperation with Indonesia under the
                    leadership of the Dutch. Strangely enough, the Indonesians had no problem with
                    Dutch chairmanship of the group. That was my first experience with systematic
                    international cooperation for coherent influencing of recipient and donor
                    policy. Well, we didn't get very far with this until Suharto came in; he brought
                    in a group of economists who were largely graduates of the University of
                    California at Berkeley, the so-called Berkeley Mafia. These people were trained
                    by Ford Foundation grants to the Ph.D. level. I don't think there was any single
                    program I ever heard of, in the international aid field, that was as cost
                    effective as that Ford Foundation program for training probably no more than a
                    dozen Indonesian economists to the Ph.D. level. All of them went to work on
                    aspects of national development under Suharto. They were the people with whom we
                    could collaborate in this consultative mechanism and bring about much more
                    effective use of World Bank, IMF, USAID, Dutch aid, and all the rest. They made
                    a difference. They could not have been in office and have had that kind of
                    authority under Sukarno. So, here again, political leadership and economic
                    policy competence in key institutions proved crucial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a good observation. And some of the other countries
                        that you were concerned with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: Of course, Vietnam became the dominant concern of the U.S. government and,
                    naturally, AID. By the time we were brought into the war fully, we had already
                    had a very large scale Supporting Assistance program since the late 1950s. It
                    was support for the military establishment of Vietnam, and it grew in the early
                    1960s when we began to ratchet up our military involvement through the expanded
                    Military Assistance Group (MACV). AID was, in effect, funding the defense
                    budget. That one program soon greatly exceeded all the rest of our aid in all of
                    East Asia and ultimately was probably equal to all the rest of aid in the world.
                    I've forgotten the numbers now. In any event, it had some of the same problems
                    that we had seen elsewhere. It certainly was not a time to focus on development.
                    It was a question of survival of the country — or the government. AID was
                    brought into the nation building efforts led by the U.S. military establishment
                    and the CIA as paymaster, and provider of manpower, and some rural development
                    skills. We funded and to a considerable degree staffed the provincial operations
                    — village improvement — provincial and other development efforts throughout the
                    country. Of course, I spent a good part of my time traveling back and forth to
                    Vietnam from Washington, spending extended periods there trying to make sense of
                    it. But it was clear that this was quicksand. Our money was simply dissipating
                    in the tides of war and in the corruption that was rampant in the country. We
                    were frustrated by the lack of commitment on the part of the government of
                    President Diem and his successors to rational economic management. So, I became
                    an internal critic of the effort, but, of course, had my duty to carry out. One
                    of my duties was to troop up to the Hill with Secretary Rusk as his economic
                    bag-carrier and answerer of questions on economic details during his almost
                    continual Congressional appearances in those years. Of course, I also had to
                    defend the AID budget to the appropriations and authorizing committees of
                    Congress. There, I remember getting into serious dutch with my political bosses
                    when I acknowledged, in answer to a series of questions by Congressman Reigle in
                    the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations Appropriations, the truth of his
                    allegations about corruption and misuse of AID and government funds in Vietnam.
                    Reigle later used the information to declare his break with the administration
                    on Vietnam. I survived that somehow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But we were trying to do development, I guess, in the
                        provinces.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: Yes, we were trying to do development with one hand and fighting a war
                    with the other. We certainly put a lot of effort into a number of grass roots
                    programs: pigs for the farmers, watermelons, roads, all kinds of programs,
                    trying to give the peasants a sense of hope, progress, and an alternative to the
                    entreaties of the communist cadres who were all around and among them.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>POATS: Oh, no, it was absolutely washed away. I would say that the program had a
                    negative effect on economic development in Vietnam in the long term sense.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why a negative effect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: Because there was no incentive left to make long term investment
                    commitments when the USAID was there to provide the money to build anything, do
                    anything, you name it. If it was halfway plausible as a means of strengthening
                    the society and showing support for the government and showing the government
                    had a capacity to respond to the people's needs, we did it. So, there was
                    nothing left in the way of a Vietnamese self-sustaining effort. That's not a
                    criticism of AID or of development so much as a recognition that the
                    circumstances have to be right for development aid to be positive. It can easily
                    be negative if it discourages the development of private enterprise, discourages
                    long-term rational investment, encourages idle fancies in banking.</p>
                <p>New challenges as USAID Deputy Administrator - 1966</p>
                <p>POATS: Let me turn now from that early experience in AID in the Far East to a
                    later experience when I became the Deputy Administrator at the end of 1966 and
                    quickly shed the dust of Vietnaand involved myself in other parts of the world
                    as fast as I could. I spent a lot more time thereafter on Latin America, South
                    Asia, and, to a lesser degree, other parts of the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the Latin American issues you were concerned
                        with? This was as Deputy Administrator?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: Yes. At that time, in the late 1960s, we were nearing the end of the first
                    decade of the Alliance for Progress and were beginning to see some successes and
                    some shortcomings. The real problems in much of Latin America were undisciplined
                    expansion of money supply, which led to inflation and the expectation of further
                    inflation, which was, in some respects, more important than the actual realities
                    of excesses by government. There also was the problem of retrogression in the
                    movement toward democracy. A number of countries had backslid into military
                    regimes in that period. So, the Alliance was brought under question. At the same
                    time, the Inter-American Development Bank and its soft loan program had become
                    more important as a source of support for these countries. Also, at the same
                    time, much of our AID budget had been diverted to Vietnam and to Israel. So,
                    there was not as much money for AID to make a difference in these relatively
                    large economies of Latin America as had been the case at the outset of the
                    Alliance for Progress. The smaller programs of the Alliance for promoting the
                    development of local civil society had had their day and had become reasonably
                    well established as indigenous operations by that point. So, the Inter-American
                    Bank and the World Bank had become the primary sources of development assistance
                    to Latin America. As a consequence, increasingly, the role of the AID people was
                    to supplement and seek to influence those other, larger sources of aid on how to
                    make an effective impact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In our earlier period with the Alliance, do you think we
                        made a difference in Latin America?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: Yes. There is evidence during the mid-1960s that the Alliance was making a
                    significant impact, mainly, I think, on reorienting political priorities,
                    values, to development and helping people define what constituted the
                    underpinnings of successful accelerated development and what constituted errors
                    in that process. This was a learning period for both them and us. We made plenty
                    of mistakes. But I think at the end of about six years, it was fair to say that
                    the Alliance had become truly an alliance for progress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the main instruments or ways in which we brought
                        about this change of view ?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>POATS: I think we made good use of the institutions that previously existed, the
                    Inter-American institutions, including the Inter-American Bank and the Latin
                    American arms of the IMF and the World Bank. We had a very good integration of
                    development action in our own administration. The Alliance for Progress was a
                    function of the Latin American Bureau of the State Department. In a large sense,
                    it had its AID staff and it had AID budgeting disciplines and so on, but it was
                    fully integrated. The head of that bureau was always, in this period at least, a
                    keen devotee of international development cooperation. Some first-class
                    development managers were the heads of the State Department's Bureau for the
                    Alliance for Progress. That was important. It had its negatives, of course, but
                    I had no trouble in later years accepting the idea of much closer integration of
                    State and AID. Indeed, I never found reasons to object to Senator Helms' recent
                    forays on that subject. I think there is a lot to be said for it. Obviously, it
                    can run wild if the State Department dominates it with short-term political
                    considerations. But with the right kind of leadership in the State Department
                    and the right kind of collaboration and the right kind of oversight by the White
                    House and the Congress, I don't fear it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm jumping ahead a little bit, but that's one of the
                        questions that comes up in many of these discussions: the interaction of
                        State's short term political security interests and our interest in
                        long-term development. Do they complement each other or is the aid process
                        compromised by short term political interests? How would you view that
                        question?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: Well, I've seen both sides of it, obviously. I've seen the worst of it in
                    the early days in Korea and in Vietnam for an extended period. I've seen it in
                    Egypt as well. I was in a later period (1975-1977) the Executive Director of
                    U.S. Economic and Technical Commissions with the Middle Eastern countries. The
                    Joint Commission with Egypt was the forerunner of the reestablishment of the
                    USAID Mission in Cairo. So, I was involved in the reestablishment of the aid
                    program in Egypt and observed it in that role for several years closely and then
                    later at more distance. I must say that the fixation on maintaining a certain
                    level of aid for Egypt, at a notch below our aid to Israel, insured that neither
                    of these programs was driven by development policy criteria. This struck me as a
                    reversion to the old days of Supporting Assistance. Indeed, much of it was
                    funded by Supporting Assistance in recognition of the fact that it was
                    essentially a political program. I think it was wasteful in the aggregate for
                    that reason, not that there weren't some good things done in Egypt, but highly
                    wasteful in the sense of the aggregates involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the political side wasn't wasteful, I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: No, but in terms of Egypt's own interest, I suspect, it was poorly served
                    by that kind of openhanded check writing policy. So, I've seen that as the worst
                    aspects of a State Department dominated aid program. But again, I would say that
                    those are cases that would arise even if AID was, as it is in the case of Egypt,
                    independent. It takes its orders, after all, from the President if not from the
                    Secretary of State, which increasingly it does as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you find other cases where they complement each other,
                        that the political has been supportive of development efforts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: Yes, I think certainly the collaboration of the State Department
                    ambassador and his country team with the AID Director is crucial in almost every
                    country. The participation and active intervention of the ambassador, and often
                    his political and economic counselors, can make the difference between a
                    marginalized AID operation and a central one. Even where our resources are not
                    very great, that can be true. For example, in Eastern Europe, I would say that
                    the successes of AID assisting in the transformation of those countries from
                    communism to market economies depended very largely upon this integration of the
                    U.S. country team and its collaboration with the other sources of foreign
                    assistance, particularly the World Bank and the European Bank for Development.
                    So, this reinforced my idea that State-AID integration can and must work,
                    especially where AID has become almost negligible as an economic factor in a
                    host country's development. AID has no possibility of having any meaningful
                    entr�e to the opinion and decision-makers except through its role as a partner
                    of the ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to your Deputy Administrator role. Were
                        there other dimensions of the program you were concerned with? What were you
                        trying to bring about in that role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: I got into two or three specialized areas in that period. One had to do
                    with the development of the research program for population assistance. This
                    was, after all, a relatively new role for the U.S. government. The tools we had
                    to work with were quite primitive in the late 1960s. Through the initiative of
                    the Rockefeller Foundation and the Ford- Rockefeller-funded Population Council,
                    a consortium of universities and agencies for thanalysis of population issues
                    and definition of technical research targets was established.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this something that you helped sponsor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: I was the AID representative in the group. It met periodically in AID
                    under my chairmanship. I was not an expert on the subject, but had that
                    role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the primary initiatives that you were trying to
                        bring about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>POATS: We were trying to increase the allocation of both U.S. government research
                    funds (NIH, HEW, AID, and others) to programs of contraceptive technology
                    development, but also to get other governments to do this as well. There was a
                    group in Sweden of a similar orientation with which we worked to bring Europeans
                    into the program, without great success because their political leadership was
                    very skittish about intervening in such issues for religious and political
                    reasons. But we did greatly increase the allocation of AID and HEW research
                    funds to population programs including grants to U.S. private institutions and
                    quasi-private institutions such as universities and research centers and to
                    programs of adaptive research and social science research in developing
                    countries. This was a way to stimulate the creation of cadres of activists for
                    this cause in developing countries through the guise of research. It led from
                    that point onward into bigger and bigger programs of operational assistance for
                    population programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Population programs at that time were reasonably well
                        supported by Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: Yes, actively supported.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it as controversial as it has become?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: It did not become controversial for a number of years. It did ultimately,
                    but only when we got too noisy about it. For example, we had quite effective
                    programs in wholly Catholic countries with Catholic leadership in Latin America
                    and in the Philippines and in Muslim countries such as Pakistan without any
                    great difficulty in the early years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your understanding of the key ingredients of
                        these effective programs? What accounted for their being effective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: A handful of local leaders who worked within the medical establishment to
                    extend these programs as aspects of rural community development and health
                    assistance and at the central level in the universities and research centers.
                    Working with the local pharmaceutical industry and the population officers of
                    governments did a great deal, with some advice from Americans, to commercialize
                    the business of production and distribution of contraceptives, for example. That
                    was a major enthusiasm of mine in my period as Deputy Administrator. Another was
                    the extension of country-level aid coordination beyond that which we had
                    initiated with the World Bank primarily the lead — in India, Pakistan, and
                    Indonesia. It was then extended to Colombia and various other countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were Consultative Group functions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: Consultative Groups or coordination groups. They were essentially the same
                    thing. A couple of them in India and Pakistan were called consortia. They had a
                    sort of formal pledging operation to make it a consortium. It was somewhat less
                    formal and less rigorously disciplined in the other cases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did those work? There is new interest now in reviewing
                        the aid coordination business and Consultative Group and Round Table
                        processes. How did you find those worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>POATS: Like any institutional integration, it proved to be less effective than
                    the theory in every case. Again, going back to my example of Taiwan, an aid
                    coordination group worked best where the country's finance minister had the
                    support of the local prime minister and clear authority over the economic levers
                    of the country, including the various subordinate ministers who had their own
                    budgets and priorities. Where you had, therefore, a strong, centralized
                    government with a powerful finance minister who was committed to the cause of
                    accelerated development, it worked. Lacking that or when there was a change and
                    a new man came in and wasn't invested with the same ideas, it dissipated badly.
                    We also had the problem of the political and commercial interests of bilateral
                    donors interfering with the pure developmental purposes of the exercises. So,
                    you would have nominal agreement in the Consultative Group in Kenya, for
                    example, (I recall this one vividly) to refrain from wasteful programs,
                    frivolous initiatives by various ministers. Then within a few months, you
                    discovered these same bilateral aid agencies were up to the same old tricks. In
                    other words, there was no discipline in the Kenyan government and no discipline
                    on the part of the members of the Consultative Group to adhere to the deal. Part
                    of this was due to the fact that export credit agencies played a large part in
                    this. They never considered themselves really bound by the developmental
                    concerns.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do any of the donors stand out in your mind with this
                        problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: Oh, yes, I can name many of the leading European donors and Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The U.S. was not part of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: The U.S. was almost wholly blameless on this subject. Occasionally, there
                    would be some argument from the ambassador that we really shouldn't be so
                    stiff-necked about all this. But I think, by and large, Ex-Im Bank, partly
                    because it didn't have a lot of money to throw around in developing countries
                    anyway, was likely to be a purist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that being high-minded or was that just because we
                        didn't have the resources?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: Oh, it's much easier to be high-minded about export credit matters if you
                    don't have much money and if you want to put the money into major markets rather
                    than minor African markets and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We weren't aggressive in developing those markets.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: There was a period when we were so upset by the competitive zeal of our
                    export credit competitors from other countries that we set up war chests. The
                    White House and the Treasury wanted to throw money at projects that were about
                    to be stolen from us by a subsidized credit offered by some other country. Well,
                    we never really put much money into that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It never functioned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: It functioned. But it certainly had very little to do with development, I
                    know that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. Any other dimension of the Consultative Group
                        process? People are very interested in this topic nowadays.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>POATS: I spent a lot of time on this in one of my subsequent roles, but let me
                    first turn to the next role, which was related to this. That is first as Vice
                    President and then subsequently as Acting President of OPIC for 18 months. This
                    was in the beginning of the Carter Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OPIC was once in AID, was it not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: Yes, and I was Acting Administrator when we put forward the legislation to
                    separate the private enterprise and investment promotion arm of AID, the Private
                    Enterprise Bureau, and create an independent government corporation, OPIC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did we want to separate it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: We decided that would be desirable because we wanted to create an
                    institution that functioned like a political risk insurance company and could
                    engage openly, freely, in legal actions to protect its insured investors without
                    directly bringing the U.S. government into the fray. We also wanted to have an
                    institution that could develop its own income and resources and apply them to
                    create a bigger guarantee pool to protect against losses in the insurance
                    business. We wanted to have a development lending function that was not
                    dependent upon the guarantees of the host government so that it would be a
                    project lender based upon project analysis, taking risks in the way that an
                    investment bank takes risks. We thought those functions could not be performed
                    very well inside AID, which was oriented toward government to government
                    programs, although not entirely, and was a creature of the annual appropriation
                    process. We wanted something that was independent of the appropriation process,
                    able to make its own decisions and to make or break on the basis of sound
                    business judgement. That was accepted by the Congress. Mind you, this was put
                    forward at the beginning of a Republican administration, the Nixon
                    Administration. I was still in the government at that time. It was put through
                    in 1969. It didn't come into being actually until about a year and a half later
                    because of a dispute with its principal godfather on the Hill, Senator Javits,
                    over who was going to be its first president. He was determined to have his man
                    as the first president. The White House was determined to have somebody else.
                    So, it was slow getting started.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were president?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: No. Not at that time. The first President of OPIC was Bradford Mills. I
                    did not take charge of OPIC until the beginning of the Carter Administration in
                    1976.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you created OPIC, did that mean that AID no longer
                        had any responsibility for private investment? Was there some function
                        left?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>POATS: AID continued to have responsibility for private enterprise development in
                    the sense of support for and influencing policies and institutions to encourage
                    the proliferation and growth of private enterprise in the recipient countries.
                    But the support of through insurance, loan guarantees, and direct loans to U.S.
                    direct private investment projects in developing countries was transferred to
                    OPIC. I was there for 18 months as Senior Vice-President and Acting President. I
                    went from there to the National Security Council staff in the White House under
                    Jimmy Carter, where I was responsible for some aspects of international
                    economics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to your Deputy Administrator function. Was
                        there any other dimension of that assignment? Were you trying to bring out
                        any changes within the organization or structure of AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: The Administrator at that time was first Bill Gaud, who was a very
                    experienced hand having been the Assistant Administrator for Near East/South
                    Asia and then the Deputy Administrator for a number of years. So, he didn't need
                    a great deal of coaching on how to reform AID. He had his mind pretty well fixed
                    on that subject. Then when John Hannah came in, I was the Acting Administrator
                    for several months until he actually came on board in April of 1969. Then Hannah
                    quickly delegated to me great chunks of the administration because they weren't
                    of interest to him. He heartily disapproved of the idea of the U.S. government
                    making loans to poor countries. The idea of being a loan collector when the
                    payments came due was offensive to him. He just didn't want any part of that.
                    So, all the loan business and all the old loan collection problems he
                    transferred to me. He also had a quite sensible attitude toward police
                    assistance to countries that did not operate under the rule of law, did not have
                    an effective constitution or an effective juridical process that insulated the
                    people from outrages of a police state. So, he was very much opposed to many of
                    the AID programs that stemmed from the Cold War era of assistance to police
                    forces engaged in sundry activities in support of a local dictator or strong-arm
                    government. So, one of our major tasks was to phase out some police assistance
                    programs. Of course, this encountered considerable resistance in the State
                    Department, and it occupied a lot of our time for a while. There were other
                    specialized tasks that I undertook for Hannah in the year and a half or so that
                    I remained in the government after the Nixon Administration come into office. I
                    left in June of 1970 to take a fellowship at Brookings and write a book on
                    technical assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll come to that in a minute. During that time, you must
                        have spent a lot of time on the Hill testifying and so on. How was your
                        experience working with Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: I think I had more intensive time on the Hill in the preceding period. I
                    don't think Deputy Administrators in that day were called upon much by thHill.
                    They looked to the Administrator or to the Regional Administrators essentially.
                    As I said earlier, I was on the Hill constantly when I was Assistant
                    Administrator for the Far East, particularly during the whole Vietnam ordeal,
                    endlessly on the Hill for that. A whole series of investigative committee
                    hearings on corruption in Vietnam, for example, occupied a lot of my time. I was
                    in hot water with Senator Bayh because he accused AID of wasting money in
                    Vietnam by buying galvanized iron sheet in Korea instead of in Gary, Indiana.
                    That led to a whole set of hearings about the AID operation in general.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did those kinds of issues just fizzle out after
                        discussion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: They finally fizzled out, yes, the whole series of investigative hearings.
                    Bayh, in fact, hired a person who did almost nothing but dig up more dirt on AID
                    in Vietnam for six months. So, you can spend a lot of time on the Hill in that
                    sort of thing. But the Deputy Administrator in that administration (I suspect
                    that was true in the subsequent ones.) was not called to the Hill nearly as much
                    as the Administrator or the Assistant Administrators for regions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the congressional view of the
                        development function of AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>POATS: It had its ups and downs, but I think it was dominated, as was so much of
                    foreign policy, by preoccupation with Vietnam. As the Vietnam situation
                    deteriorated and the popular opinion of the policy in Vietnam ran deeply against
                    the government, then any aid program was cast in that light. So, we had an
                    increasingly negative response, I think, and an increased yearning on the part
                    of our friends on the Hill to recast AID in images other than those associated
                    with the past.</p>
                <p>Joined the Brookings Institute to write a book on technical cooperation -
                    1970</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said you left AID on a sabbatical. When was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: In June of 1970. I went to Brookings on a Federal Executive Fellowship for
                    the purpose of writing a book on technical cooperation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What led you to write that book?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: I mentioned to you the interest in population assistance, which I had
                    become deeply involved in. Another factor was the then exciting prospect of the
                    Green Revolution that had been occasioned, as you know, initially by the success
                    of the Rockefeller research projects in the Philippines and in Mexico on grains.
                    That had led AID to see what it could do to provide greater support for
                    follow-up and adaptive research in countries that were falling behind in the per
                    capita grain production effort. I took advantage of the opportunity to go and
                    write a book which was published by Brookings in 1971 called “Technology for
                    Developing Nations.” This was an attempt to define a sort of strategy or scheme
                    for more research-based, longer-term technical assistance. Out of that kind of
                    thinking, which other people had as well as myself, came the idea of creating a
                    separate technical assistance agency, sort of going back to the old days but in
                    the form of a government foundation with long-term funding and insulation from
                    political pressures. Henry Owen, who was my division chief at Brookings at that
                    time, the head of the foreign policy side of Brookings, pursued this idea when
                    he was in the NSC staff. It never got off the ground. It was tried on the Hill
                    for about a year. It was called the International Science and Technology
                    Institute (ISTI). It never was accepted — wisely, I think — by the Congress
                    because it might have diverted us from the need to consolidate limited
                    resources.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your consideration of technical cooperation come up
                        with some reservations about its effectiveness? Was that a factor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: I analyzed each of the sectors and our work in each of the sectors over
                    the preceding 20 years and tried to draw some conclusions that were relevant to
                    the work of people in the business at that time. This was a book for
                    practitioners; how to do it better. So, I had a lot of recommendations that, of
                    course, people who had had the role of Deputy Administrator of AID think they're
                    free to spout off. After having read books in Brookings that I should have read
                    before going to work for AID, I felt suddenly much wiser about many of these
                    things than I had before. Indeed, one of the lessons that I drew that I pass on
                    to anybody who ever listens to these tapes is that there should be much more
                    enforced, required, in-service training of AID technicians and managers. They
                    don't take time to do it right. There are very few academic programs that
                    prepare one for this business of intervening in the processes of economic policy
                    making and institution building in strange cultures. We need much more cultural
                    sensitization in the AID staff, much more current exposure to the thinking of
                    outsiders both in foreign countries and in our own country, much more awareness
                    of what is being done and thought about in other development donor countries
                    such as France, Japan, Germany, and so on, and much keener appreciation of what
                    has happened and what has worked and hasn't worked on that part of our people
                    who are experimenting with other people's lives and other people's money. So,
                    much more of this kind of taking time out for short term sabbaticals, I think,
                    would be money well spent in the AID administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess this was about the time when AID was beginning to
                        move out of our technical functions and turn them over to contractors.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: Yes, and that was one of my enthusiasms at that time. I think it has gone
                    further than I had in mind. But I certainly advocated then tapping the expertise
                    of private and quasi-private institutions much more extensively, partly because
                    some of the best long-term technical assistance thaICA sponsored or that AID
                    sponsored was indeed run by land grant colleges, the Population Council, other
                    such specialized quality institutions. Whether there are enough to do all these
                    other tasks, I don't know. But I found in the fields of industrial finance and
                    agricultural finance, for example, potential for all sorts of involvement of the
                    private or civil sectors of the United States in development operations. I
                    explored all those possibilities and encouraged much greater use of those
                    resources.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were supportive of this trend away from pure
                        direct-hire technical staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>POATS: Yes, I thought there was much greater scope for the US private sector than
                    we had explored.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You then moved to the White House?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Served as Vice-President for Policy in the Overseas Private Investment
                    Corporation - 1971-1974</p>
                <p>POATS: No, I went from there to OPIC for several years as the Vice President for
                    Policy. The reason for that was wholly unrelated to my wisdom on investment
                    insurance. I had been the Deputy Administrator and Acting Administrator at the
                    moment when the U.S. copper companies had sought to activate their AID
                    investment insurance against the expropriation of their properties by the
                    government of Chile in 1970. I had been the one to tell them, “No, your policies
                    are not in effect. AID will not indemnify you.” These companies had taken
                    advantage of a foolish clause in their contracts with AID which permitted them
                    to put their insurance on “standby”, meaning they didn't pay any premiums, but
                    they had the right to reactivate the insurance any time in the future. But at
                    the time they were expropriated, the insurance was legally inactive, our lawyers
                    said. We stuck to that. Of course, they went up in smoke because they had
                    insured $750 million of their copper investments with AID. Had AID attempted to
                    pay this, AID would have been out of the business of investment insurance and
                    OPIC would never have been created. Along comes OPIC about that time. The OPIC
                    president, Brad Mills, knew that I had been involved in this and he wanted
                    somebody to help him defend OPIC against the copper companies' suits against
                    OPIC based on the stance that I had taken originally when this program was under
                    AID. So, I was called in after finishing my sabbatical to be sort of his left
                    hand man on defending against these suits, which were taken to arbitration
                    against OPIC. We lost these suits. They won in arbitration. But they realized
                    that OPIC had no capacity to fully pay these claims. Furthermore, these
                    companies by that time saw the advantage of not totally alienating themselves
                    from the Chilean government. So, they accepted some ingenious schemes put
                    forward by others in AID than myself, entailing installment settlements of these
                    claims. These were in the form of all-risk guarantees of Chilean government
                    bonds for installment compensation for these expropriations. Well, what do you
                    know? This was a highly contentious innovation but it was accepted by all,
                    including the U.S. Treasury. Over the years, the Chilean government paid off
                    these bonds. OPIC never incurred a single loss and indeed made a profit on the
                    premium it charged on its guarantees of the bonds. It worked out as a model for
                    others, including MIGA, when I was a consultant in the creation of the
                    Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency in the World Bank some years later.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was essentially to shift the responsibility to the
                        recipient country or the developing country?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>POATS: Yes. Most failures to compensate for expropriations are driven not by
                    ideological passion, but by lack of money. The recipient countries can't afford
                    to fully indemnify the foreigners that they expropriate. If you find a way for
                    them to do it on an installment plan and still retain international good
                    standing in the financial community, they'll tend to do it just as they tend to
                    try to not default on international debts for the same reasons. That was part of
                    what I was doing in OPIC in that period. </p>
                <p>Transferred to be Economic Advisor to the Deputy Secretary of State - 1975</p>
                <p>POATS: Then I went from there to the State Department as Economic Advisor to
                    Charles W. Robinson, the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, who soon became
                    the Deputy Secretary of State. My primary task there was to direct the staff
                    work and supervise the setting up and operation of joint economic and technical
                    commissions with Middle Eastern countries: Egypt, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Iran,
                    and Tunisia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was their purpose?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: They were set up at the instance of Henry Kissinger, who was then the
                    Secretary of State, and run, in effect, by Chuck Robinson and myself and various
                    senior people around the government. For example, the one in Saudi Arabia was
                    run by Bill Simon, the Secretary of the Treasury. I managed the Washington
                    committee process for coordination and providing resources to them. The joint
                    commissions were set up at the instance of Henry Kissinger and President Ford
                    primarily to ingratiate the United States with the OPEC countries. In order to
                    give it a broad enough cast so as not to reveal clearly that intention, they
                    threw in Egypt, Israel, Tunisia, and India. But the primary target was to wean
                    Iran and/or Saudi Arabia away from OPEC. Kissinger thought that by helping them
                    out on their development efforts, working with them on aspects of their economy
                    other than oil, we could have a good dialogue with them on oil policy and could
                    even succeed in causing them to sell us oil at discounted prices. This was, mind
                    you, during the oil crisis. Of course, that didn't work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did these commissions do in fact?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: They organized a lot of collaboration between ministries of those
                    countries and departments of the U.S. government and a few private institutions
                    in technical fields. The Saudis used it more extensively than others. They tried
                    and to some extent succeeded, in getting the joint commission staff to help them
                    select the best U.S. sources of technical services and technological
                    materials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was part of the reimbursable aid program then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>POATS: It was wholly paid for by the Saudi government, including the salaries of
                    U.S. Treasury Department commission staff people living in Riyadh. But when push
                    came to shove, we legally could not tell the government how to rate one U.S.
                    company versus a competing U.S. company. That would clearly violate our laws and
                    we had to formally abstain from that. But I don't doubt that, privately, there
                    were certain hints and nods given from time to time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It had something of a development role then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: Oh, yes, it was a development function. It was a predecessor of the AID
                    operation in Egypt. It had a bearing on what became subsequently AID technical
                    collaboration with India and Tunisia. It was a major operation for a while in
                    Iran. Of course, it suddenly ended with the overthrow of the Shah. The Shah was
                    a great enthusiast for this program.</p>

                        concern? Was it mainly industrial or other?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: Pretty well across the board. We had all of the sectors of development
                    involved in some degree such as health, education, agriculture, water resources,
                    ecological preservation, and so on, the whole range. So, you had various
                    government agencies, maybe 20 in some cases, involved in a single joint
                    commission meeting in a country.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: AID was part of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: AID was part of it. AID participated in several of the subgroups. But they
                    were generally led by technical departments and their counterparts in the other
                    country.</p>

                <p>POATS: Yes, I think some of them created some lasting linkages between
                    institutions. They got to know who was good at what in this country. They
                    realized that most of our experts were indeed that and had no ax to grind and
                    were helpful. Of course, some of them were pretty expensive. I worked on the
                    joint commission program in 1975 and 1976, then went to OPIC as Acting
                    President, then to the NSC staff, and finally to the DAC. Appointment as
                    Chairman of the Development Assistance Committee of OECD - 1981-1986</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the DAC job come about? During the Reagan
                        Administration, you got the job of the DAC Chairman.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: I remained on the NSC staff during the transition from the Carter
                    Administration to the Reagan Administration. For most of 1981, I worked on trade
                    policy and then was selected by Peter McPherson, the AID Administrator, to be
                    nominated by the President to be the U.S. Chairman of the DAC. I followed sort
                    of a tradition of former AID Deputy Administrators becoming Chairmen of the DAC.
                    At the end of 1981, I went to Paris, and I was there for a little over four
                    years as the Chairman. In 1985, I produced under OECD auspices a 25th year
                    anniversary survey of the experience of international development cooperation, a
                    book on development cooperation during the Development Assistance Committee's
                    25-year history. I'd like to just cover the highlights of my summation of that
                    history. I think it's a good way to put in perspective what we have been talking
                    about in a somewhat personal fashion. The first point I'd like to make and did
                    make in this summation is that we began the whole era of development cooperation
                    with the assumption that preindustrial and largely stagnant economies could be
                    launched on a course of dynamic economic and social transformation ultimately
                    sustainable without prolonged dependence on concessional aid. Further that this
                    process could be set in motion, broadened, and accelerated by the efficient use
                    of internal and external resources in combinations appropriate to particular
                    cases in an environment of policies and leadership conducive to sustained
                    development. That notion, that belief, was grounded in the optimism I referred
                    to earlier that dominated the thinking of governments pretty much around the
                    world in that period and was driven to some degree by a sense of necessity to
                    provide a noncommunist, liberal response to the challenge of communism, which
                    sought to answer the impoverishment of the majority of the people in the world
                    with a totalitarian, statist solution. So, this was a political mission. A
                    missionary zeal drove it. I don't think anyone was fully confident outside the
                    circles of those directly engaged in this program that it would succeed. But the
                    fact is that 25 years later, looking back on that period, we found very strong
                    evidence that growth had been accelerated, that per capita GNP [gross national
                    product] growth had exceeded substantially the rate of per capita GNP growth in
                    the industrialized countries in either the same period of development or the
                    last 25 years. Secondly, the other indicators of development had equally shown
                    progress — in the average life expectancy, reduced child mortality, literacy,
                    primary school enrollment, and so on. So, development had been greatly
                    accelerated in a variety of counties in all regions. Now, that doesn't say that
                    development aid could be credited with this. Indeed, it shouldn't be credited
                    fully with it. It was no better than a catalyst, an inspirer, or an important
                    supplement in all cases. But, if one looks at the record there, as I did in this
                    summary, one finds that in fact development did become the paramount objective
                    in many countries that had previously been mired in stagnation and indifference
                    to such considerations, that social development was given a higher place
                    politically in these countries, and that a joint objective of development for
                    common goals had become the binding relationship between the United States and
                    many countries of the world, something like 70 or so countries. Development aid
                    is more difficult to analyze and measure as to its success. But we did have a
                    number of studies about that time (1985-1986) which gave encouragement to the
                    view that development aid indeed had made significant contributions to economic
                    and social progress, as reflected in national development policy, the
                    strengthening of public institutions, the opening of opportunities for private
                    enterprise to grow, and impact on poverty, even though on the latter subject,
                    there was much room for modesty, to say the least. But we did recognize that
                    that was a task yet inadequately fulfilled. But I concluded that much aid had
                    made a significant contribution to development. The sources of the early cases
                    of ineffective aid had been identified and to a large degree were being
                    corrected. Among the particular cases I examined in this area was the special
                    case of sub-Saharan Africa, the most difficult of all of the cases, where the
                    margins for economic adjustment were so limited that the financial dimensions of
                    the African crisis as a part of the global recession of the early 1980s could
                    not be reduced in the short term. It clearly entailed a much longer term
                    commitment and a much greater appreciation of the cultural and political
                    handicaps that these countries were experiencing. The most plentiful resource
                    potential and the most abused resource clearly was in agriculture. There, the
                    policies of sub-Saharan African countries despite much entreaty, inducement, and
                    pressure by the aid agencies including the World Bank still fell well short of
                    providing strong incentives to farmers, particularly small scale agricultural
                    producers. Private enterprise was clearly another neglected development resource
                    that we then recognized. We set out to do much more about it in the subsequent
                    AID programs, as you know - but not just by USAID, but by all concerned. It no
                    longer was contentious as it had been for many years in the political
                    discussions in the African setting that private enterprise had to be given
                    priority. This despite the fact that still we found in this period when I was
                    surveying Africa more closely that it was not regarded by most of the elite of
                    Africa as a worthy ambition for one of their sons to become a businessman. He
                    should be in government, be a bureaucrat, have a place, a position, not a job.
                    This was a very serious social, cultural impediment. The overextension of the
                    public sector which we talked about much in the subsequent years was most
                    vividly evident in Africa, where the public sector had naturally come into
                    dominance because of the impatience of the post-colonial regimes to get on with
                    replacing the old colonial institutions and agencies and companies with whatever
                    was available. What was quickly available was to create a public institution or
                    to strengthen one. That, of course, suppressed opportunities for the private
                    sector and created opportunities for massive abuse and corruption. The reversal
                    of all that entailed recognition by political leaders of the role of private
                    sector enterprise. That isn't easy to bring about in any society, particularly
                    where the options of replacing it may often be another oligarchy that is almost
                    as monopolistic and free of competitive pressures as the original state
                    enterprise. So, the task was recognized as far from successfully fulfilled in
                    the Sahel and generally in sub-Saharan Africa. The development record in Asia
                    and in Latin America was much more encouraging, I concluded. I mentioned already
                    the successes in Korea and Taiwan, but generally speaking it can be said, I
                    think, that when we look at the world today, we are looking at graduates, at
                    countries that are either ready to or nearly ready to join the community of
                    industrialized democracies. That's true of Mexico and Korea that have already
                    joined the OECD. It's true of those that are candidates for near membership such
                    as Braziand Argentina. It's certainly going to be true of some others. Thailand
                    has had its serious setbacks, but I think it will recover. In Latin America, one
                    sees vibrant responsive republics that are committed to a market economy. That's
                    clearly true in Asia with the exception of the political side of the
                    transformation that is taking place in China. In South Asia, I want to emphasize
                    and did emphasize in this paper, the importance of the Green Revolution
                    technologies as triggering change toward a very optimistic view of what can be
                    done by concerted action in the research area. That, as I said, led to a wider
                    appreciation by all the DAC members of the potential for and need to focus on
                    long-term institution building and support of agriculture and of greater
                    attention to the creation of opportunities for growth in the small business
                    sector and the private small farm sectors of these countries as essential to any
                    effective attack on poverty. We were left at the end of a generation-long
                    experience in development cooperation with an agenda that still had much
                    challenge in it, particularly to free and stimulate the creative energies of
                    small farmers and private entrepreneurs to bring about the equivalent of a
                    technological Green Revolution in other crop fields, to improve public
                    administration where its lack has been a serious brake on development efficiency
                    and welfare, to extend, while making more effective and affordable, basic public
                    and private services for human resource development, to make universally
                    available the opportunity to regulate human fertility, to protect the natural
                    resource bases of development from ecological degradation, and to bring women of
                    developing countries more fully into the planning and execution of development
                    programs and enjoyment of their benefits. This I saw as the agenda for the
                    future when I left office in early 1986. I think I can say that that agenda is
                    still reflected in the focus and priorities that one sees in the aid programs
                    not just of the United States, but of most of the partners in development. The
                    partnership is increasingly important to the United States, I would argue,
                    because our resources for development have declined in proportionate and real
                    terms, whereas the problem still is there in many parts of the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the decline of our resources, does that mean a
                        decline in U.S. influence in the international development agenda?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: Yes, I think that's true. I know that in my own experience, we had
                    enormous influence where we had very significant resources to offer that were
                    clearly important to the political interests of the government and of its
                    members, very important influence where we were important to the plans of an
                    institution such as a university to amend its curriculum or to improve its
                    research programs. When we become a marginal player, one of many small
                    contributors, obviously, we are appreciated but not listened to when it's
                    inconvenient. I saw that in Eastern Europe, where I worked for a while as a
                    consultant after these other jobs. It seemed to me that not just USAID, but most
                    of the bilateral agencies, were not second fiddle; they were third or fourth
                    fiddle to the World Bank and to the European Development Bank.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your role in the DAC, how did you see the influence of
                        the U.S. in relationship to other donors?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>POATS: It retained influence despite the fact that in the DAC measurement of aid
                    effort, the United States dropped lower and lower and lower until finally when I
                    was there it was down to about the level of Ireland, near the bottom of the pack
                    in terms of the percentage of per capita GNP or GDP [gross domestic product]
                    devoted to aid. Despite that, the United States was recognized as a source of
                    wisdom and experience on how to do it and a country that had a remarkably clear
                    record on putting development high on its agenda, if not always first. They took
                    pot shots occasionally at our enormous disproportion of AID program funds that
                    went to a rich country, Israel, as opposed to the poor countries. Nonetheless,
                    when AID people attended specialized meetings of the DAC, they often had more
                    valid lessons to convey — in terms of what works and how to make it work — than
                    the representatives of any other country. In a consultative forum, that's a very
                    important influence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular areas during your time there
                        that you were focusing on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: There was one that you know much about. I wasn't particularly innovative
                    here at all, but I was certainly concerned with it and interested in it. That
                    was the strengthening of the evaluation functions of aid donors and applications
                    of the findings of evaluations in the programming of additional aid. I think the
                    evaluation consultative subcommittee of the committee of the DAC did some useful
                    work in stimulating professionalism in this aspect of aid management. I think
                    that was true also of its work on women in development, where we started with a
                    sort of simplistic, naive notion of “We've go to do something about this problem
                    because the women are on our backs about it” and soon recognized that, hey,
                    there can be some real benefits from making this concept a central part of our
                    planning and management. That change of mindset occurred to a much lesser degree
                    in the DAC, I think, on population programs. Here the DAC was frustrated
                    repeatedly by the reluctance of several countries, notably a leading aid donor,
                    France, to embrace population programs as an essential part of development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other initiatives at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>POATS: I mentioned earlier and I'll repeat in this context, coordination. The
                    DAC, of course, was created for the purpose of coordination, but the initial
                    idea was rather simple. It was to coordinate at the level of policy and
                    budgeting and try to put pressure on each other to do more and do better. The
                    idea of coordination that evolved, particularly while I was there (and I suppose
                    it's been continued), is to improve the processes of sectoral and country
                    coordination of donors so as to achieve more impact for limited amounts of local
                    and foreign resources in a particular country or in one sector of a particular
                    economy. The improvement of the mechanisms for these specialized consultative
                    operations was a particular interest of the DAC and of its annual reports and of
                    our meetings. I think we had considerable influence on the donor community in
                    getting it to agree to the leadership of usually the World Bank, but in some
                    cases other institutions, in these specialized consultative operations that were
                    extended quite widely.</p>

                        have a desirable function or has it outlived its usefulness?</hi>

                <p>POATS: Once you leave an institution, you think it's gone downhill from that
                    point on or going off on some voguish tangents. So, I can't be regarded as
                    authoritative on this. My impression from reading the Chairman's annual report
                    is that the DAC has tried to stay abreast of the new waves of interests in the
                    development business and these have led it to spending a lot of time on trying
                    to define what constitutes sustainable development and how to strengthen the
                    civil society and so on. These formulations are useful in reviving interest on
                    the part of specialized outsiders in helping the least developed countries.
                    There is much less political imperative in an industrialized country's capital
                    to give aid to a multitude of small, poor countries now that the more
                    interesting and more potentially rewarding developing countries have made it to
                    the ranks of the near industrialized, near rich. So, I would think it's much
                    more difficult now for the DAC to perform its role than it was in the past and,
                    in that sense, it's more important that the United States remain committed to
                    the cause. Once the United States loses interest in something in an
                    international setting these days, it's very likely that others will diminish
                    their participation as well. I think we've seen that.</p>
                <p>Various consulting assignments - 1987</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about some of your other career experiences?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>POATS: I don't think there's much I could say about my experience with the World
                    Bank. I was focused wholly on the business of setting up a new subsidiary of the
                    Bank, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, which I came to because of
                    my experience in DAC and my experience in OPIC. I was the consultant to the Vice
                    President/General Counsel, Ibrahim Shihata, who was the true founder and creator
                    of MIGA. I was his consultant, advisor, drafter, promoter, and so on. I was the
                    interim manager of MIGA until its first Executive Vice President came on board
                    at the start of MIGA in 1989. MIGA is one of several developments in the World
                    Bank Group in the direction of strengthening its role in private enterprise
                    development. The World Bank Group's effectiveness in these roles has, I think,
                    been quite high. Its influence on the policies of developing countries toward
                    private sector development has certainly been more pervasive than could have
                    been the influence of national donor agencies. The fact that MIGA was created
                    and that MIGA is prospering and has been renewed, extended, and expanded, shows,
                    I think, that this aspect of development is now fully in place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is international investment guarantees?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: Not just that, but in the broader sense of support for the transfer of
                    resources for productive private enterprise development. MIGA, after all, has a
                    technical assistance function as well as an investment guarantee function.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How does that relate to the IFC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: They are very close collaborators. In fact, my initial proposal when I was
                    Chairman of the DAC was that MIGA be created as an additional function of the
                    IFC, but it didn't go that way and it's too late now to reverse gears on that.
                    But MIGA and the IFC do collaborate with the Bank and support a wide range of
                    private enterprise development efforts </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said you worked on Eastern Europe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: I went on from the MIGA job to setting up a consulting firm which had two
                    ex-AID people in it. This firm has primarily advised governments in Eastern
                    Europe, including the seven states of the former Soviet Union, the “stans,” on
                    how to make their economies more attractive and receptive to private foreign
                    direct investment; and secondarily, to assist them on developing particular
                    institutions for promoting particular sectors of development to the outside
                    world, to potential investors. We had a number of projects in Poland, Hungary,
                    Czech Republic, and Russia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of projects were you proposing and
                        promoting?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>POATS: We worked largely in institutional development programs in the public
                    sector, creating and strengthening foreign investment promotion entities of the
                    Ministry of Commerce or the Ministry of Industry or wherever it was lodged and
                    helping them to learn from the experience of others so as to set it up properly
                    and to address the institutional and financial functions outside the purview of
                    these little offices to maximize the potential of those countries to attract
                    foreign investment. It was a logical follow-up to my work on MIGA, which had
                    that general function as well. I did some consulting work, as consultants always
                    do, for their ex-institution as they came up to their need for additional
                    resources and need for adjusting their technical assistance operations to meet
                    the needs of their members. That's pretty much what it was.</p>
                <p>Concluding observations on international development </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's look back a bit. Looking over your long career in
                        foreign assistance, do you feel it made a difference? Has it been effective?
                        You've implied that it has in many cases. What is your overall
                        conclusion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: I think anyone who has worked in foreign assistance should feel proud of
                    his work and his efforts to make a difference. I think the whole cause was a
                    very positive mission that we had as individuals and we had as a nation. The
                    fact that it's a cause adopted by all of the other industrialized democracies, I
                    think, supports that belief. The fact that it's reflected in the strengthening
                    of the multilateral agencies and the proliferation of private operations in this
                    field beyond charity to development, as endorsed now by UNICEF, CARE, and many
                    others speaks to the same point. So, briefly, it's been a cherished experience
                    and one which I'm sure that new entrants into public service should consider
                    because there is much yet to be done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what areas of AID's foreign assistance work do you
                        think we've made our most distinctive contributions over the last 30 years
                        or so? Where do you think it's had the greatest impact?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: I think probably the greatest contribution in any development area is in
                    the creation of competence in the society in which we are working to perform
                    these tasks themselves. That entails both training in the conventional sense and
                    more pointedly, the orientation and strengthening of institutions that can apply
                    skills to these countries' problem-solving. So, I'd say institutional
                    development and human resource development must have made more impact in the
                    long term than the other parts of our effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your work on population and some of the agriculture
                        areas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: Yes, these are aspects of the same point.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that still should be a thrust or a primary interest?
                        You don't hear so much about institutional development now. You hear about
                        it, but people sort of poo-poo it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: My guess is that it's more and more difficult to persuade the recipients
                    that they need external help on this; that we have any ideas yet to be imparted
                    to them. That must be a great frustration for the development business these
                    days. I'm sure there is a lot more that can and should be done in the way of
                    institutional twinning and research collaboration with a view to improving
                    performance, but I suspect it's not recognized on either side of the
                    partnerships as necessary these days, although I think it still is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any feel for the future directions of
                        development assistance type work and whether it should be changed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: I don't pretend to be sufficiently aware of current thinking and current
                    analyses to be on top of that question. I've told you what I was recommending at
                    the end of my active involvement. So, clearly, I'm out of the current stream
                    now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's still relevant to today?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: It's to some extent relevant, but I can't be sure that I could name the
                    three or four steps if I were trying to design next steps in AID's career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you sum up your own experience in AID and in
                        foreign assistance? How would you characterize that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POATS: My experience in AID was almost wholly positive with the exception of the
                    frustrations one has in trying to ride two horses at the same time. When you
                    have the Cold War imperatives that dominated the program through much of my
                    career and the Vietnam era and, to some degree, the early stages in Korea, Latin
                    America, and Egypt, that clearly diverts resources and minimizes effectiveness.
                    That sounds like an alibi perhaps for shortcomings of the AID operation. But it
                    was clearly a weakness and a source of disappointment. Despite that, I think,
                    overall, we have been party to a very fruitful acceleration and broadening of
                    development around the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a good point on which to end. Thank you very much.
                        It's been a fascinating interview.</hi>
