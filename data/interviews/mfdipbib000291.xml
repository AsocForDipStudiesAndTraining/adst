                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Being interviewed in Washington, DC, is Dr. Dorothy
                        Dillon, retired Foreign Service Officer, USIA. Dr. Dillon, who received her
                        doctorate in US and Latin American history at Columbia University in 1947,
                        taught at Sweetbriar College and Rutgers University. She came to Washington
                        in 1948 and worked at various government agencies before joining the Office
                        of Intelligence Research (OIR) of the Department of State in 1951. In 1953
                        she transferred to the newly-established US Information Agency. In 1960, she
                        joined the Foreign Service of USIA, working initially with the State
                        Department's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. In 1963, her first
                        assignment abroad was as cultural attach� and deputy PAO in Guatemala,
                        followed by an assignment as cultural affairs officer in Manila. She later
                        became USIA policy officer for Latin America, then deputy assistant
                        director, and in 1973 assistant director for Latin America.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>She retired from USIA in 1978, but has been active in Latin American affairs
                    since then, including service as Director of the Washington Center for Latin
                    American Studies from 1978 to 1982. Since 1984, she has been a member of the
                    Foreign Service Grievance Board. She is also a contributing editor of the Times
                    of the Americas.</p>
                <p>Dorothy, please begin by telling us how you happened to join the Foreign Service
                    of USIA.</p>
                <p>DILLON: Well, it goes back a long way. I was supposed to go into the Foreign
                    Service of the Department of State in 1948 when I left Rutgers University. But
                    the Department had budgetary problems that year, and therefore had to withdraw
                    its offer to me to join the Foreign Service as a reserve officer. So I went to
                    the Library of Congress for a year as director of a bibliographical project on
                    Latin America for the UN, and then went over to the Office of Reports and
                    Estimates of the Central Intelligence Agency for about a year and a half as an
                    intelligence analyst on Latin America.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Meanwhile, I had met at various meetings the then-Chief of the Latin American
                    Division in the Office of Intelligence Research (OIR) of the Department of State
                    who said that he would like me to come over as an analyst in his division as
                    soon as he had a slot available. This happened in 1951. In that year I went to
                    the Department of State as an intelligence analyst.</p>
                <p>I also became involved in what was at that time called the Coordinator for
                    Psychological Intelligence. So in effect, I had two jobs. I was the Coordinator
                    for Psychological Intelligence for Latin America and an analyst for the area in
                    the Latin American Division of OIR.</p>
                <p>In 1953, when the United States Information Agency was set up in the Eisenhower
                    Administration, most of us who were in the Coordinator for Psychological
                    Intelligence office moved over to the United States Information Agency and
                    became the nucleus of USIA's Office of Research and Intelligence (IRI).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the Civil Service at this time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: I was in the Civil Service, right. Now, at that time, we had the option
                    of either staying in the Department of State or going to USIA. It was also the
                    time of the so-called Wristonization program in the Department of State. People
                    in the Civil Service were being encouraged to go into the Foreign Service, and
                    those of us who were considering going to USIA were being urged by the personnel
                    people in the State Department to go into the Foreign Service at State.</p>
                <p>In my case, for family reasons at that time, I was not ready to go into the
                    Foreign Service, and it seemed to me very clear that career options would be
                    extremely limited in the Department of State if one did not go into the Foreign
                    Service. So consequently, I decided to go with USIA, the new agency. In effect,
                    I became the Latin American branch of the Office of Research and Intelligence in
                    USIA, while other people were being recruited.</p>
                <p>Eventually, a Foreign Service officer was brought in as chief of the branch and I
                    became his deputy. Then, in 1956, he moved to another assignment and I became
                    chief of the Latin American branch in IR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is now the Office of Research in USIA, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: Yes, the name changed over the years, but it was originally called the
                    Office of Research and Intelligence. It was the research arm of USIA and
                    included activities such as media reaction studies, public opinion polling,
                    keeping track of Communist propaganda activities around the world, etc.,
                    etc.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>I believe I was the first woman to become a branch chief in USIA. After two years
                    in that job, I was offered the opportunity to become deputy director of IRI and
                    that is where I ran into the first real problem with respect to discrimination
                    against women.</p>
                <p>Encountering Discrimination AgainstWomen in Higher Positions</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was deputy director of the whole office, not just the
                        Latin American branch?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: That's right. (The Latin American branch was in one of the divisions
                    within IRI.) Although the director of IRI wanted me as his deputy, my
                    appointment was vetoed at higher levels in the agency. As far as I am aware, the
                    director of the agency was not involved and did not know anything about it.
                    Also, the then-director of personnel was not aware of the situation. In any
                    case, a compromise was struck; someone else was put into the deputy director
                    job, and I was made deputy chief of one of the divisions in IRI, with the
                    understanding that when that division chief would leave, I would then become the
                    division chief. The thought was that perhaps feelings against having a woman as
                    a division chief might be less strong than those against having a woman as
                    deputy director of an office, a higher level position.</p>
                <p>In any case, what happened was that a new director of IRI came in who was clearly
                    not interested in having any women in senior positions, and so I knew that my
                    path was blocked there. I was casting around to see what my options might be. I
                    was offered a job in publishing in New York, and I considered that. I also
                    considered going back to academic life.</p>
                <p>Then one day, just by chance at lunch, I happened to run into L.K. Little, who
                    was then the Director of Personnel in USIA. We had lunch together, and I told
                    him what my situation was. He said he didn't know anything about what had
                    happened to me, but suggested that I might consider joining the Foreign Service
                    simply to get out of this particular situation. He also said it would give me
                    greater flexibility in terms of assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Foreign Service considered more liberal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: It wasn't. No, as a matter of fact, although I was supposed to go into
                    the Foreign Service in the beginning of my career in government, I had since
                    that time leaned that there was great discrimination against women in the
                    Foreign Service. However, I did have to get myself out of IRI because my career
                    was completely blocked. It was also a very uncomfortable situation.</p>
                <p>1960: Entrance Into Foreign Service</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>So I decided, in any case, to try for the Foreign Service, and I was paneled
                    eventually and accepted. This was in 1960. There wasn't any assignment in the
                    field in Latin America at that time that was really suitable, so on my own, I
                    went over to see some of the people in the Bureau of Educational and Cultural
                    Affairs in the Department of State, and they offered me an assignment over there
                    on their planning staff. I stayed there for roughly two years until finally an
                    assignment opened up in Latin America, and the then-assistant director for Latin
                    America offered me the assignment of cultural affairs officer in Guatemala. I
                    went there in January of 1963.</p>
                <p>First Overseas Assignment: Guatemala, 1963</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we discuss Guatemala, I wonder if you'd tell us
                        anything about the feelings at State, since you were in Washington at the
                        time, with regard to the establishment of this new propaganda agency,
                        USIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: The way we understood it, the then-Secretary of State had no great
                    interest in keeping within the Department of State the cultural and
                    informational activities of the Department. He was happy to see them taken out
                    of the Department of State and put into a new agency.</p>
                <p>Senator Fulbright Opposed Putting Culturaland Educational Programs in USIA</p>
                <p>The only program that was left in the Department of State was the official
                    educational and cultural exchange program, and the reason that it was left in
                    the Department was because Senator Fulbright, who was very actively involved in
                    all of this, did not wish the educational and cultural program to go into what
                    he called “that propaganda agency,” meaning USIA. Of course, what the senator
                    did not realize was that overseas the people with whom embassy officials were
                    dealing didn't know the difference between USIA or the Department of State or
                    the man in the moon. And since the cultural affairs officers of USIA
                    administered the educational and cultural program overseas, in effect, they had
                    two masters in Washington. They were responsible to the Bureau of Educational
                    and Cultural Affairs, CU for short, in the Department of State, for the exchange
                    program and for the rest of the cultural program—they were responsible to USIA
                    in Washington. This lasted for a quarter of a century, until finally, in the
                    Carter Administration, the CU part of the Department of State was finally moved
                    over into USIA. After 25 years of separation, all of the cultural and
                    informational programs of the United States Government finally rested in one
                    agency.</p>
                <p>You recall for a few years the agency changed its name to the International
                    Communication Agency, but that didn't last too long and it came back to USIA
                    once again.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you tell us a little bit about your first
                        assignment, what Guatemala was like in those days, and what was the interest
                        of the US in Guatemala at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: Guatemala was a fascinating place. Ironically, it had been the country
                    that I was supposed to go to in 1948 when I had been offered the Foreign Service
                    reserve appointment by the Department of State, which didn't materialize because
                    of budget problems.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, I had visited the country on official business, and I was
                    delighted to go back. It was, of course, an interesting country, because in 1954
                    there had been the famous overthrow of the Arbenz Government, which was
                    considered by the United States Government to be Communist infiltrated. That is
                    to say, there were Communists in various important positions in the
                    government.</p>
                <p>1954-63: Polarization of Guatemalan Public:Pro-Castillo Armas or Otherwise</p>
                <p>As a result of that overthrow, there was a rather strange situation in Guatemala,
                    even nine years later in 1963, because there was still a considerable
                    polarization in the society between those who were considered to be pro-Castillo
                    Armas, who was the colonel who overthrew Arbenz and eventually became president,
                    and those who were not with Castillo Armas. Many people, as a result, had
                    curious things in their security files to the effect that they were
                    pro-Communist, just because they were not pro-Castillo Armas. Indeed, one or two
                    people on the USIS staff, that is, Guatemalans on the staff, even had problems
                    at the time of the overthrow of Arbenz, not because they were pro-Communist—they
                    were anything but, in fact they were very anti-Communist—but because they were
                    not pro-Castillo.</p>
                <p>One of the things that I found very strange was that although the US Government
                    had decided after the overthrow of Arbenz it would try to help the Guatemalans
                    build up democratic institutions in the country, including democratic labor
                    unions, in the nine years between 1954 and 1963, not one labor union leader in
                    Guatemala had been sent to the United States on an official grant. So I
                    immediately talked to our labor attach� and said that I would like to set aside
                    each year at least two slots for labor leaders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the international visitors program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: That's right. I asked him to come up with some suggestions, and then we
                    interviewed these people and eventually chose two leaders to come to the
                    university under the international visitor program. As I recall, I continued to
                    do that during my term there, my three years. I felt that that particular
                    segment of society had been very much neglected so far as our official program
                    was concerned.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DILLON: Very much so, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it like in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: When I arrived in Guatemala, some of my American colleagues who were
                    taking me around to introduce me to people, said, “Now you must come over and
                    see the IGA.” I didn't quite know what the IGA was first, and then I realized
                    they were talking about the binational center, the Instituto
                    Guatemalteco-Americano.</p>
                <p>At that time, the binational center was in an old rather run-down former hotel in
                    the center of the city, not too far from the USIS offices. I was a bit dismayed
                    by the atmosphere of the place, but it had an active program, though it didn't
                    have much money. Shortly after I arrived, a new American officer came down to be
                    one of my assistant cultural affairs officers and to be the director of the
                    binational center. I might say that at that time Guatemala had the largest
                    cultural program in Central America. I had three assistant cultural affairs
                    officers in addition to myself, so there were four Americans on the cultural
                    side plus a fairly sizable Guatemalan staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you say this was because of the political
                        situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: That was because of the political situation, yes. Guatemala was and is
                    also, of course, the largest country in the region in terms of population, so
                    from that point of view it would generally have the largest program. But in this
                    case, I would think it was the political situation. Also remember that in 1963,
                    we were still in the heyday of the Alliance for Progress. President Kennedy had
                    come to Costa Rica at that time; there was a great deal of excitement and
                    interest in John F. Kennedy, and a great deal of sympathy for him. He was very
                    well liked through Latin America.</p>

                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Just as a diversion here, I might say, I was in Guatemala at the time that he was
                    assassinated. Most of us in or out of the government generally remember what we
                    were doing when that happened. I was home at lunch and I got a call from our
                    information officer saying that the President had been shot in Texas. He didn't
                    know at that point whether the President was dead or not, but at least he had
                    been seriously wounded. I rushed back to the office, and by that time we had
                    gotten the word that the President was dead. Everybody, of course, was in a
                    state of total shock, but we all had to gear up for the work that had to be done
                    in connection with it.</p>
                <p>The Guatemalans started to pour into our office in USIA and pour into the embassy
                    expressing their condolences and asking what had happened and could we explain
                    it. It was simply a tremendous outpouring of sorrow and shock in the country. I
                    didn't leave Guatemala till January of 1966, and between November of '63 and
                    January 1966, I cannot tell you how many ceremonies and inaugurations I attended
                    of schools, libraries, clubs, etc., all named in honor of John F. Kennedy.</p>

                        before we move on to Manila, where you went in 1966?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: In those days, since it was the height of the Alliance for Progress, we
                    had a large program. We sent large numbers of university students on 30-day
                    grants to the United States and also large numbers of university professors and
                    people in other professions—journalists, other media leaders, artistic and
                    cultural figures and political leaders. We also had a group of about ten
                    American graduate students who came down each year under the Fulbright program
                    and were at San Carlos University, and several American professors who came down
                    under the Fulbright program to teach at the university. In addition to that, we
                    had, of course, American professors and others coming down for short periods of
                    time to participate in seminars, lectures, etc., etc.</p>
                <p>Establishing Useful Contact with Previously Unapproached Economics Faculty at
                    Guatemala's National University</p>
                <p>I think one of the interesting things about my time in Guatemala was that in
                    addition to not having sent any labor union leaders on grants before 1963, I
                    also discovered that nobody at the embassy had any contact with the faculty of
                    economics of the University of San Carlos, which is the national university. It
                    was supposed to be one of the most anti-US and, some would say, pro-Communist
                    faculties at the university. The faculty of economics, along with the faculty of
                    law and the faculty of humanities, were considered the most anti-US</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>I decided that I would try to make contact at the faculty, and I was looking for
                    a natural way of doing it. I received a notice from the Department of State in
                    Washington that a professor of economics from the University of Texas was going
                    to be traveling in the area and he would be available to come to Guatemala for a
                    few days. I was delighted with this, and I immediately wrote a letter to the
                    dean of the faculty of economics saying that this professor was coming and would
                    he be interested in having him talk to the faculty and to the students. Well, a
                    couple of days later, the dean was in my office and said, “Si, con mucho gusto,”
                    they would be delighted to have him come.</p>
                <p>As a result, we arranged for the professor to come. We set up a program for him
                    in Guatemala City and also in Quazaltenango. The day after he arrived, I had a
                    reception at my home for a group of the faculty members and student leaders to
                    meet him before his lectures.</p>
                <p>I didn't know the person who was coming; it was Calvin P. Blair, known as “Pat”
                    Blair. I really was buying a pig in a poke, so to speak, because I didn't know
                    just how simpatico he would be. It turned out he was perfectly marvelous. He
                    came with practically no voice because he had been in Mexico for several days
                    before arriving in Guatemala, and he had been up till 2:00 and 3:00 o'clock in
                    the morning discussing all kinds of economic and other problems with university
                    students. So I gave him a day to rest to try to get his voice back, and then
                    immediately sent him off beginning with this social event in my home, and then
                    going on to a series of lectures. It was just a marvelous beginning.</p>
                <p>As a result of that, I developed a very close relationship with the faculty, sent
                    a number of their professors and students on grants to the United States, and
                    also got the economic officers in the embassy and the director of the AID
                    mission involved with the faculty. As a result of that particular opening, we
                    were able to develop good relations with that faculty. As a matter of fact, the
                    dean asked for a Fulbright professor. Unfortunately, during my time, the
                    Department was unable to find a suitable candidate who could speak Spanish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who would spend a period of time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: And would spend a semester or a year. In any case, the point was we had
                    this opportunity. It was an example of how one cultural program can lead to a
                    number of other developments later on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That seems to be two excellent examples of the efforts
                        that USIS can make in connections and contacts.</hi>
                </p>

                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>DILLON: Exactly. And in fields, perhaps, which you might not think of, you know,
                    as being close to USIS. But I just happened to have an interest in labor unions
                    and one of my minor fields was economics, so therefore I was interested in the
                    faculty of economics, and one thing led to another.</p>
                <p>I think one other interesting thing to tell about Guatemala would be about one of
                    the professors in the faculty of law who had been the dean of that faculty back
                    in the middle '50s—oh, I guess either during or shortly after the time of the
                    Arbenz overthrow. He and some other deans had been invited by the United States
                    Government at that time to go on grants to the United States. It was part of the
                    effort of the US Government to develop good relations with Guatemalans after the
                    overthrow of Arbenz.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, he had a bad experience when he went to the interview for his visa
                    in the consulate, and as a result, he simply refused to go and walked out in
                    indignation. Now, I had known about this in Washington. When I came to
                    Guatemala, my senior assistant cultural affairs director, Bob Rockweiler, had
                    already been in the country for a year and a half, so he was instrumental,
                    naturally, in introducing me to many of the people that I would have contact
                    with in the future.</p>
                <p>He came to me one day and said, “You know, there's someone I would like, if we
                    could, give a grant—if we could work it out.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Who?”</p>
                <p>And he said, “Julio Cesar Mendez Montenegro, who is a member of the faculty of
                    law.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Oh, I know about him.” And I said, “Yes, I'd be very eager to give him a
                    grant if we can persuade him to take it.”</p>
                <p>So given the fact that he had had this bad experience in the past, we had to
                    approach him in a very delicate fashion. We asked a friend of his to approach
                    him first and ask him if he would be interested in a 30-day grant to the United
                    States, a leader grant, as it was known in those days. The friend came back to
                    us and said yes, that Mendez Montenegro would be interested in discussing
                    it.</p>
                <p>Lic.Mendez came over to my office. In order to make sure that nothing would go
                    wrong this time, I talked to our consul general and I said, “Look, send the
                    papers over to my office and let me handle all the things over here.” He was
                    extremely cooperative and said yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>So we managed to do that. We sent Lic Mendez on the grant. He was absolutely
                    delighted with his experience, and he came back just raving about the United
                    States and how wonderful the people were to him. I was invited to his home for
                    dinner to meet other members of the family. His older brother was then the
                    leader of one of the political parties, another brother was an attorney, another
                    brother was an officer in the Guatemalan Army. One of the reasons that we were
                    interested in Julio Cesar Mendez Montenegro was because we were expecting him to
                    become the next rector of the university, and that is what he had in mind.</p>
                <p>As fate would have it, the brother, Mario, who was the leader of the Partido
                    Revolucionario, the PR party, committed suicide, and Julio Cesar had to assume
                    the leadership of the party. Not that he wanted to, because he had been out of
                    politics since his student days in the 1940s, in the revolution of 1944 in
                    Guatemala. But as you know, these parties are very personal, and so with his
                    brother dead he had to step into the breach. He ran for the presidency in 1966
                    and won instead of becoming the rector of the university. [laughter] So we had
                    done much better than we thought!</p>
                <p>As a result, there were very good relations between the embassy and the president
                    during his four years in office. I went down on an official visit to Guatemala
                    in 1966 after his election but before he became president, and he and his wife
                    invited me over to the house for tea. They were not living in their own home
                    because it was not secure enough. They were living in a friend's home surrounded
                    by guards, German shepherd dogs, machine guns and what have you, because there
                    was great fear that he might be assassinated before he took over the presidency.
                    Well, he was not, fortunately, and he managed to survive his four years in
                    office.</p>
                <p>I came back in 1969 on another visit. I was then at Brookings Institution as a
                    federal executive fellow. This was after I came back from the Philippines. I was
                    engaged in some research on Latin America, and I was doing a lot of
                    interviewing. When I came to Guatemala, one of the people I wanted to see, of
                    course, was the president. I went over to see him and we had a talk for about an
                    hour or so. He said the one thing he hoped to accomplish was to finish his term
                    in office and turn his office over to a freely-elected president to succeed him.
                    Then he was going to leave the country and go to Spain, which he did.</p>
                <p>So that is the story of Julio Cesar Mendez Montenegro. He was the last civilian
                    president in Guatemala until the current president, Vinicio Cerezo Arebald took
                    office in 1986. Lic. Mendez was back in Guatemala for President Cerezo's
                    inauguration.</p>

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1966, then, you went to Manila as cultural affairs
                        officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: Yes. I had come back to Washington briefly and was involved in an
                    inter-agency committee on Vietnam. For a couple of months I was director of the
                    Latin America book program. Then I was asked to go as cultural affairs officer
                    to Manila, and I was there from 1966 to 1968.</p>
                <p>I had not been eager to go to Manila. I would have preferred to remain in Latin
                    America. As it turned out, it was a fascinating experience and I loved the
                    people in the Philippines. I told them they were the Latin Americans of Asia. I
                    noted the Spanish influence, after all the Philippines had been under Spanish
                    rule for about 300 years. The only thing that seemed strange was that not too
                    many people spoke Spanish; they spoke English or one of he indigenous
                    languages.</p>
                <p>Again, I managed to make contact with labor union leaders and gave them some
                    grants working through our labor attach� there, and met a wide range of people
                    in the cultural and educational field and also in the political field.</p>
                <p>One of the very interesting things was that Carlos Romulo of UN and World War II
                    fame in the Philippines— he had been with General MacArthur—at that time was
                    both the president of the University of the Philippines and the Secretary of
                    Education. So as a result of my job as cultural affairs officer, I had a lot of
                    contact with General Romulo, as he liked to be called. We developed very close
                    relations with the University of the Philippines and did a lot of things with
                    them in terms of grants and seminars and held events on its campus, etc. We even
                    managed to get our ambassador there for a Fulbright seminar, something which
                    apparently had not been possible for a while because there had been some student
                    demonstrations against the American ambassador coming to the campus.</p>

                <p>DILLON: Yes, I was Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Fulbright
                    Foundation, which administered the Fulbright program. The ambassador was
                    actually the honorary chairman, but he did not wish to be involved in an active
                    way. Once in a while he would come to the meetings, but would just say,
                    “Dorothy, you carry on.”</p>
                <p>I found that the staff of the Foundation was actually in the embassy, down the
                    hall from the cultural affairs office. I found this a little bit strange,
                    because, as you know, it's a binational commission.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very unusual.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: But there were a lot of things that were strange in the Philippines
                    because the relationship at that time was extremely close, and there was very
                    little anti-US feeling in the Philippines. The people who were in control of
                    things were the people who had gone through World War II and there was this
                    feeling of camaraderie, you know, of feeling for the United States, that we had
                    fought the World War together.</p>
                <p>But I felt that the Fulbright Foundation should not be housed in the embassy and
                    I was casting about to see how we could put it in offices of its own outside of
                    the embassy. As always, we had budgetary problems. Well, the 20th anniversary of
                    the Fulbright program in the Philippines was coming up in 1968.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '67 probably, because last year was the 40th
                        anniversary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: Well, whichever it was, '67 or '68. I suggested to the Filipino
                    representatives on the board that maybe as a birthday present to the Fulbright
                    Foundation they might be able to put a little bit of money into the Foundation.
                    Up to this time it had been supported completely by US money, even though it was
                    a binational foundation. A contribution from the Philippines would enable the
                    Foundation to move into new offices and increase the grants.</p>
                <p>Well, in any case, this worked out, and so before I left in August of 1968, we
                    managed to get the staff of the Foundation out of the embassy and into offices
                    of its own. A new director came in—the old director was retiring because of
                    illness—and the new director was a former Deputy Secretary of Education in the
                    Philippines. That was, I guess, the great accomplishment of my time there, in
                    terms of the Fulbright program.</p>
                <p>A Year As a Brookings Institute Fellow</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very good. When you returned from the Philippines, you
                        spent a year at the Brookings Institute.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: Yes. When I came back to Washington, I was at Brookings for a year as a
                    federal executive fellow. I was interested in getting back to my own field,
                    Latin America, and doing some research and writing. Brookings offered me that
                    opportunity for a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you work on some special project?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>DILLON: I worked on a study of Latin-American opinion on relations between the
                    United States and Latin America. In addition to my fellowship grant from the
                    agency, I received some travel funds which enabled me to make several trips to
                    Latin America during that year. I interviewed hundreds of people, in addition to
                    studying public opinion surveys, newspaper articles, editorials, and so forth. I
                    produced a study called “The Two Americas: A Dialogue.” It is something that I
                    hope to return to now that I'm out of government and therefore freer to
                    publish.</p>
                <p>Then Gradual Ascension to Assistant Director,Latin America</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After your year at Brookings, you got back to the Latin
                        American side of USIA activities by becoming desk officer and then policy
                        officer, then deputy assistant director and, finally, assistant director for
                        Latin America for the agency.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In those various jobs, you again traveled quite
                        extensively throughout Latin America.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: Yes, I traveled several times a year. I used to take what I called
                    “bites,” take four or five countries at a time. My deputy and I divided the
                    territory. One would go to one set of countries at one time, the other would go
                    to another set. In the course of he year, at least one of us and the desk
                    officer for that particular country normally would have visited the country and
                    talked to the USIS people first-hand and had a chance to look at their
                    programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's essential, isn't it, to have face-to-face contact
                        on the problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: Oh, yes, that's very important. It's one thing to read reports, but it's
                    another thing to be on the scene and to actually see what is going on.</p>
                <p>I might say, recalling my Guatemalan days, my assistant cultural affairs officer
                    Jack Brockman, who had become director of the binational center when I was in
                    Guatemala, was a very good businessman, and he managed to put the center on its
                    feet financially. During our time in Guatemala, we put away, as I recall,
                    something like $25,000 as a nest egg to eventually build a center. Well, over
                    time, that center was eventually built.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a beautiful center now.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>DILLON: By the time I became area director, the center was built, dedicated, and
                    flourishing. It's a very lovely place. Unfortunately, it was damaged by the
                    earthquake which took place in February of 1976, but it was covered by insurance
                    and eventually was restored. In any case, there was a happy ending to the
                    binational center in Guatemala, IGA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the Latin American office in these various
                        jobs from 1970 to 1976.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you tell us something about the role of USIA during
                        those years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: Perhaps I might begin with the policy officer job, because that job, as
                    you know, since you were in it eventually, entailed attendance at inter-agency
                    meetings over at the Department of State, and participation in the comments on
                    and revisions of the CASPs, the Country Action Strategic Papers that each
                    embassy had to produce. They were sent to Washington for comment at the
                    inter-agency level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were the State Department documents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: Everybody participated in them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. Inter-agency.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: USIA participated, CIA, AID, and the economic and political sections, all
                    the sections of the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were talking about the CASP. Also, as policy officer,
                        you got very much involved in the country plans for USIA at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Comments on Value and Nature of Country Plans</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>DILLON: Yes, indeed. I must say that I was not always in sympathy with the
                    efforts of the agency in Washington to put so much paperwork on the USIA folks
                    abroad. I tried, as much as possible, to cut down on the country plans, to make
                    them shorter. I felt that there was just no reason for producing very lengthy
                    documents, which in many cases became figments of the imagination because you
                    were planning a year or so ahead on what you thought you might do. As we all
                    know from our experience in the field, you very frequently have to take
                    advantage of so-called targets of opportunity, and you may not always do exactly
                    what you have planned ahead to do because something comes along that you find is
                    extremely useful from a program point of view, and you may decide that you want
                    to do that.</p>
                <p>So far as the country plans are concerned, as I say, my own feeling was that the
                    shorter they were, the better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you do need some kind of documented planning.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: You need some kind of a focus so that the people at each post get
                    together to work out what they plan to do. What are they trying to accomplish in
                    that particular country? What do they want to emphasize? Where are the problems
                    in relations between the United States and that country? Where are the
                    misunderstandings? Do the people lack knowledge of the United States or of US
                    policy or do they lack understanding of US policy? Therefore, it seems to me
                    that you do want to plan in terms of those areas, rather than just scattering
                    your shot and just doing everything and anything that might come into your
                    mind.</p>
                <p>As I say, my feeling is simply that these should not be long, detailed document,
                    but rather short documents which would lay down in general terms what you plan
                    to do over the next year or so.</p>
                <p>Explaining Watergate Abroad</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were area director during the time of the Nixon
                        troubles, Watergate and so forth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: Yes, indeed. I must say I sympathized with our people in the field at
                    that time having to explain this to foreign audiences. One amusing side of that
                    problem was that in our area, in Latin America—and this happened in other areas,
                    too, I think, in Europe and elsewhere, but I certainly know it happened in Latin
                    America—the people sometimes wondered what we were making all the fuss about
                    because, given what they were used to in their political systems, they didn't
                    quite see why we were getting so excited about what Nixon had done. So there was
                    a great deal of explaining to do.</p>
                <p>VOA's Performance During Watergate</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>One thing that I must say about this period, at least as I experienced it,, was
                    that the Voice of America was able to report what was going on. They were not
                    hindered from doing this by the director of the agency. They were told, “Don't
                    report just rumors and so forth.” But “When you've got your facts straight,
                    report the bad along with the good.” And so as far as I was aware, during this
                    troubled period the agency functioned as it was supposed to function. In terms
                    of the Voice of America, one of its functions is to report the news straight
                    about the United States and other things. I must say that during that period,
                    VOA was permitted to do that.</p>
                <p>VOA's Relevancy in Latin America</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As area director at that time, what was your relationship
                        with the Voice? Was there a close relationship?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: Well, yes, because one of the things that I hoped to do as area director
                    was to try to revitalize the Voice of America programs in Latin America.
                    Short-wave radio is not that vital to Latin America. You look upon it as
                    something that you can fall back on in a crisis. If you get into a situation in
                    a country where all the media come under the control, let us say, of the
                    government, and the USIS program is hampered, there remains, then, the Voice of
                    America, which can be picked up directly by the people in that country for the
                    news and for explanations of US policy. So from that point of view, it's
                    important. But on a day-to-day basis in Latin America, we just have so many
                    other opportunities and we have so many opportunities to be on the air directly
                    in these countries by providing programs to the radio stations, in addition, of
                    course, to television, motion pictures and the press and everything else, that
                    short-wave broadcasting to Latin America does not play the same role in this
                    area as it does, say, in Eastern Europe, where it is a much more vital means of
                    communication due to all the restrictions put on the rest of our programming in
                    those countries.</p>
                <p>Now, in the case of Cuba, of course, where the situation would be somewhat
                    comparable to Eastern Europe in terms of restrictions on what we can do, since
                    we don't have full diplomatic relations, VOA is more important. On the other
                    hand, Cuba being so close to the US, people in Havana can easily get radio and
                    television programs from the United States, from Florida and other places.</p>
                <p>We did have, for about 13 years, a special program for Cuba called “Cita Con
                    Cuba.” It was started during the Kennedy Administration and was given up during
                    the Nixon Administration, as I recall, shortly after I came in as area director.
                    The people in the Voice felt that it really wasn't accomplishing anything at
                    that point, and that the regular Voice o America programs were getting into
                    Cuba, and therefore they didn't quite see the need to continue this program.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>I mention it because several years ago, various groups in this country decided
                    that what Cuba needed was a special radio program for Cuba. This was Radio
                    Marti, which at first, those who supported the idea of this program wanted to
                    set up as a medium-wave program outside of the United States Information Agency.
                    Well, to make a long story short, because of opposition from some radio
                    broadcasters in this country who were worried about their own radio programs
                    being interfered with if Castro carried out his threat to jam this new radio
                    program, and for other reasons, it eventually was set up within the United
                    States Information Agency and is functioning there today. I really don't know
                    anything much about it directly at this point, since I'm no longer in the
                    agency, but I read about it in the USIA newsletter and so forth. It's going on.
                    Whether it's accomplishing anything or what it's accomplishing, of course, I
                    don't really know.</p>
                <p>Radio Marti</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After that 13 years of the “Cita Con Cuba” program, didn't
                        it appear at that time that the US and Cuba were going to normalize
                        relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: Well, there were a number of attempts, yes. There were a number of
                    attempts to come together with Cuba and to see whether or not something could be
                    worked out. Of course, as a result of the setting up of Radio Marti, the
                    agreement that we had made several years ago with Cuba on immigration simply
                    fell by the wayside because Castro was angry about the setting up of Radio
                    Marti. Just recently that agreement has been reactivated. I guess that Castro
                    and company decided that Radio Marti was not that much of a threat to them. I
                    don't know what this says about the effectiveness of Radio Marti. [laughter]</p>

                <p>Audience Data System at Posts Valuable?</p>
                <p>DILLON: It's not a terribly interesting subject, but it's vital in terms of
                    programming overseas, given the fact that our people change and play this game
                    of musical chairs so much, people moving around from one country to another.
                    During my time as area director we set up an audience data system in each of our
                    posts in Latin America whereby each of the posts were required to make a very
                    special effort—a concerted, detailed effort with the help from specialists in
                    Washington—to set up a system whereby they would have the names, addresses,
                    biographical information, etc., on a wide range of their contacts in each one of
                    the countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>I might say that this was very hard to do because all the PAOs resisted it, and I
                    can understand why. I probably would have resisted it myself if I were in their
                    position. But I think those of us who served in the field for all those years
                    prior to this know what the problem is when you come in new to a post and you
                    find a little box of cards off in the corner someplace with some names in it.
                    This is your audience data, and they're probably five or ten years old, and the
                    people have either died or moved in the meantime. So you start all over from
                    scratch. So I said to all the PAOs, “Look, I know it's going to be a chore to do
                    this, but once you leave this post and you go into another post where this has
                    been done, you're going to be thankful for it.” And we did manage to set this up
                    in all of the Latin American posts before I left office. I believe now it is
                    worldwide in the agency. I've forgotten now what they call it, some other name.
                    But in any case, it's the same idea. It's now on computers, I believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When it first started, there was some controversy about
                        whether or not we should do this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: It was a chore, you see. It was a boring chore to do it, and that was the
                    real problem for everybody, for the national employees and the Americans to make
                    out all these cards containing information on all their contacts, then to file
                    them and group them, an then to begin to use them when sending out invitations
                    and sending out publications and whatever you do in terms of your programming.
                    That was, I think, the reason for the resistance. It was simply the resistance
                    to the kind of work that was involved in setting up the system.</p>
                <p>Then, of course, the problem is that you must keep it up to date. If you don't,
                    then all the work has been in vain, because five years later, you're back at
                    square one.</p>
                <p>Diplomat in Residence at American University</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After being area director and before you retired, you
                        became diplomat-in-residence at the American University for two years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: Yes. I was planning, actually, simply to retire after my three years as
                    area director. The then- director of the agency asked me if I would like to
                    participate in the diplomat-in-residence program at Fletcher. I said, “Well, I
                    can't go to Massachusetts to do that.” My mother was still alive and she wasn't
                    well. I said, “I really can't leave Washington but I would like to do it in one
                    of the Washington universities.”</p>
                <p>So the director of personnel said to me, “Where would you like to do it? Who
                    might be interested?”</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>I had a lot of contacts at American University with the Latin American faculty
                    there, and I talked to the then-dean of the School of International Service, who
                    happened to be somebody who was interested in Latin America and had been briefly
                    in the Foreign Service as a political appointment, I think, during the Kennedy
                    years. He was delighted to have me come as the diplomat-in-residence. Among
                    other things, I handled their internship program. The university had a program
                    for students coming from colleges out of the Washington area for a semester to
                    study US foreign policy, US economic policy, etc. Part of this program involved
                    two or three days each week of internship in a public or private agency in
                    Washington where they would get first-hand work experience as part of their
                    academic credit. So I was involved in that.</p>
                <p>Then I was involved in advising students in the School of International Service
                    with respect to Foreign Service careers. I also participated in courses, a
                    variety of courses, and also gave a course on Latin America one of the
                    semesters. At the end of my first year, the dean asked if I could stay for a
                    second year, and the then-director of our agency, John Reinhardt, agreed for me
                    to stay on for a second year at American University. Then I retired after that
                    from the agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you began your career in academia, and I can't say that
                        you ended your career in academia, but you went back to it for a while,
                        because your career hadn't ended yet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: As a result of my two years as diplomat-in- residence, I found out that
                    the six universities in the District of Columbia are involved in a consortium.
                    Some of the Latin American faculty in the universities had managed to get a
                    grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to set up a Center of Latin
                    American Studies. They asked me if I would be interested in becoming director of
                    the center when I would retire from the government. So that's how I became
                    Director of the Washington Center for Latin American Studies, a center which
                    represented the Latin American programs of the six universities in the
                    consortium of universities.</p>
                <p>Member of Foreign Service Grievance Board</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You also, since 1984, have been a member of the Foreign
                        Service Grievance Board (FSGB).</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: Yes. I had resigned from the Center in 1982. I was tired of raising money
                    and in January 1987 I was appointed by the Secretary of State to the FSGB for
                    two years, subject to renewal. I'm now towards the end of my second term. You
                    have to be approved by the heads of all the agencies and by the unions. That
                    means the Foreign Service Association and AFGE. Plus, the Secretary of State,
                    the Director of USIA, the Director of AID, the Secretary of Commerce and the
                    Secretary of Agriculture. In other words, any place where there's Foreign
                    Service officers.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>It has been a very interesting experience. It's much more common to grieve these
                    days than it used to be, and every once in a while you feel that you're able to
                    do something positive for somebody who really was treated rather badly by
                    his/her particular agency. You can redress some wrongs.</p>
                <p>Current Status of Women Officers in USIA</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On another subject, you've been active in women's affairs
                        during your career with USIA. I wondered if you would care to comment on how
                        things have changed, as I assume they have somewhat, with respect to women
                        officers in USIA, for example.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: In general, they've changed somewhat for the better, but not as much as
                    you might think in the last 20 years or so. Obviously, we have more women
                    officers, for example, in the Foreign Service, and we also have a few more women
                    at the senior level. But I recall a couple of years ago, I think it was about a
                    year or two after the Foreign Service Act of 1980 was passed, some of the women
                    who were still in the foreign affairs agencies and active in the Women's Action
                    Organization (which was founded in the early 1970s and in which I was vice
                    president for USIA sometime in the early 1970s) made an attempt to call
                    attention to the continued discrimination against women in the foreign affairs
                    agencies.</p>
                <p>They testified before a Congressional subcommittee on how the Foreign Service Act
                    of 1980 was being implemented. One of the things the Act said was that the
                    Foreign Service should represent, to a greater extent than it had in the past,
                    the American population, which would mean more women, more minority men and
                    women, etc. The testimony was directed to how much had been accomplished since
                    the Act had been passed. These women said that really not much had been
                    accomplished. They complained that although there were a few more women in
                    senior grades in these agencies, these women were not being given appointments
                    commensurate with their personal grade. I still hear complaints like that
                    today.</p>
                <p>In my own case, of course, I told you that one of my reasons for joining the
                    Foreign Service at the time I did in 1960 was to get out of a particular
                    situation where I had no legal protection at that time. I mean, anybody could
                    discriminate against anybody, against women, blacks, Hispanics, etc. There was
                    no law to prevent it; there was no civil rights legislation, you see. When I
                    transferred to the Foreign Service, I then found, as time went on, I never got
                    promotions. And also in my Foreign Service career, I was recommended for certain
                    positions and again turned down because I was a woman. I said, “Well, I thought
                    this was illegal now.” [laughter]</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Anyhow, when I was in the Philippines in 1968, I decided that since I had been in
                    a Class I job (old class II, now Class Seven Foreign Service) for two years and
                    still had not received any promotion, I would file a grievance with USIA before
                    I returned from the Philippines. This was in 1968. I was the first woman in a
                    foreign affairs agency to file such a grievance on the basis of gender
                    discrimination. My complaint never received publicity because I had such a clear
                    case that the agency didn't have a leg to stand on.</p>
                <p>When I came back to Washington, I discovered that the grievance officer who
                    investigated my case not only had found all the things that I knew about, but
                    had found others I didn't know anything about. He said, “It is absolutely clear
                    that your career has been hurt in the agency by discrimination.”</p>
                <p>One of the things that I found very disturbing was that the USIA inspector to
                    whom I had mentioned my problems when I was in Manila, wrote an evaluation of
                    me—at that time inspectors wrote individual evaluations— which was very
                    flattering in terms of my work in the Philippines, but then went on to say, “She
                    has complained about discrimination against her as a woman, and therefore I
                    recommend that she not be promoted.” (I wasn't). [laughter] And of course, I
                    would never have known anything about this except that the grievance officer had
                    found it in my file. He said, “We have now taken it out and destroyed it. He
                    never should have done this.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And fortunately, inspectors don't make those individual
                        evaluations anymore.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: No, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Based on a one-week visit or five days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: Exactly. I've done two inspections, so I know how little you can learn
                    about people in a week or two. So anyhow, that was taken out of my file. Then
                    there was something put in my file to the effect that as a result of an agency
                    investigation, yes, indeed, my career had been harmed by discrimination over
                    many years. And as a result, the next time around, I finally got a promotion,
                    after 13 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I gather you feel we have a long way to go, but there has
                        been some improvement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: Yes. During my three years as area director (I was the first woman to
                    head a geographical area in USIA), I tried to help all the groups that I felt
                    had been discriminated against—blacks, Hispanics and women. I brought up from
                    something like 5% to 20% or more the number of women officers that we had in
                    Latin America. We only had one woman PAO who was actually appointed by my
                    predecessor.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that Barbara Hutchison?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: Yes. I tried very hard to find women candidates, but one of the problems
                    was that the women were so far behind in terms of their grades that it was very
                    difficult to find anybody to fill a PAO position. They were all too junior. I
                    did much better on blacks and Hispanics. I had, I think, three black PAOs and
                    three Hispanic PAOs during my time as area director.</p>
                <p>My colleague at that time, George Haley, who was the assistant director in charge
                    of equal employment in the agency—he himself is a black, Alexander Haley's
                    brother—.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The author of Roots.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: That's right. George said to me, “You know, the problem in USIA is not
                    discrimination against blacks; the problem is discrimination against women.”</p>
                <p>Advisability of Sending Groups of Social ScienceTeachers to US—Especially from
                    Secondary Schools</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Interesting. Finally, before we close, is there anything
                        that we haven't covered that perhaps you want to comment on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DILLON: There's one program that I was involved in in Guatemala which I would
                    like to emphasize because it dealt with a group of people very much neglected in
                    recent years. When I came to Guatemala a group of 50 social science teachers at
                    the secondary level had just returned from two months in the States. They had
                    been accompanied by two embassy officers, one of the political officers and one
                    of the assistant cultural affairs officers, the one in charge of exchanges. I
                    think it was one of the most successful programs that I have ever seen. I can
                    say this because I was not involved in sending the group but I worked with the
                    group after they came back. Because of their experience, for the next three
                    years we didn't have to follow them up; they followed us. They visited us
                    frequently and went out in groups of twos and threes to give talks all over the
                    country about their experiences in the United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>At that time, we had a special program for high schools outside of Guatemala City
                    because they were very much neglected. One of the senior Guatemalans on my staff
                    had been a former high school teacher, so he was in charge of this program. The
                    American students used to go out and talk to the students, the American officers
                    went out, and these Guatemalans and others, but particularly this group who had
                    been to the United States. They went out to all these schools for nothing. They
                    got only their expenses, their travel, and, if they stayed overnight, their room
                    and board, but that was all. They talked in schools, in village squares, etc.
                    The program was a tremendous success in terms of the participants teaching.
                    Since textbooks are very poor or nonexistent, the teacher is extremely important
                    in influencing the attitudes of students, particularly at the high school level,
                    where these attitudes are being formed.</p>
                <p>I said at that time, if I had enough money I would send every social science
                    secondary school teacher in Guatemala on such a program. Needless to say, I
                    didn't have the money, but I notice now that under this big exchange program
                    that the agency now has as a result of the recommendation of the Kissinger
                    Report on Central America, that some secondary teachers are being included in
                    that—not many, but some. I wish that people involved in the educational exchange
                    program would realize what can be accomplished if you get at this particular
                    group of teachers at the secondary school level. It really can have a very
                    significant effect, not only on their methods of teaching and how well they may
                    teach, but in forming the attitudes of students.</p>
