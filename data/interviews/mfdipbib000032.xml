                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, in view of your extensive—as well as
                        analytic—writings and publications on the subject of our foreign policy,
                        covering some forty years of experience as a reporter, publisher,
                        commentator, participant in the national-political forum as ambassador—with
                        particular reference to your recent book, The Twilight Struggle: Tales of
                        the Cold War 1987, it would seem appropriate to address your comments
                        specifically to our system of determining our foreign policy, and how it is
                        carried out, and by whom. For example, the congress, the executive, the
                        press.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>In view of the great disparity of views among George Ball, George Kennan, Senator
                    Fulbright, Senator Church, Senator McCarthy, Senator Jackson, liberals,
                    conservatives, neos of all kinds, and the common opinion of Wild Bill Donovan,
                    Secretary Haig and many others, that we are less secure than we were 50 years
                    ago, what comment would you have as to our system of determining foreign
                    policy?</p>
                <p>Before we get into your comments, let me also reference chapter 22, “A Hard Look
                    at the Establishment,” referring to the State Department, of course, of your
                    book, The Reds and the Blacks; and also to chapter 9, “Command,” of your book
                    Making it Through Middle Age, published by Atheneum. The previous book is
                    published by Harper and Row.</p>
                <p>ATTWOOD: What's your first question?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What comment do you have, in view of your experience both
                        in the private sector, and as an ambassador working with the State
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ATTWOOD: First of all, the incoming President should be someone who knows what he
                    wants—how he wants to conduct foreign policy. Now he may be right or he may be
                    wrong, but he's got to know because that is where the decisions are going to be
                    made. [Working] through the bureaucracy, it can be altered, sometimes for the
                    better, sometimes for the worse. But at least there is a line and people know
                    what that line is.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>For example, when Eisenhower came in—although I admired him in many ways—he
                    really didn't have too clear an idea about what he wanted. He didn't know
                    anything about Africa, very little about Asia, knew Europe during the war and
                    knew some people there, but he delegated most of it to John Foster Dulles; who
                    had very definite ideas, many of which were wrong. Such as his ideas about
                    brakemanship, and threatening the Russians when they felt already threatened.
                    And denouncing neutralism; in other words, all those who disagreed with us had
                    to be against us. But in each case you somebody took charge. In Eisenhower's
                    case it was Dulles.</p>
                <p>Kennedy knew pretty well what he wanted, too, except he started out as a
                    crusader, you recall from the inauguration speech. Then he stumbled into the Bay
                    of Pigs, because of CIA advice, which he inherited from the previous
                    administration; and that taught him a lesson. By the end of his three years, he
                    had learned a lot about the realities of this world, and that it was not all
                    black and white, and that we had to accommodate to the thoughts of others. He
                    was developing a very new kind of relationship with the Russians, with
                    Khrushchev particularly—with whom he corresponded privately. I think 49 letters
                    went back and forth between them—hand delivered letters.</p>
                <p>He became aware of the realities of the world; that the division in the world was
                    more than perhaps north-south, east-west. Yet he had to get over a lot of
                    obstruction from existing agency, from people in the State Department who had a
                    vested interest in the policy—whether or not that policy was the right one. They
                    themselves had invested time in argument and effort, and laid their careers on
                    the line for it, and for policy to change implied they had been wrong. So you're
                    always going to run into that kind of opposition.</p>
                <p>Now Reagan came in—another case—knowing what he wanted to do, based on the very
                    little that he knew about the world at large. As you recall, Salvador was
                    probably the number one problem of the first few months of the Reagan
                    administration. And Haig, as Secretary of State, with a very militant approach
                    to the world, was bound to fail because it was alienating our allies. It also
                    was not making any headway with our biggest problem, which was finding a [path]
                    with the Russians that would reduce, or reverse, the arms race before we all
                    went bankrupt. But Reagan, too, came around. And he, in effect—together with
                    Gorbachev—became the architects of the cold war.</p>
                <p>But in each case, the President has to—it seems to me—set a direction, and change
                    the direction if necessary. Then the bureaucracy will go along with him. Of
                    course, he can't get too far ahead of public opinion; he'd got to be the kind of
                    President who can persuade public opinion to go along with him. This is why a
                    good politician makes a good President.</p>
                <p>If the public goes along with him, then you don't have to worry too much about
                    the congress. The congress has its finger in the wind all the time, and they
                    know what they're hearing back home among their constituents.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, direct yourself to the congress, and how it works in
                        the area of foreign affairs. For instance, Senator Lugar—when he became
                        chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, at the beginning of the Reagan
                        administration—said he was going to have hearings on the proposition that we
                        had made worldwide commitments, and did not have the resources to carry them
                        out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ATTWOOD: Well, I think they have an important role to play. The most important, I
                    think, is to discourage wrongdoing, and illegal acts, by members of the
                    administration. Well, we've seen this in the Iran-Contra scandal, with Oliver
                    North and those people. They, also, were able to give impetus to our movement
                    towards arms control. There again, they were hearing it from their constituents,
                    that people were getting tired of the arms race; they didn't perceive the
                    Soviets as being the huge threat that they were perceived to be in the
                    '50's.</p>
                <p>So congress, by having hearings, and generating the publicity that comes from a
                    public hearing, I think have an influence on public opinion. But public opinion,
                    in our country—indeed, in all democracies and even in the Soviet Union—does have
                    a role to play. And the leadership can get too separated from the public on this
                    issue.</p>
                <p>So again I say, the congress—as being a representative of the people—can
                    articulate the views of the public before a larger audience, and get attention
                    in the press. And of course, the press can go too far in what can be a wrong
                    direction.</p>
                <p>Nicaragua is a case in point. Reagan is about to go out of office, but he has not
                    gotten Ortega to say 'uncle' yet, as he intended he would—or overthrow him. And
                    a lot of that is due to the fact that the congress just wouldn't vote the funds
                    for the Contras. They sensed their own constituents back home really didn't want
                    us to get involved in another tropical war on behalf of someone who really
                    didn't mean very much. They were never persuaded that Daniel Ortega was a
                    threat—a military threat—to the United States. Half of the American people don't
                    know—according to a Gallop poll—where Central America is. And the others can't
                    conceive of these tiny countries representing a great threat to us.</p>
                <p>So American common sense comes into play through the congress, I think.</p>
                <p>Well, there's a difference between the academics and the State Department;
                    because most regular Foreign Service officers have been out in the field—have
                    been abroad. And you really can't understand the world until you live there. As
                    a matter-of-fact, Ernest Hemingway once said that you never learn anything about
                    a country until you have to make your living in it, and then you really know
                    what it's like. At least Foreign Service officers have some mud on their boots,
                    so to speak; and they can draw on that kind of firsthand experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>When you talk about academics, I would assume you're talking about the
                    professional think-tank occupants: Rand, Hoover, and Brookings. I'm not against
                    them, but they very often talk theory; not all, because some of them have been
                    out and seen the world as it is—and not as it appears in the briefing papers. So
                    I think their role is useful, but should not be listened to exclusively. They
                    never sat up all night in a tropical setting, arguing with a bunch of Africans
                    about things that are not even known to most people over here. They've never
                    seen abject poverty. They've never seen the real problems that motivate people
                    in the world, which are not so much cold war problems as problems of hunger, and
                    poverty, and disease.</p>
                <p>This is one thing, I must say, Kennedy was the first to mention—in his
                    inauguration speech. But it has taken us since the '50's to realize that the
                    whole world is not lined up into two opposing camps; one rooting for the
                    Kremlin, and one rooting for us. That's never the way it was. And yet that myth
                    persisted longer than any other one in our diplomatic history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, to take an example of a expert—so-called—both in
                        academia and experience, you could take George Kennan. Why haven't his
                        views—which were quite well articulated, and broadcast—had any effect on
                        carrying out our foreign policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ATTWOOD: Well, his views on containment—back in the '40's—I think, had an effect
                    on the administration, and the power then; the Truman administration, Secretary
                    of State Acheson, they took his proposal almost too seriously. The containment
                    then became an end unto itself—the containment of the Soviets. Because we were
                    under the impression then—there was some evidence, not much, but some evidence
                    that they were expansionists. They were never as expansionist as we perceived
                    them to be. In other words, that a military barrier had to be constructed around
                    them.</p>
                <p>Yes, I think it's a good thing that we discouraged them from wanting . . . They
                    were acting mostly out of defensive anxiety. They were always under the
                    impression that we were going to attack them; so they went looking for more and
                    more buffer states. So that policy of containment of George Kennan's was adopted
                    wholeheartedly. Later on, he modified his views to the extent of saying we must
                    get along with the Russians; they're a great power with their own interests; we
                    can't treat them like outlaws forever. Then not so much attention was paid to
                    him, because he was not reflecting the conventional wisdom of the administration
                    then in power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With reference to your statement about forming foreign
                        policy in a democracy, what would you comment about these last 18 months of
                        the Presidential campaign? It seems quite evident that the candidates were
                        fearful of really discussing, in detail, foreign policy and alternates of
                        choices in policy—as experienced during the eight years of Reagan?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>ATTWOOD: Because foreign policy is a subject that can be talked about in clich�s,
                    but not accurately; and politicians like to use familiar clich�s as part of
                    their—what we now call 'sound bites' instead of speeches. I mean, peace through
                    strength is, of course, one of their favorites. Nobody can be against peace, and
                    nobody can be against strength; so these are just good buzz-words. A more
                    accurate slogan would have been strength through peace, I think.</p>
                <p>In other words, it's the military buildup—in part—which has made us a debtor
                    nation; and which is creating all kinds of problems for the Soviets. So we're
                    both going bankrupt because of strength. Well, it has kept the peace—one can
                    argue. I don't think it necessarily has, because I don't think either country
                    every really intended to attack the other. There's no reason. There's nothing
                    the Russians want that we have—or vice versa—that would risk another
                    conflict.</p>
                <p>[Tape interrupted and jumbled]</p>
                <p>ATTWOOD: . . . you get into anything more complicated. Do you remember the
                    problems that Carter had, with the Panama Canal? There was no logical reason for
                    us to try to hand on to the canal; it would have been sabotaged, and it would
                    have turned Central and Latin America against us. But he had one heck of a time
                    arguing the simplistic clich�s—we built it, we paid for it, it's ours, we're
                    going to keep it. Well, those are the kind of phrases that win in campaigns;
                    anything complicated doesn't.</p>
                <p>Now, Adlai Stevenson—in '56—discovered from some scientists that the atmospheric,
                    nuclear tests represented a risk to our health—the health of the whole
                    world.</p>
                <p>Well, he brought this up in the campaign. And Emmett Hughes, a friend of mine—who
                    was Eisenhower's chief speech writer—said he couldn't believe it. He said it was
                    insane; he said, of course he's right, but you certainly don't bring up a matter
                    like this in a campaign. It's complicated, it needs scientific proof—against a
                    general, who was supposed to be, and was recognized to be an expert in all of
                    this.</p>
                <p>He also called for an end to the draft. Well, these were adopted later on—the
                    nuclear test ban, and the end of the draft. But, you never bring up an issue, in
                    a campaign, that is subject to ridicule or can be put down, or this complicated.
                    Because people don't focus in on issues. They say they want to discuss issues in
                    campaigns; but basically, people just want to hear comforting, reassuring
                    slogans—preferably familiar ones. You know—peace, progress, prosperity, jobs,
                    higher living standards, America will be respected in the world. But if you get
                    involved in anything more complicated than that—as you must in foreign
                    policy—and then you're just kicking away the votes.</p>
                <p>I just finished writing a book on modern political campaigning. This is one of
                    the chief conclusions, that you just don't go beyond the clich�s if winning is
                    your object.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In view of these comments, what should the function of the
                        State Department be, in the formation and application of foreign
                        policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ATTWOOD: Well, I think the President should rely more on the State Department
                    than he does. The trouble with it—at least when I was there, and from what I've
                    observed since—is it's still infatuated with words.</p>
                <p>I'll give you an example. When the President of New Guinea, came to Washington on
                    a State visit, Kennedy wanted a briefing paper about it. So the State Department
                    produced, literally, a foot and a half of material, all about Guinea and its
                    economy, the president of New Guinea's biography. There's no way the President
                    could ever wade through this, or would.</p>
                <p>So, I could sense this—since I was an old magazine writer, and knew how to write
                    tight prose—I put it all on one page. I said, here's who he is; what motivates
                    him; these are his problems; this is probably what he's going to ask you; this
                    is our line right now—about seven or eight points that he had to keep in mind as
                    he talked to him. He's a proud man. He got treated badly by the French. He's
                    turning to us, but he's a little shy about it. That sort of thing.</p>
                <p>Well, if the State Department could learn to communicate with the President, in a
                    way that he would not feel he was dealing with a fudge factory, they could play
                    a very important role. And the Secretary of State should be the person to advise
                    him. The National Security Advisor, under Kissinger—and Bundy—got more and more
                    power; but it's not fair to the State Department. Because they have access;
                    they're 20 yards down the hall! So their views are going to prevail, and they're
                    not necessarily the correct views. And the State Department, which has the
                    experience and the information, can't get to him unless it's the Secretary of
                    State.</p>
                <p>Kennedy was one of the few President who would sometimes make a phone call to
                    some assistant secretary—or deputy assistant secretary; and say “what's going
                    on, I can't seem to find out.” See, the Secretary of State—under our system
                    now—makes it more difficult than when we were in the State Department. Whenever
                    there's any kind of a crisis, he gets on a plane and he's off and away; he's not
                    in Washington. This reduces the role of the ambassador to that of a greeter at
                    the airport, an innkeeper, and a kind of a guide.</p>
                <p>I think it's almost insulting to a man that you select as the President's
                    personal representative to a country—who is steeped in that country, lives it
                    day by day—and then at the slightest crisis nobody pays any attention to him;
                    they send either the Secretary, or the Under-Secretary, or Deputy-Secretary,
                    over there to take care of it. This has been growing more and more in recent
                    years, in the jet-age. Because you can be anywhere in the world in a few hours,
                    plus the much speedier communications.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>In the old days, they used to send dispatches by boat. People had time to mull
                    things over, and situations got diffused, you know. But today the State
                    Department can't play as close a role, because the Secretary and the President—I
                    don't think—see each other enough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Will you, therefore, comment on how the embassy should be
                        staffed, assuming that they should have more of a voice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ATTWOOD: I think they are overstaffed right now, in many parts of the world, and
                    possibly understaffed in others. I'll give you an example. In Africa—when I was
                    in Kenya—we had a PL 480 program, you know, food aid program, going to five
                    countries there. We had one agricultural attach�, and a secretary. You had to
                    travel around to find out where food was needed, what were their problems—their
                    agricultural, irrigation, fertilizing. There were very few statistics in those
                    countries. They were just achieving independence, and they couldn't understand
                    their own statistics, many of them.</p>
                <p>This one man was on the road nearly all the time—a back breaking assignment.
                    There were millions of dollars involved, in PL 480 food. Now, in Holland—the
                    Netherlands—we had five agricultural attach�s, with a whole suite of offices.
                    There was no agricultural crisis in Holland; nothing we were going to do about
                    it, or needed to do about it. What did they do all day?They'd go out and inspect
                    the fields.</p>
                <p>But the tradition in the Foreign Service, going back to the 19th century, is that
                    Europe is where the action is—Europe matters. When I came in—in the '60's—the
                    rest of the world was, you know, unexplored, virtually. Africa was a British and
                    French problem. We still had a neo-colonialist attitude towards these countries.
                    So we didn't staff them; we'd staff them with a few people, but not enough to do
                    that kind of job. Although, the administration sections were always very well
                    staffed, because of the paperwork. Paperwork, as you recall, is one of the
                    suffocating aspects of our State Department bureaucracy.</p>
                <p>Let me give you one example. The British have a system, whereby they recall a
                    consul from, say, Thailand to London. They say we want you to be in London on
                    such and such a day, and you can leave anytime you want, and here's your
                    allowance. They have an allowance for every city in the world, to London. Now
                    you can take a first class plane, you can walk, you can hitchhike, but you can't
                    go with the allowance. If you want to travel first class, you pay for it. You
                    just get there, that's all.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>Not us! Oh no. We have forms, as you know, you fill out. You depart home at such
                    and such a time, arrive embassy, arrive airport. For every hour you are in the
                    airport you are paid at a different rate than when you are out of the airport.
                    You arrive in Washington. Everything has got to be accounted for. And in those
                    days, the vouchers cost about $50 to make up—just one voucher. One man, that I
                    mentioned in one of these books, was questioned when he got back. They said he
                    got to National Airport—his mother was traveling with him. He said, “Did you
                    take a cab? Did your mother take the cab?”</p>
                <p>So finally he said, “No, I took the cab, and my mother walked and carried the
                    bags!” It just got so ridiculous. But that's just an example of the kind of
                    infatuation with paperwork that I think is more typical of our bureaucracy than
                    those I've come in contact with elsewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you remark on the educational experience base of
                        Foreign Service officers? Take the two types: those who come in their middle
                        20's, and those who come in their 30's or 40's—of which there are very few.
                        Then there are those who come in without going through this whole
                        process—landing a job either as an economic counselor, or even as an
                        ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ATTWOOD: That's a good question. I think the problem with attracting people into
                    the Foreign Service, and starting in the FS-08—or whatever the lowest level is
                    now—and inching your way up—knowing that there are a limited number of top jobs.
                    I mean, there are 140 ambassadorships, let's say; and you know that about 40
                    percent of them are going to be filled with political appointees, so you are
                    never really going to get to the top.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, you have to go through constant—every two, three, four years—constant
                    changes of location. I think when a man reaches the age of 40, say, and he has
                    executive ability, if it's recognized in private industry he'll be given an
                    opportunity to exercise it. This is not as true in the State Department, where
                    you just have to wait your turn. If a man doesn't have a chance to be an
                    executive, when he's ready, then it's bleached out of him. Then he get's to be
                    50, get's his executive job, and then he now longer has the energy or the drive
                    to really run a place.</p>
                <p>So I think the worst thing about the Department is, it doesn't reward—it
                    hesitates to jump a good man over. If you recognize talent, you should be able
                    to move him up through the ranks faster than they do. Now everybody is an FS-04,
                    and they all wait around to be FS-03, and everybody sort of moves forward in
                    these [lateral] ranks.</p>
                <p>Then you get to be an FS-01, and that is a big jump—to career minister—so you get
                    an accumulation—or you did in my day—of talented, but not extraordinarily
                    talented people. Maybe they didn't have the right connections. Maybe they had
                    one bad mark on their service record. So they're stuck there at FS-01.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>I remember we had a rule, back when I was with them, where if you were not
                    promoted within ten years, you were selected out of the Service. In other words,
                    you were fired. Well, I had a friend who was so good he got to be an
                    ambassador—or career minister—at age 40; but in those days you couldn't be
                    promoted to career ambassador until you were 50. So he was about to be selected
                    out because he hadn't been promoted. He was too good! That kind of thing has to
                    be cleaned out. Maybe they have; maybe the State Department has streamlined
                    itself.</p>
                <p>But I think they're having a hard time attracting really talented young
                    people—the ones who are willing to stick their necks out, because of this long,
                    slow treadmill that you have to go through before you can really feel that you
                    are making a difference.</p>
                <p>You asked what about people who come in at the top—so to speak—political
                    appointees, like myself. Well, I think they're are two kinds of political
                    appointees. There are those who are friends of the President—gave big
                    contributions to the party, and are getting a reward; it's okay if you send them
                    to Luxembourg, I suppose—it can't do any harm. But, it's unfair to the regular
                    Foreign Service officers. So those—I think they can be dispensed with; I don't
                    think ambassadorships should be considered as a reward.</p>
                <p>I think if you find somebody on the outside who has qualifications for this type
                    of work—with language qualifications, who has lived in a country, who's
                    demonstrated an interest and knowledge about it, then you have a political
                    appointee. Under Kennedy, a lot of the people who came in were not people who
                    contributed to the party. We were selected, I think, because we had been
                    around—many of us as journalists. We got to be known as non-career,
                    professionals; because we got so the professional cadre accepted us, since we
                    obviously knew our business, and we didn't try to bypass the State Department
                    and go to the White House—which a lot of them do. We played according to the
                    rules, and we could be very helpful. Because a political appointee can stick his
                    neck out; and the worst thing that can happen to him is he'll be fired, but he
                    has a job to go back to.</p>
                <p>Whereas a career Foreign Service officer who would like to stick his neck out,
                    hesitates. If the assistant secretary won't agree with him, he won't be on the
                    next promotion list. So I think an infusion of a few qualified, non-career
                    people at the top can be a very good thing. But not to clutter it up with people
                    . . . I think there was one Johnson appointee, who was sent to Sweden—or a Nixon
                    appointee. And he said, “I actually have to live there?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Along the same lines, what would you say about the quality
                        and training of the people that you had in your two embassies? Most of them
                        were career people, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ATTWOOD: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you think of their background, or experience, or
                        ability?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ATTWOOD: With a few exceptions, I'd say first-rate. I couldn't say enough. The
                    long hours they worked—and for the most part they were underpaid, considering
                    what they do. They could have made more in private industry. Very dedicated. As
                    they grew older, they became a little sclerotic. McCarthyism hurt a lot of them
                    in the 50's—scared them. A lot of them sort of ran scared, and didn't dare to
                    voice their opinions. But I think we're over that now.</p>
                <p>On the whole—the younger ones especially—I found to be dedicated, loyal, you name
                    it; worked long hours, didn't complain. And we were in a hardship post. I very
                    seldom had anybody working with me who I didn't have a lot of respect for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the judgement? You had a division in your book,
                        about those who are rational, and pragmatic—as opposed to those who are
                        emotional, and ideologist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ATTWOOD: Well, that runs right through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Among your officers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ATTWOOD: Again, I think the ambassador has a role to play, because a lot of them
                    will react according to how you feel yourself. I'll give you an example. When I
                    got to Guinea, the established policy—back in the Bureau of African Affairs, or
                    the Bureau of European Affairs—was that Guinea was a French problem. The French
                    had dealt with it. The French had pulled out—ostracized it—and the Soviet block
                    had moved in. Those were the days of the cold war. We were all cold warriors in
                    those days—it was the enemy, and we were there to fight it.</p>
                <p>Well, the attitude of the State Department was to not do a thing—they are beyond
                    the pale; the French don't want us to anything; therefore we take our cue from
                    the French. Deputy Secretary Summers said, “Well, why let this place turn into
                    an African Cuba?” That was our attitude, though it actually wouldn't have
                    because they were so inefficient that it would have been a disaster. It would
                    have cost the Russians as much as Castro was costing them.</p>
                <p>Anyway, our idea was to see what we could do, and find out if these people are
                    neutralists, and bring them around, give them a little aid, and show them that
                    what we do is more practical than what the Russians do. Never mind what the
                    French think.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Well, that created a problem. The embassy was divided. We had one officer who
                    felt we should just let them go down the spout; but the others gradually got to
                    feel that it was more fun to make an effort, and went along with my views. Then
                    I got the President's backing on it. And of course, if you've got the
                    President's backing, then you find that the Assistant Secretaries of State go
                    along, too!</p>
                <p>But that's the only time I used my access to the White House, in order to try to
                    change a policy. He was in favor of making an effort there; and not just kissing
                    it off. All ambassadors have that privilege—of going to the President. It's not
                    one that you should abuse, but now and then, when everything comes to a dead
                    stop—and you remember what it was like in AID. If the bureaucrats didn't want
                    something to happen, it didn't happen. Months went by—ships weren't loaded,
                    ships weren't available. Well, one call from the White House and all of a sudden
                    everything got moving. So sometimes you really had to do something like
                    that.</p>
                <p>But there's where it's an advantage to be a non-career appointee.</p>
                <p>[Tape interrupted]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you comment on the press, and foreign relations, and
                        foreign policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ATTWOOD: I could start out by saying that I think when people are brought into
                    the Foreign Service, from the outside—and I don't say this because I happen to
                    have been a journalist all my life—by and large, people who have been in
                    journalism make better diplomats, certainly, than people, say, who have come out
                    of the law.</p>
                <p>One reason is that the journalist is trained to observe; to report accurately on
                    a situation; to win over the confidence of people who maybe don't want to talk;
                    to separate fact from fancy—good journalists; and to get some mud on his
                    boots—to get out in the back country and not just exchange rumors with other
                    diplomats. I've seen this happen time and again. I think one of the best things
                    about Kennedy's impact on the State Department was in the number of people who
                    came out of journalism, and brought into the State Department. It's a long list:
                    Carl Rowen, John Barlowe, Martin, and on. It's not just a few of us; I can't
                    remember them all now. But that's one point.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>The second is that your relations with the press are—they will trust you, and
                    report accurately what you say, and hold back information which is maybe not in
                    the national interest, if they feel you are leveling with them. And my own
                    feeling—because I came out of this profession, perhaps—was that I always told
                    them, unless the information was highly classified, just what we were doing,
                    what was going on. And now and then I'd say, “That is for your information, and
                    it would be best if it wasn't published.” And 90 percent—maybe 95—accepted this.
                    Because they knew that if they violated that trust I placed in them, I wouldn't
                    see them again. And I think this is true throughout the government.</p>
                <p>The press is not your enemy, as many of them think. (end of tape)</p>
                <p>ATTWOOD: As I was saying, my policy—and I think that of most former members of
                    the press who joined the government—was that it was always better to trust them,
                    if you wanted them to write accurately, and not to distort things. If they feel
                    you are withholding information, or lying to them, they'll never forgive you.
                    And there's no reason we should lie. I always assumed that journalists were
                    patriotic Americans—as patriotic as I was. That I was in the government meant
                    that there were things that I knew that they didn't know. I went as far as I
                    could in telling them what we were doing. Now and then I'd say, “We've reached a
                    point where I could tell you more, but it shouldn't be published.”</p>
                <p>And they said, “Well, don't worry. If it's off the record, it's off the record.”
                    Now, my policy was to trust people; knowing that if they violated that trust, I
                    wouldn't talk to them again—and they knew this. So I never had any bad
                    experiences with them.</p>
                <p>On the contrary, they would be very helpful. It worked both ways. Because they
                    had information; they got around in ways that I didn't, and my embassy officers
                    didn't. And they would share information with me, from time to time. I'm not
                    saying they were acting as CIA agents, or anything like that. On the contrary, I
                    think it was a terrible mistake when the CIA actually tried to recruit
                    journalists—and they succeeded in some cases.</p>
                <p>But on the other hand, as an American who observes something, I think he has a
                    duty to tell his government about it; only because the government needs accurate
                    information.</p>
                <p>So I found that it worked both ways. A former journalist, obviously, can have a
                    much better rapport with working journalists, than can bureaucrats who are—not
                    trained—but habituated to distrust the trust, and consider them as nosey
                    intruders; they're there to get some kind of a scoop, or an expos�. Well, there
                    are those; in every profession there are bad apples. But on the whole, if you
                    tell somebody the truth, and he knows you are, you can establish a good mutual
                    relationship with trust.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the CIA. Could you comment on the advantages
                        and disadvantages of their operations on foreign policy overseas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ATTWOOD: Well, it depends on what the CIA's mission is in a country. I think they
                    are indispensable in gathering information. They have methods of obtaining
                    information that are not available to regular Foreign Service officers—use of
                    money, of course; and recruiting local nationals to obtain information. I don't
                    consider this all that bad.</p>
                <p>But I think when we are in the business of subverting, or trying to overthrow
                    governments, or waging paramilitary operations—that's where the CIA has gone
                    overboard, and should be reigned in; as Kennedy reigned them in after the Bay of
                    Pigs. After that fiasco, which was largely caused by the CIA furnishing the
                    President with false information.</p>
                <p>I was in Cuba, in '59, and I met CIA people there who main sources were members
                    of the Havana country club. Obviously, they thought that the people would rise
                    up if there was a landing at Cuba, and overthrow Castro. Well, they didn't get
                    out among the people. So, that kind of operation is very bad, I think. And they
                    should stay out of it. But in terms of analyzing intelligence, gathering it by
                    unorthodox ways . . . .</p>
                <p>Let's say, just a hypothetical case: one of our young CIA agents strikes up a
                    friendship with an attractive, young secretary of the Soviet legation or
                    something; and he obtains information through that relationship. I don't see
                    anything all that wrong about that, personally. Those are games, and tricks,
                    that are played. And if we pass on information—as we did to the Kenyan
                    government, about the identity of the new Soviet Cultural Attach� who was
                    actually a KGB man . . . It was useful to the Kenyan government to know what his
                    real job was, and we were in a position to do that. We also worked very closely
                    with the British equivalent—MI6.</p>
                <p>So on the whole, I say that they perform a useful function in countries where it
                    is our policy to support the government. I think where they sometimes run amuck,
                    is if we have a mission in a country whose government we oppose. Then they feel
                    that part of their job is seeking to overthrow it, or do what they can to
                    overthrow it. And that's been true in Central America and other places. So they
                    have to be kept on a much tighter leash than they have been—certainly in the
                    last several administrations; not all of them, but several of them. I don't
                    think their role in Indochina was a very proud one, either.</p>
                <p>I wrote an article for “Look,” in '66, called “A Few Kind Words for the CIA.” And
                    Dick Helms, who was then the director, was so amazed that he called me—caught me
                    in the shower of the Hay-Adams Hotel. He said, “No one ever says anything nice
                    about us at all. I just wanted to thank you.”</p>
                <p>[Tape interrupted]</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>ATTWOOD: . . . of nationalism is a much stronger force in the world than any isms
                    like communism, or democracy. When you have a world in which 2/3 of the people
                    are way below what we would call our poverty line, they care very little about
                    ideology, or whether they can go to the ballot box or not. They'd like to have
                    things work better so they can eat; and have clinics and hospitals they can go
                    to; and have jobs and work to do; and many a little plot of land to cultivate.
                    If they have any ideology, at all, it's nationalism; it's a feeling that—we're
                    somebody, we are not just the wretched of the earth.</p>
                <p>When I was traveling around the world with Stevenson—in 1953—he took note of
                    this. And he said what people in the world really want is rice, and respect.
                    It's not enough that we satisfy their hunger, but they've got to feel that
                    they're not considered to be nobody. But nationalism, which means having a seat
                    at the U.N., and being able to have their representative stand there in front of
                    the world, even criticize and attack the major powers, does a lot for their
                    self-esteem.</p>
                <p>Indochina, is a case in point. We thought, in Vietnam, for many years, that this
                    was a great communist threat; that the Vietnamese were the advance guard of the
                    Chinese master plan to take over Southeast Asia—and the dominoes would go down
                    like duckpins.</p>
                <p>Well, in point of fact, the Vietnamese were communists. Ho Chi Minh and his
                    associates believed in Communism, and essentially they were nationalists. In
                    fact, they turned to us in '45. They wanted us to help them against French
                    colonialism; but instead of that, we took the place of the French colonials. And
                    as soon as the war was over—with us—they found themselves fighting the Chinese.
                    They were supposed to be—to our way of thinking—Chinese puppets. Well, of course
                    they weren't! But that betrayed a total lack of knowledge on our part, about
                    that part of the world.</p>
                <p>I think this has been true in many areas, where we worried too much about what
                    people said, because they sounded like they were echoing the communist line. And
                    in point of fact, they were just asserting their own identity. And nationalism,
                    today, remains—I think—one of the strongest 'isms,' or ideologies that
                    exists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think this goes as far back as Frank Murphy in

                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>ATTWOOD: Well, there's no question that the Chinese communists were ideologically
                    committed to Marxism. But I've always felt that if a country starts adopting
                    Marxist practices—I don't know why that should frighten us so. Because it
                    doesn't work, basically; it hasn't really worked anywhere—particularly in the
                    country where it was first tried, the Soviet Union. And Gorbachev's problems
                    stem from it. It is a proven failure, and yet we've been obsessed by it, as
                    though it was the wave of the future—because they said it was.</p>
                <p>So I think if a country says they are going to be Marxist, like Mozambique—for
                    example—fine; let's not panic about it. Go ahead, try it out, see if it works.
                    Well, it doesn't work. And one thing that people who are in power want, above
                    all else, is to stay in power; just as those who are out of power, want to get
                    in power. This is the real motivation in all these countries.</p>
                <p>Whether it be [Samora Machel] in Mozambique, or [Sekou Toure] in Guinea, or the
                    Guineans who threw out [Toure]—what they want is to retain power. And if they
                    can't do anything about the standard of living of their people, they're going to
                    be eliminated. And if Marxism isn't going to provide that, then they'll try
                    something else.</p>
                <p>You see this over and over in the world; even the Ethiopians are changing.
                    Mozambicans have, the Angolans are changing. They've decided that Marxism
                    [ideology is] bankrupt. And the Soviets themselves! The Chinese. These are the
                    twin cathedrals of Marxism, and they are now looking for ways to modify without
                    appearing to have rejected 70 years of lip-service to Marxist-Leninism. So there
                    again, I think we've been overly sensitive and overly frightened by these words
                    Marxist, Leninism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: May I approach this from another view? And quote, in
                        effect, what many people in foreign policy have said; that—and I'm using
                        your words from your latest book. “Our core concern must always be the
                        United States national interest, which is not served by meddling in every

                <p>Now President Kennedy said this nine months after his inauguration, in effect, in

                    wasn't American University.</p>
                <p>ATTWOOD: [In] June of '63.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ATTWOOD: Yes, that was one of the best speeches he made during his entire
                    Presidency. That's the one that Khrushchev was so impressed by; and it led to
                    the limited test-ban treaty.</p>

                    why we were more appealing to people when the Russians wanted to impose their
                    system on countries. If we could say we don't care about what government—what
                    form, or economic system you choose; we're a diverse world. You have your
                    cultural, economic, and social traditions that are difference; let's make it
                    safe for diversity. Let's determine to live in peace, and not fight over these
                    things.</p>
                <p>Well, that appealed; it had a worldwide, favorable response—unlike Wilson who
                    said, “Let's make the world safe for democracy.” Well, you can't, because most
                    people don't know much about democracy. In a lot of countries democracy simply
                    doesn't work. And the Russians got into trouble when they tried to say they had
                    all the answers, and the answers were all here in Marx and Lenin. It just wasn't
                    true, of Africa—for one thing. So people resented it.</p>
                <p>But diversity—the choice of that word was brilliant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you relate that to, say, President Carter's
                        position of freedom of the individual, human rights, and our relations with
                        other countries—on the basis of their compliance with the general
                        principals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ATTWOOD: I think that Carter put too much emphasis on it, in the sense that human
                    rights is something we should tell the world—and individual countries we deal
                    with—are important to us as Americans. But to make this the sine qua non—if you
                    don't have human rights, we're not going to have . . . I don't say we have to
                    respond with hostility, but perhaps with indifference.</p>
                <p>Indifference is something we don't use enough; indifference can be very affective
                    with obstreperous children, too. They expect you to get mad, and some of these
                    pestiferous small countries, who delight in insulting us . . . I discovered at
                    the UN, why not? Let them go ahead. They're getting off some steam, and then
                    afterwards they feel much better. They'd come up to me sometimes—I got it off my
                    chest, you know. Now let's have a drink together. I hope you don't take it too
                    seriously.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>But no, we were inclined, for many years, to take everything that was said there
                    at face value; that they really didn't like us because they made these speeches.
                    I've never run into—never is not quite right—but I've almost never run into any
                    anti-Americanism; and yet there's been a feeling in this country for years, and
                    years, that we are disliked in the world—the novel The Ugly American.</p>
                <p>I don't think we're disliked; I think our policy is sometimes deplored by our
                    friends. There are cases where we interfered militarily. But even today—even the
                    Vietnamese, who we bombed to smithereens—they don't dislike us, they are trying
                    to reestablish relations with us. The one thing that nations and people don't
                    forgive of others are humiliation. You can have wars, and you can make up and be
                    friends—as we found out after World War II, with the Germans and Japanese—but
                    humiliating people is something else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you address yourself to the policy, as well as the
                        effectiveness, of our foreign aid program—on a worldwide basis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ATTWOOD: I think that the best foreign aid—from my experience—because it's less
                    suspect, is often multinational. But I think that we should have something—we,
                    the United States—ought to have some program going in every country where there
                    is endemic poverty, or where there's a real need and people are suffering. It
                    doesn't have to be a big program.</p>
                <p>I think one of the mistakes we made early on came out of the Marshall Plan, which
                    was a good thing. The Marshall Plan, I think, saved Western Europe from what
                    could have been an internal communist takeover; and it was a success. But we
                    adapted that Marshall Plan to other countries, where the economies were not
                    ready for the kind of massive aid that was involved in Europe; where small
                    projects were far more effective.</p>
                <p>I would see the Russians coming in with . . . Well, they came in to Guinea and
                    they built a gigantic printing plant, a huge radio terminal, a large hotel,
                    sports stadium, technical high schools, universities—for a country where there
                    simply wasn't any need for this kind of thing. These were grandiose projects. We
                    helped build a dam in Ghana, under Kennedy.</p>
                <p>In fact, he talked to me about it once. I said now that we're committed to it,
                    we've got to do it, because welshing on it doesn't look so good. But in
                    retrospect, I think we should have—as we welshed out on the Aswan Dam, in Egypt;
                    which I think was the correct decision, because I've been back to Egypt, and
                    I've visited that dam, and it was a disaster.</p>
                <p>These huge projects were demanded by the leaders of these new countries, but it's
                    not what they needed. And this is where I felt we did know best.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>In fact, in Kenya once I was interviewed by one of the local papers—”The Daily
                    Nation.” The headline was, “U.S. envoy admits strings to aid.” I did, I said
                    that. I said, “Sure, there's strings to aid. It's the U.S. taxpayers' money.
                    We're not going to see it dissipated on projects that aren't going to be of any
                    benefit to your economy; on Mercedes Benz for a few of your top people”—they
                    knew who I meant. “Yes, our strings are that anything that we bring into this
                    country be used for the benefit of the whole nation, and benefit of the people.”
                    It got attention, and it was true. I think we've got to be very careful. I said,
                    “I can't recommend to the American taxpayer—and I'm one of them . . . we have
                    things to do at home. We're not going to do it here, and see it all line the
                    pockets of corrupt officials.”</p>
                <p>Well, that's blunt talk, but they don't mind that. I think the small schemes. The
                    ambassadors—we had a fund of $75,000, discretionary fund, which the ambassador
                    could use. He could go to some area of the country where the people had built a
                    school, but they had no roofing. We could provide them with roofing for the
                    school, desks, books for the school. That was worth a lot more—for a few hundred
                    dollars. That $75,000 would leave a good feeling for America all over the
                    country; much more than a huge dam and aluminum smelter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the military side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ATTWOOD: I don't think the troops in most of these underdeveloped countries are
                    used for very much, other than to keep their own people in line. What do they
                    need? I think aid to the police force is probably a good thing; but military
                    aid, I think, is a waste because we're not out to provoke military
                    confrontations. I think training—if they want training—it's better to have us
                    train them than people who are adversaries.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, in Kenya—the British pretty well controlled and supplied the army;
                    but we were, I think, helpful in starting something called The National Youth
                    Course—similar to the CCC, of the days of Roosevelt. Unemployed youths, who were
                    coming into the city and committing crimes, could be drafted. We provided the
                    uniforms, and jeeps, and shovels, and all that. They could go out and do some
                    practical work—like building roads, and so forth. That's the kind of help! They
                    were in uniform, but they weren't armed.</p>
                <p>The image of the average American—of the State Department—is still too much
                    effected by the years in which they were referred to as Cookie Pushers, the
                    Striped Pants. I never wore striped pants since I was married, 37 years ago, and
                    I rented them! I never pushed a cookie across a plate!</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Anyway, there's still that feeling that the State Department are elitist, and
                    snobbish. If the only ones you got to know—especially some of the young
                    officers, the ones that I knew who are now senior officers—they'd feel quite
                    differently about it. And they have not been doing a very good job. They have no
                    constituency—the State Department. There's nobody rooting for them up on the
                    Hill. There aren't enough of them to be a constituency.</p>
                <p>So they're starved for funds, in many ways. I had $5,000 at my disposal for a
                    year's entertainment. So I could not afford to give a 4th of July party. And
                    nobody could believe it. The French, and the Italian, and the Belgium, and the
                    Russians—everybody had a party; and I couldn't. I'd have my fellow ambassadors
                    in and give them a drink. But we didn't have the money.</p>
                <p>The other thing is, when they go up to the Hill, which is where the purse strings
                    are—and you know this is just as true of AID as it is of the State
                    Department—they lacked people who'd go up there and say, “These congressmen and
                    senators are not my enemies, but they basically want to get reelected. If I can
                    give them something so they can go back to their constituents and say they voted
                    for something that's going to help me,” they'll vote. But they'd go up there,
                    and they'd justify this on strategic grounds, and this is not going to sell back
                    in Russell, Kansas. So they get the cold shoulder.</p>
                <p>I tried to tell this to President Johnson once, but President Johnson was a very
                    difficult man to talk to. I have a picture, where my mouth is open and his is
                    closed. Bill Morris said, “It's the first picture I've ever taken of President
                    Johnson where he's listening to anybody, because he always had all the
                    answers.”</p>
                <p>I said, “I don't think people are against foreign aid in this country.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Oh, yes they are.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Wait a minute, Mr. President.” I was leaving the government so I could
                    interrupt him. “They're compassionate people. My wife worked in a hospital in
                    Africa, and they had no incubator. We sent a letter back to our hometown paper,
                    and they raised $3,000 and sent us an incubator. My fathers church, on Long
                    Island, sent us a generator for lights in a hospital, in Kenya. But they want to
                    know where the money's going. It's not true.”</p>
                <p>These were always presented on the Hill—these programs—as being long-term, of
                    strategic importance, rather than getting them down to the human level.</p>
                <p>I remember Senator Vance Harkey came to West Africa once when I was there. And he
                    had a lot of black constituents in Gary, Indiana. Well, we got him out to this
                    little hospital. We had promised them a generator; they had no lights. And four
                    months had gone by and nothing had arrived, you know, from Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>So we got him holding a couple of little African children in his arms, surrounded
                    with all these Africans; and this he could use back in Indiana—this picture. And
                    when he heard about the generator he fired off this press release, saying, “I
                    have stood in this hospital, and seen these young black children delivered by
                    candlelight. It's an outrage. We promised them a generator, and I'm going to see
                    to it they get a generator.” By god, we got it within three weeks.</p>
                <p>But you see, his interests coincided with ours.</p>
                <p>[Tape interrupted]</p>
                <p>ATTWOOD: I think it has to start with the President. To go back to your earlier
                    question about how foreign policy is formulated. He has got to be the great
                    communicator, and he has to lay out these things. Now right now, we have Mr.
                    Gorbachev who does the job himself, really. I mean, his popularity has gone from
                    about 4, to 85, just because he's acting human and he gets out of the car and
                    shakes hands with people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What I'm getting at, Bill, is even the President
                        himself—as you pointed out, in the incident of President Kennedy not willing
                        (at that particular time) to get out of Vietnam, because there was an
                        election.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ATTWOOD: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do we [prevent] that kind of problem, as citizens of
                        this country, where we want to do the right thing in our relations with
                        other countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ATTWOOD: I said it started with the President, as a great communicator. But
                    obviously he can't do it all; he's not going to do it all because he's a
                    politician first, and has to think about the next election—which is always much
                    closer than it seems.</p>
                <p>But I think there's a chipping away. There are organizations, and groups all over
                    this country—as you know—who are constantly meeting, discussing: councils on
                    foreign relations in every city, league of women voters groups. On the whole
                    question of the arms race—and nuclear arms control—there was quite a seed change
                    in this country. A lot of it was due to individuals, in small communities,
                    getting together and talking these things out.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>We here, in this town of 18,000, about eight years ago started this group called
                    The Coalition of the Nuclear Arms Control. It was a coalition because it
                    included members of all parties. We got a membership list of 700 people, in this
                    rather conservative community; and we had an incredible list of speakers here:
                    generals, admirals, diplomats, politicians. And little by little, this was
                    translated into letters to congressmen. And they began to feel that there was a
                    grassroots desire to slow down and reverse the arms race, in the country.</p>
                <p>This was done at the local level, by local people; and it had its effect. I
                    think—on other issues—the reason this Nicaraguan exercise, which was ridiculous
                    to begin with—at least in my judgement—is sort of faded away, simply because no
                    support could be mobilized at the grassroots, for it.</p>
                <p>On the other hand—well, we have to get back to the congress. The congress has its
                    finger—the congressmen especially, more than senators—on the pulse back home;
                    because every two years they have to face the voters. When they feel the voters
                    are going to vote on a foreign policy issue, they're not going to get on the
                    wrong side of that issue. So I think, perhaps, we can't wait for somebody else
                    to do this; we've got to educate ourselves. And that means going out into the
                    schools.</p>
                <p>[Tape interrupted]</p>
                <p>ATTWOOD: This wasn't true in the '50's. People accepted whatever they were told
                    by their government. You know, “Ike knows best.” But now, perversely, one of the
                    ironical things about the loss of confidence in our government—after Watergate
                    particularly—the skepticism about what the government tells us, has turned into
                    kind of a desire, among a lot of people, to find out for themselves; not say,
                    “Well, that's what the State Department just announced.”</p>
                <p>We have two groups in Stanford: the Forum on World Affairs, and a new one called
                    the Ambassador's Round Table. I don't know why they call it that, because there
                    are only two ambassadors on it. But they have meetings every week or two, and
                    they have speakers come, and question and answer periods, and discussion. And
                    they're very, very well attended—far better attended than they would have been
                    20 or 25 years ago. People now feel that they need to get to the facts; they
                    don't swallow everything they're being told. And I think that's a healthy kind
                    of skepticism that's developed.</p>
                <p>An ambassador can still make a difference, if he's willing to express himself
                    forcefully, and isn't too worried about antagonizing people who could harm his
                    career. This means speaking up to the Secretary of State, the President,
                    whatever. Now how many of our chiefs of mission are conditioned to do this, I
                    don't know. In any big company how many vice-presidents are willing to stand up
                    before the board of directors and say a decision is all wrong? It takes a
                    special kind of individual; but when you find these people . . .</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's if they even let the vice-president come to the
                        board meeting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ATTWOOD: If you could get in there! An ambassador has more power than he thinks;
                    because although you must work through the State Department channel, you are
                    still the President's representative. You still have access to the White House,
                    legitimately, if you want to use it. Of course, it helps to know the
                    President.</p>
                <p>I think that's one of the most important things; President's should know the
                    people they appoint as ambassadors. They should make an effort to spend 10 or 15
                    minutes with them before they leave. This used to be done, though sometimes they
                    did it in bunches. They'd have seven come in, and that's no good. But they
                    should take a little time. After all, this man has the flag on his car. The
                    Secretary of State can come to the country, but he doesn't sit in the place of
                    honor; the ambassador is the alter-ego of the President. So the President should
                    be able to call him by his first name, and at least know the guy and remember
                    his face. When he gets a report back, which may be controversial, it wouldn't be
                    just another faceless bureaucrat.</p>
                <p>The other thing is, I think we move people around too much. I think at a terrible
                    hardship post there's reason for it, but otherwise when you win the trust of
                    people it takes about two years before they really begin to understand you. And
                    then you yank them out!</p>
