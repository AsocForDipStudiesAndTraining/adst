                <p>AMBASSADOR JOSEPH B. GILDENHORN</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: May 13, 1993</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Start from the beginning: give me an idea of your
                        background, where you grew up, something about your family</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: Actually, I'm a rarity: I'm a native Washingtonian. I was born in
                    Washington, actually went through public schools in Washington, high school at
                    Woodrow Wilson. I then went to the University of Maryland where I received a
                    B.S. degree in Business Administration, and then to Yale Law School where I
                    received my LL.D. degree. After graduating from Yale Law School, I went into the
                    Army for two years, serving in Georgia and in Germany, in a place called
                    Freiburg, outside of Frankfurt. I then came back to Washington, practiced with
                    the SEC for two years, and then went into my own law firm. I practiced for
                    twenty-five years or so, doing mostly corporate securities work, and a great
                    deal of real estate work. I eventually went into the real estate development
                    business where we constructed and developed many properties, mostly in
                    Washington, DC, though we have done some developments outside of Washington.
                    Some of our projects include the four Seasons Hotel, some major office buildings
                    in downtown in Washington. So that's basically a thumbnail sketch of my
                    background.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Being a Washingtonian and growing up in this atmosphere,
                        you must have been aware of the foreign affairs area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: Yes. I think my focus was more related to the Jewish world, being a
                    person who has devoted a great deal of time and effort to Jewish causes —
                    especially support for the State of Israel. I became interested in this area as
                    a young man, and I have continued in that vein. And that's basically how I got
                    to meet then-Vice President Bush. As a local and national Republican Jewish
                    leader, I served as an advisor to Vice President Bush, traveled with him to the
                    Middle East, and worked with him on these types of issues. I also was his
                    finance chairman in the District of Columbia in 1988 for Bush-Quayle, served as
                    the Chairman of the Inaugural Ball. After George Bush became President, he asked
                    me to serve as Ambassador to Switzerland.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to go back and talk about your work in the Jewish
                        community as it pertains to foreign affairs, because I think this is very
                        important. Every time I do interviews, both with career and non-career
                        people, dealing with the Middle East, the question of the 'Jewish Lobby'
                        comes up — both good, bad. Obviously, this is a crucial point in dealing
                        with the Middle East. How did you approach it — what was your impression,
                        being on the inside of this. Were you part of AIPAC [American-Israel Public
                        Affairs Committee]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: I was an active supporter although I was not a strong activist in
                    AIPAC. I was a member until the time that I became Ambassador to Switzerland. I
                    resigned, because I think while you are an Ambassador you should not be a member
                    of a lobby group. I have rejoined AIPAC and I am a member now. AIPAC is an
                    organization which promotes Israeli interests in this country. I think the
                    organization does positive work especially since Israel is an important ally of
                    the United States, and deserves support. I feel, as a Jew and as an American,
                    that this is a very important and positive organization. They have very bright
                    people on staff and very tuned in to what's going on. There are also people who
                    have been very influential with many members of Congress and members of the
                    Executive. So AIPAC has been very effective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to give a feel, if you don't mind, because I think
                        this is an important element of American foreign policy, however it comes
                        about — these seems to be quite a bit of controversy over the — I think it
                        was 1982 — Israel going into Lebanon and all the way up to Beirut. This has
                        caused a lot of divisions. How did this affect AIPAC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: Well, I can't respond for AIPAC, but I can give my own personal
                    observations. I actually went to Lebanon in the early '80s at the invitation of
                    the Israeli government. I drove along the coast of Lebanon up to the outskirts
                    of Beirut. This was after the cease-fire, when the Israelis were pulling back
                    their troops and armaments. My opinion was that there was a need to go into
                    Lebanon at that time since Israeli villages were being shelled and relations
                    became very strained. The Israelis feel strongly that if you are attacked, you
                    have to react. I am of the opinion that they went much too far, that they should
                    have stopped at the Litani River. Going to the outskirts of Beirut had a very
                    adverse affect, especially with respect to world opinion. I spent a couple of
                    days in Lebanon, and found it quite interesting. I spent a whole afternoon in
                    Sidon, and I remember the people at that time were very happy to have the
                    Israelis there because they had cleared out the PLO. The PLO had taken over the
                    southern part of Lebanon and had formed their own government within the borders
                    of Lebanon, and the Lebanese really felt they were captives — if that's the
                    right word — of the PLO. By removing the PLO, the Lebanese felt that they had
                    been freed. There was a real feeling of friendship between the Israelis and the
                    Lebanese at that time. Needless to say, that rapport changed fairly soon
                    thereafter and that's unfortunate. I think that it was necessary at that time to
                    go in, and maintain a zone of Israeli influence to protect Israeli villages and
                    citizens. At this time, Israeli troops are not presently there but there are
                    Christian groups that are pro-Israel controlling the southern part of Lebanon.
                    Hopefully, that will change if the peace process goes forward and is
                    successful.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking about George Bush as Vice President — what were
                        his interests in the Middle East when you were talking to him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: Again, our discussions dealt with Israel's position in the world,
                    Israel's position with respect to the United States, and Israel's position with
                    respect to their neighbors. I went with him to Israel in the summer of 1986. I
                    was an extended tour, as we spent about eight or nine days in Israel. We devoted
                    a lot of time meeting not only government leaders, but young people in the
                    country. We traveled all over the country, including the south and the Sinai. We
                    also went up to the Golan Heights, and I think that then Vice President Bush got
                    a pretty good idea as to the natural boundaries of Israel and some of the
                    security problems facing Israel. I think he got a much better feel for the
                    concerns of Israeli people and their needs. It was a very positive trip. I
                    remember one meeting in particular, when we met with young Jewish political
                    leaders of both parties, Labor and Likud. Some very candid questions were asked
                    about the US role — I don't remember specific questions but it turned into a
                    very interesting dialogue. I think that overall, the Vice President felt that
                    Israel was an important ally to our country and had to be supported. This was
                    the type of the thing that I did during the Bush administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the appointment to Switzerland come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: After George Bush became President, he asked whether I was interested
                    in becoming an Ambassador. It wasn't something I had really thought about or
                    planned for. I did indicate that I would be interested if the occasion arose. It
                    was a propitious time in my life to do something for my country and to go
                    overseas. Switzerland was thereafter designated by the President. I thought it
                    was a great opportunity and my wife and I went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk a bit about your preparation for this. Did you go
                        through the Ambassadorial Seminar and how did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: First of all, let me say that my background is in business and
                    banking. This turned out to be a very good fit in Switzerland where the banking
                    industry and business leaders have a very strong role in government and policy.
                    I felt very much at home when I arrived in Switzerland since I had business and
                    banking experience and could relate.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>The Ambassadorial Seminar was interesting and quite helpful. My only problem was
                    that because of inexperience, the substantive discussions were difficult to
                    absorb being novices. Being a new political appointee ambassador is a whole new
                    concept and work experience. So many new concepts are thrown at you in a
                    two-week grouping of seminars that it is almost overwhelming. I don't know how
                    it could be arranged, but it would be much more productive if the seminars could
                    be given about three to four months after being at post — after you had
                    on-the-job experience, and the opportunity to learn about the procedures and
                    some of the issues at post. The discussions would have had considerably more
                    meaning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Exactly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: Perhaps the seminars could be scheduled at a Chief of
                    Mission-conference, timed six to nine months after assuming post. Sessions could
                    be scheduled to discuss administrative issues and questions, with the right
                    people from State being present to answer them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It makes good sense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: It's just a thought. When I was cleaning out my desk before I came
                    home, I glanced at my notes from the Ambassadorial Seminar, and it was quite
                    interesting. I noticed that I wrote down on several occasions: 'What does this
                    mean?' This proves that it would have been much more helpful if the discussions
                    were held at a time when you had a clearer understanding about the duties of an
                    ambassador after having been at post for a period of time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any particular goals in mind before you went
                        to Switzerland? Were people here in Washington saying, Now here are our
                        problems with Switzerland and here's what we'd like to get — that sort of
                        thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>GILDENHORN: In preparation for my confirmation hearing, the desk officer who
                    prepared me described certain issues pertinent to Switzerland. For example, some
                    of the agenda items involved money laundering — drug enforcement, military
                    procurement, as well as other issues relevant at that time. It was only a
                    cursory discussion of issues. I found that until you were actually at post
                    facing substantive policy matters, the previous discussions in Washington really
                    didn't mean too much. They took on a different context after you assumed post
                    and had to deal with real issues. When I got to Switzerland, I think that the
                    first thing on my desk was a matter involving the PLO who wanted to accede to
                    the Geneva Accords as the State Palestine. This was an important issue to me,
                    because of my background in Jewish affairs. Our government was very much opposed
                    to the PLO position. But what was very interesting was that I was getting calls
                    from Jewish leaders from all over the world suggesting that both I and they
                    lobby the Swiss strenuously, to make sure that they turned down the PLO request.
                    After getting a great deal of advice from my staff in Switzerland, and based on
                    my own thinking, I felt that strenuous lobbying was a bad idea. This was because
                    the Swiss really do not take well to hard active lobbying. So I made the
                    position of the U.S. clear to the Swiss government officers and fortunately,
                    they agreed with the us. The Swiss merely sent out an information copy to the
                    members of the Geneva Accords and did not decide whether the PLO had any rights
                    to accede to the Geneva Accords. It turned out to be a good solution at that
                    time for the Swiss. As a depository nation, the Swiss were required to send out
                    a message to the members of the Geneva Accords, but they stopped short of
                    deciding whether the PLO as Palestine qualified for accession.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here is a case where, you knowing the territory or having
                        a feel for the situation, sometimes overly aggressive lobbying does not
                        help.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: I found out in Switzerland that it really is not a great idea to
                    lobby hard. I think you have to make your views known clearly, but it's
                    important, that you not aggressively tell the Swiss what they should be doing.
                    That's a “no-no”, as I found out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation on Swiss-American relations — you
                        mentioned the F-18?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>GILDENHORN: Yes, the cost of the fighter plane was very expensive and Switzerland
                    has been running a budget deficit for the past two years. Accordingly, there was
                    strong opposition expressed against the purchase of the plane, especially among
                    the Socialists who were definitely opposed. To make a long story short, the
                    Parliament did eventually approve the plane. The plane issue will become the
                    subject of a referendum to be decided by the people. The issue to be voted on is
                    whether they will purchase any fighter plane between now and the year 2000. The
                    referendum will be voted on June 6 of this year [1933]. If they turn down this
                    referendum, the Swiss will buy the plane. There is money set aside for the
                    purchase and they are all set to go. If the referendum passes which prohibits
                    the purchase of any fighter plane till the year 2000, then, of course, there
                    will be no airplane purchase. Right now, in fact, my former Defense Attach� is
                    in town and he has indicated that there are strong lobbying efforts on both
                    sides. Fortunately, almost all of the government ministers are strongly in favor
                    of the purchase and are speaking about the issue almost every night. There are a
                    lot of military people, a lot of industrialists also advocating the purchase of
                    the plane, especially since there is a 100% offset. The 2 billion dollars of
                    offsets will be put into the purchase of various Swiss goods. In addition,
                    factories within Switzerland will be created to manufacture various parts of the
                    plane as well as other items. So the Swiss really get the advantage of receiving
                    2 billion dollars from McDonnell-Douglas in the form of new business. So we'll
                    find out June 6 how the referendum vote goes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What role were you playing in this? You just left there —
                        you were there from 1989-1993.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: I believe that I was helpful in many ways. To give you an example,
                    while I was there, there was a new missile produced called the AMRAM. It is
                    really high-tech — the last word in air-to-air missiles. The Swiss heard about
                    it and basically said: Look, unless we get rights to the AMRAM, we probably do
                    not want the plane. So I immediately got back to the Department of Defense and I
                    was instrumental in persuading Secretary Garrett who was at that time Secretary
                    of the Navy, to allow the Swiss to have the missile. It is interesting that the
                    Swiss got rights to use the AMRAM before any of our NATO allies. This was the
                    type of thing that we did. I was in constant contact with McDonnell Douglas. As
                    long as we only had one American company pursuing the program, I could work
                    closely with them. We met frequently to map out a strategy to get this plane
                    purchase through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This brings up an interesting point: what happens when you
                        find a couple of companies pushing and here you are, the American
                        Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>GILDENHORN: When you have two American companies competing, you back off. You
                    really cannot play a role, because you cannot side with one against the other.
                    But once an American company is selected, you are able to assist that company to
                    achieve it's goals. Let me give you an example. Right before I left to come
                    home, there was a Swiss program out for bid for a civilian air traffic control
                    system. The U.S. company Hughes was in competition with Thompson, the French
                    company. Raytheon was also one of the bidders, but had been told their bid was
                    not acceptable. I got very much involved because the French were using a lot of
                    leverage and unfair influence on the Swiss to buy the Thompson product because
                    of their sensitive position in Europe. Because there are a lot of bilateral
                    deals between France and Switzerland which could be jeopardized, it was my
                    feeling that the French were trying to unfairly influence the Swiss. I made a
                    very strong demarche on the Swiss Minister of Transportation. I won't get into
                    some of the information I had — but we felt that the French were acting
                    improperly and we really wanted open, fair bidding. I made it very clear that
                    this was what we expected from the Swiss. So this was the type of thing I did.
                    Again, what eventually happened, was that Raytheon entered the picture again and
                    alleged that they were unfairly cut out of the competition and threatened to
                    file suit against the Swiss. The Swiss reacted in their inimitable way by
                    deciding not to make any decision and starting the competition from scratch.
                    Accordingly, nothing will probably happen for a year or so. I learned that the
                    French are very difficult businessmen and require constant monitoring.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a bit about how you have observed the
                        French operate at times?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: With respect to the F-18 airplane, right before the critical vote of
                    Parliament, which they needed the concurrence of both the upper house and the
                    lower house, we got word that the French Minister of Defense had come to
                    Switzerland to visit with the Swiss Minister of Defense. We also got word that
                    President Mitterrand was also planning to visit. We didn't know for sure what
                    they planned to talk about, but the timing of the visit happened to be very
                    close to the Parliamentary vote on the F-18. Again, we felt that there was the
                    possibility of undue influence being used, undue leverage — fortunately it
                    turned out that the Swiss chose the F-18 and withstood any type of pressure. I
                    am sure that the plane was talked about by the French at that time but to no
                    avail and to the Swiss' credit. The French really have the habit of doing
                    whatever they have to do to get a sale regardless of ethics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This has often been one of the criticisms of how the
                        United States operates — I've watched this myself. If two or more American
                        companies are bidding on something, we will, as you say, back off as far as
                        the Embassy goes because we can't get involved in this, but the French —
                        sometimes the British — will more or less come to an agreement one way or
                        the other and say, We'll go with this system or this company, and push all
                        out, whereas maybe our two or three companies cancel each other out.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>GILDENHORN: I think it's probably right that we do not choose one company over
                    another company. I did bring in the people from Hughes and asked them whether
                    they used any French suppliers in producing part of their traffic control
                    system. They said that they did include a small French company to produce
                    certain parts. I suggested that they get this small company to go to their
                    government and complain about the tactics being used. They did and I think it
                    was fairly effective in holding off the French. I mention this to give you
                    examples of some of the things I got involved with.</p>
                <p>I came to the conclusion when I got there that if I were to make a contribution,
                    it would have to be primarily in the business and trade area. Politically, I
                    found that there were certain areas in which I had a certain amount of input,
                    but generally speaking, most of the major decisions came from Washington. But as
                    far as really making a personal contribution, I felt that I could do so by
                    expanding our bilateral trade between countries, which was pretty substantial at
                    the time. When I got to Switzerland, bilateral trade amounted to 8 billion
                    dollars, split 50-50 between the Swiss and the Americans. I really spent time on
                    trade enhancement. I went to every trade show — probably 10 or 15 trade shows
                    per year. I also tried to create new trade shows, which would bring over more
                    American goods to Switzerland. By the time I left the bilateral trade was in
                    excess of 11 billion dollars, and I think I had some role in increasing those
                    figures. Trade matters was an area that I found very interesting, and where I
                    felt I could make a contribution. I even had my wife become involved in a trade
                    show promotion where she got a group of Swiss dress end users, i.e., department
                    stores and jobbers, — to come to the US to the couturier shows in New York. This
                    was a good way to get more American dresses introduced and sold in Switzerland.
                    These are some of the types of programs we were trying to create.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the products Switzerland was trying to sell to
                        the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: Other than chocolate and watches? The watch industry is very strong.
                    Actually, there is one man who did a great deal to revitalize the watch
                    industry, a gentleman by the name of Nicholas Hyack. Mr. Hyack is the creator of
                    the internationally famous Swatch watch. The Swatch is a reasonably priced watch
                    — costs about $40-50 — with a very popular, contemporary design. Indeed, the
                    Swatch watch is the marketing sensation in Europe. It has also become popular in
                    the United States. The watch industry in Switzerland is much stronger now and
                    this is all due to Mr. Hyack's creativity. But basically, pharmaceuticals,
                    machine tools — indeed anything produced where labor is not a big factor — can
                    be manufactured competitively in Switzerland. This is because labor costs are
                    extremely high in Switzerland. Because of this, machine tools are a big export
                    item. Also, the major pharmaceutical companies, such as Ciba Geigy, Hoffman
                    LaRoche and Sandoz export a large quantity of products to the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find some of the other competitors? We've
                        talked about the French. What about the Germans and the British and Italians
                        as far as competitors? Did you find yourself going head to head with their
                        ambassadors on trade items?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: I can't recall specifics. I believe that the Germans are the biggest
                    trading partner with Switzerland, but I don't recall any specific problems. The
                    Swiss are very restrictive with respect to their market access policies. For
                    example, only a small quantity of our US beef is allowed in the country and we
                    in the Embassy always tried to get more of our beef allocated for import into
                    Switzerland. We made some inroads over the years since the Swiss really like
                    American beef. It's interesting that we can export all our red wines to
                    Switzerland but not our white wines. This is because the Swiss white wines are
                    high quality and they are very protective when it come to the white wine
                    industry. But their red wines aren't particularly good so the Swiss are very
                    happy to have our Cabernet-Sauvignons and other California wines, come in. Again
                    let me say that Switzerland has a very controlled economic society with a
                    legalized cartel system and strict price controls. Access into the Swiss markets
                    was hard to achieve, but we spent a lot of time trying to open up access of our
                    products. We didn't have a large Agricultural Department at the Embassy. We had
                    one principal American officer and two FSNs who spent a great deal of time
                    interfacing with the Swiss government trying to get better access for our
                    products.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In dealing with the Swiss government, any time an
                        Ambassador goes to a country, you talk in Washington and you talk to your
                        country team, and you try to figure out where the power is, who are the
                        movers and shakers. I would think that Switzerland would be one of the most
                        difficult ones, because, as you say, the business community seems to be very
                        strong and the government seems to be somewhat amorphous. Maybe I'm wrong
                        but how did you figure out what buttons to push.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>GILDENHORN: Well, it's a small enough country to get around and you can get to
                    see almost anyone in both government and business. Actually, on my way home back
                    to Washington, I asked my driver how many miles we had on the official car and
                    he said, 150,000 miles. In Switzerland, that's a great deal of traveling within
                    a small country. I tried to cover every part of the country. I was on a
                    first-name basis with every Minister. In this regard, there are seven Ministers
                    who run the country, and I became good friends with each of them. My wife and I
                    entertained them, and they entertained us. We also spent a significant amount of
                    time in the business community with prominent bankers — I personally knew all of
                    the presidents of the major banks — Credit Suisse, Union Bank, Swiss Bank
                    Corporation. I spent substantial time going to Swiss-American business groups.
                    The Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce is one of the strongest chambers in
                    Europe with over eleven hundred members and a very aggressive program. They have
                    interesting speakers every month and they attract all of the top business people
                    in Switzerland. Through that group, I really got to know most of the important
                    business people. In addition, I visited over a hundred companies, including both
                    Swiss and American, doing business in Switzerland. I was shown around the
                    respective company and had the opportunity to meet the CEO and executives of the
                    company. That was one of my primary agenda items. What I did not want to do was
                    sit behind my desk and read cables all day. So I really tried to get out of Bern
                    and around the country. I visited about fifty educational institutions — high
                    schools, gymnasiums, universities — and really enjoyed doing that. I went to at
                    least thirty or forty newspapers throughout the country during my tenure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Swiss impression of the
                        United States? It's very easy to look at our TV and other peoples' TV and
                        talk about a society in disarray. What were they getting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: First of all, I think that the Swiss really admire and like the
                    United States. They really think highly of us. In fact, during the Gulf War,
                    there were some toasts by government and military officials which were really
                    quite emotional and almost embarrassing. I remember one Swiss General saying:
                    Thank God, the US has saved us again — the US saved us in two major wars, and
                    now they have confronted aggression once again. These were incredibly warm
                    toasts applauding the United States. With respect to the other part of the
                    question — the Swiss know a great deal about our country. First of all, thirty
                    percent of the Swiss population has been to the United States. I'm sure it is a
                    greater percentage than any country in the world. At least 300,000 Swiss
                    tourists come every year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Basically tourists?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>GILDENHORN: Yes. Out of a population of 6.8 million, 300,000 each year is a large
                    number. So the people in Switzerland know the United States first hand. I had a
                    very interesting experience in the city of Bellinzona, the capital of Ticino,
                    which is in the Italian section of Switzerland. I went up into the mountains to
                    visit a local high school. I had a session with their English-speaking students,
                    and after I gave my remarks, we had a question-and-answer period. And the first
                    question asked was about Marion Barry, the Mayor of Washington, who had just
                    been picked up for drug use. I said to myself, My Lord, how do they know! But
                    the youngsters avidly read newspapers and learn a great deal about America. CNN
                    is broadcast throughout the country, and The Economist is extensively read at
                    least by the government officials, with a whole section devoted each week to
                    American affairs. So the average Swiss is quite worldly and knows a lot about
                    what we Americans are doing. What is unfortunate is that American movies shown
                    in Switzerland usually portray violence and pornography. Most films point up our
                    social ills and never portray what is right about America. My job was to portray
                    a better, more pleasant America to the Swiss — an America in which our citizens
                    live well and a country which is disciplined and moral.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Swiss reacted to the breakup of the
                        Soviet union, the fall of the Berlin Wall and all the changes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: I think that the Swiss were as shocked as everyone that Communism
                    really fell, so quickly and peacefully. They joined with other nations in giving
                    aid to Central and Eastern European countries. Even though Switzerland is not a
                    member of the UN, they are still very active in UN affairs and remain involved
                    in every ancillary organization of the UN, but not the General Assembly. They
                    obviously felt that the demise of Communism was a very important historic
                    event.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Switzerland changed a great deal while I was there. When I first arrived in
                    August of 1989, they were an isolated country, very much into themselves. I
                    think the most important change in attitude occurred during Desert Shield and
                    Desert Storm, when Iraq invaded Kuwait. We were asked by the State Department to
                    ask Switzerland to impose sanctions on Iraq. This was a big undertaking since
                    the imposition of sanctions had never been done by Switzerland in their history,
                    because it violated its neutrality. Neutrality is almost sacrosanct in
                    Switzerland and is an important doctrine which is highly supported by the
                    people. I went to see the State Secretary Klaus Jacobi who was formerly the
                    Swiss Ambassador to the US for four years. We had really become good friends.
                    Secretary Jacobi said, We'll work it out — come back tomorrow. I went back the
                    next day and he said, Joe, we've worked it out. Every minister was on vacation
                    being it was August and each was in different parts of the world. Secretary
                    Jacobi had arranged a telephonic conference and was pleased to report to me that
                    the Ministers voted seven-to-nothing to impose sanctions on Iraq. I recall a
                    funny story that day: When I went to see Secretary Jacobi, I went to the
                    Bundeshaus and saw the Iraqi Ambassador in the lobby. I had known him, and I
                    said sarcastically that, You're making me work hard these days. When I got
                    upstairs to see Secretary Jacobi, he said, Did you see your colleague
                    downstairs? He said, He's mad at me. I said, Why. Secretary Jacobi said, the
                    Iraqi Ambassador tried to cash a check today and we bounced it — we froze all of
                    the country's funds. I said, how much was the check? He said, A million and a
                    half dollars. Switzerland was very proud of the action they had taken against
                    Iraq. The reason I bring this up, is that from that time on, they have modified
                    their neutrality to become more expansive, more accommodating to Europe and the
                    world. It was a big step for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure it was. You mentioned that they don't belong to
                        the United Nations. In a way, this must have been a God-send as Ambassador,
                        because all of our ambassadors have to run messages and say, Vote to protect
                        whales...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: We still do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in anything of that nature, through
                        the various agencies?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>GILDENHORN: As an example, when the US was urging the abrogation of the
                    Zionism-racism resolution in the U.N., we were asked to go to our various host
                    governments and ask support, which we did. We knew that the Swiss did not have a
                    vote but we knew that they have influence throughout Europe. My demarche alluded
                    to the fact that they were not members but still requested any help that they
                    could give us. Those were the types of actions and involvement. The Swiss also
                    turned down membership in the European Economic Area Agreement last December. I
                    thought that was a bad decision because membership would have given them the
                    benefits of membership in the EC but very few of the responsibilities. But the
                    people in a referendum voted against it. I think eventually they will join
                    Europe. It is just a matter of time. I have a bet that they will join sometime
                    before the year 2000.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any instructions — should we push for it, or
                        just relax and let them figure it out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: Frankly, it was my feeling that maybe with them not joining, they
                    could be the liaison between the United States and Europe. By not being a member
                    of the EC, they could be helpful to us in certain areas, especially when we
                    needed a friend who was not a member of Europe. In fact, the Swiss suggested
                    this possibility and even some of the Ministers suggested it. I honestly never
                    believed it. The Swiss are so connected to Europe, so tied in with all of the
                    community members that they're not going to jeopardize their position in any
                    way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly with the collapse of the Soviet Union,
                        there's no longer that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: Now the Swiss are even thinking about sending troops for
                    peace-keeping — blue helmets. They have sent observers to Namibia. But they
                    would never commit troops for combat. That would be a “no-no”. I think that they
                    are far from sending peace-keeping troops and will not do it for some time. But
                    at least they are thinking about it, and you're seeing a more accommodating
                    approach to the world. I think that is good. I think of Switzerland, really, as
                    a positive model — with three diverse cultures, three different languages and
                    two religions — they live together pretty well. It should have been the model
                    for the former Yugoslavia, but obviously that situation is beyond control.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Switzerland has been renowned for a long time for being

                        Did you find with the demise of the Soviet Union — did spying as an industry
                        go downhill?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: Well, I think it has changed. I think the focus has centered on more
                    economic spying than political-military spying. Most of the
                    intelligence-gathering in the country was located in Geneva where you had the UN
                    and where every country had representatives present. That is where most
                    intelligence could be gathered.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: I was told before I went over that that was always a problem and
                    beware of turf battles. But I knew Morris Abram before I went over — I didn't
                    know him well but I had met him and got along well with him. He was our
                    Ambassador to the UN and International Organizations, an excellent
                    representative of the US. His background has always been in human rights and
                    civil rights, and it was a marvelous appointment for Morris. We became very good
                    friends and we deferred to each other on matters of protocol and jurisdiction.
                    We never had a cross word. He realized that I was the bilateral Ambassador and
                    he was Ambassador to the UN, and it did not become a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How does one work in Switzerland? You have essentially a
                        small town, Bern, which is the capital, and then Geneva which is an
                        international capital, and then Zurich — where did you work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: As I mentioned earlier, I traveled over 150,000 miles throughout
                    Switzerland. Our Embassy is in Bern because that is where the capital is, where
                    the government is located, and where the Parliament meets. We conducted a great
                    deal of business with the Swiss government in Bern on a daily, weekly basis. But
                    I always felt very strongly that it was important that I travel outside the city
                    and meet the Swiss. That was one of my missions — to bring, hopefully, the best
                    of America to the Swiss. I visited every segment of Swiss society. For example,
                    I spent two days speaking to farmers in the farm belt. Farming is a very
                    sensitive matter since the industry is highly subsidized and a very protected
                    type of business. I believe that the Swiss have the highest subsidies in Europe
                    and they are not about to give up on their subsidies too readily. Many of the
                    farms have been in the families for over three to four hundred years. When the
                    government has attempted to reduce subsidies, which has to be done because of
                    the high cost, the farmers mobilize to oppose any decrease in subsidies. But I
                    thought that it was important to get these views first-hand by visiting the
                    farmers on a personal basis. It's really interesting — a dozen eggs cost six
                    dollars — it's extremely expensive. There's really nothing in Switzerland that
                    can be grown or produced efficiently, or economically. Perhaps cheese and milk —
                    because there is a great number of cows grazing throughout the country. But if
                    you get into wheat production or other grains, they just can't do it because of
                    the scarcity of land.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you under any instructions — these were major
                        American exports?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>GILDENHORN: I found that you really refrained from criticizing their agricultural
                    industry. Apparently my predecessor, Phil Winn criticized the Swiss agricultural
                    program when he first arrived. Apparently the press became very critical and
                    wrote some unkind words about Phil in their respective newspapers. I tried to
                    learn from that. If you talk about agriculture, you talk about the subject very
                    subtly, and maybe just allude to the fact that changes have to be made in the
                    future. But it's a difficult topic, not so much from the American point of view,
                    but from the Swiss government standpoint. They need to make dramatic changes in
                    their subsidy program because it's so expensive subsidizing farmers. But it's a
                    political football, a hot potato. Most countries in Europe are making a real
                    effort to cut down on subsidies, because of the high cost.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was our balance of payments fairly equal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: Almost even — we had eleven billion dollars and each country exported
                    about five and one-half billion in goods to each other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Somebody wasn't breathing down your neck on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: If anything, we were ahead because the Swiss ordered 12 MG-11s,
                    civilian airplanes. They replaced all of their Swissair older planes with new
                    McDonnell-Douglas planes. This was a big item — almost two billion dollars. So
                    when they started delivering these planes in 1991, it helped our balance — we
                    were ahead. Eleven billion dollars in total trade is considerable.</p>
                <p>I think that one of the big problems in the country is drugs. The Swiss passed a
                    money-laundering statute before any other country in Europe. The new law
                    basically puts the banks to the task of reporting large money transactions. If
                    anyone on the Bank's staff thinks that there is something suspicious, they must
                    report it. It is a good bill, good legislation, and many of the other countries
                    in Europe are starting to adopt the Swiss bill as a model. The Swiss are more
                    open in providing information about their bank accounts than most countries,
                    even though they are unfairly criticized for the secretiveness. Through our
                    mutual legal assistance treaties, the Swiss are pretty open with information and
                    very cooperative with our government. The only thing they don't do is disclose
                    information with respect to U.S. tax evaders. Tax evasion in Switzerland is not
                    criminal, it's civil; so therefore they will not extradite tax evaders which is
                    a problem. But generally speaking, the Swiss have probably done more to enact
                    laws against certain crimes than most countries — whether it be
                    money-laundering, drugs or whatever.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Their drug situation is a serious problem. It is interesting that on the French
                    side of the country, especially in the cities of Geneva and Lausanne, the
                    officials are very tough on drug use. If somebody uses drugs, he's arrested. On
                    the German side, they're very liberal. Many feel that drug addicts are people
                    who are sick and need help. What has happened is that many of the drug users
                    from places throughout Europe congregate in the cities of Zurich, Basel and
                    Bern, to mingle with other users and to receive clean needles. Many congregate
                    on a sidewalk near the Bahnhof in Zurich. They shoot-up openly which I can tell
                    you is not a pleasant sight. They get free, new needles, because the incidence
                    of AIDS is very high. There is a great deal of discussion about the possibility
                    of legalizing drugs. I remember, I gave two speeches opposing the legalization
                    of drugs, and this caused a great furor in the newspapers. One newspaper
                    commented that the U.S. Ambassador doesn't know what he is talking about, while
                    another would be supportive of my position! It's a very difficult problem.
                    Because of increased drug use, crime has increased rather dramatically. Not too
                    many crimes against people, but property crimes, i.e., burglary, etc. It is an
                    unfortunate situation. A lot of drugs come in because there is so much illegal
                    immigration. Immigration is the other big problem in the country. Many illegal
                    immigrants come in from Eastern Europe, from the South, including Sri Lanka,
                    Turkey, the former Yugoslavia, Bosnia. Unfortunately a lot of drugs come in with
                    these people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this something you took an active interest in — you

                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: I was careful not to tell the Swiss what they should do. That would
                    be a “no-no”. But I would give speeches stating U.S. policy — what we do in this
                    country. I did give a speech reflecting the United States' position opposing the
                    legalization of drugs. I think it was an effective speech reciting the many
                    reasons why we oppose legalization. This was the position of the administration
                    and one I personally subscribe to. I was careful not to tell the Swiss what they
                    should do, but I thought it very relevant to tell them what we in the U.S. are
                    doing.</p>

                        spotty record. I would think there would be pressure on you as the

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>GILDENHORN: There are twenty-six cantons in Switzerland, which would be
                    comparable to our states. In fact, their Constitution is identical in wording in
                    many respects to ours. The canton of Appenzell finally gave women the right to
                    vote about two years ago. Actually, they were required to do so as a result of a
                    lawsuit filed by a women's group. I think Appenzell enjoyed the publicity and
                    held out until the last moment. What is interesting is that just three months
                    ago, the Swiss elected a woman as one of their Ministers, in what turned out to
                    be a very controversial election. Seven Ministers run the country with all parts
                    of the country being represented. They call this the 'magic formula'. You need
                    one Minister from the German part, one from the French part, and one from the
                    Italian section. You need a Protestant and a Catholic, and all four political
                    parties have to be represented. As you can see, everybody in the country has to
                    be represented on this Ministerial Council. In the last election, it was
                    required that they have a woman Minister. It had to be a Socialist from Geneva
                    to comply with the 'magic formula' doctrine. And it turned out that there was
                    only one woman in all of Geneva who had those particular qualifications.
                    Unfortunately the woman was criticized about her life style and she eventually
                    did not receive support in Parliament. Finally, they found another woman
                    candidate who was born in Geneva but spent most of her time in Zurich. She was
                    recently elected and has become the Minister of the Interior. Her name is Mrs.
                    Dreyfus, and I understand she is doing an excellent job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find — were you able to stay out of this one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: You observe but stay out of any controversial matters. Womens' rights
                    groups are becoming much more vocal about their rights. They're very sexist in
                    Switzerland. A woman is paid less than a man for a comparable job. That's part
                    of their culture but it is changing quite fast. But as an American Ambassador, I
                    would not get involved in that issue — that's too controversial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find your staff at the Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: I thought all of my staff were outstanding, excluding maybe one or
                    two. All of the members of the staff, American and Swiss, were highly educated,
                    dedicated, and displayed a lot of enthusiasm — really good people. My former DCM
                    served with me for almost three years. He was excellent — his name is John Hall.
                    He will be coming back here this summer to Washington to be head of Recruitment
                    for the State Department in the Director General's office. He is a superb
                    professional, a really a nice guy, and knows how to handle people. He has a
                    great deal of experience and I was really very fortunate to be associated with
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you any caveats among the non-career people when you
                        went out — You'd better watch it, these Foreign Service people are going to
                        get you, or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>GILDENHORN: You realize that there is a built-in conflict between career officers
                    and political appointees. I found that I could utilize the management skills
                    that I employed in the private sector to my duties in Switzerland. I felt that
                    it was important to include the staff in all activities of the Embassy. This was
                    easy in Switzerland because you had only 120 people on staff. You don't have a
                    thousand such as you have in England or Italy. The first day that I was there, I
                    had a reception at my house and invited all of my staff including all of the
                    FSNs. I always tried to have staff at my residence for events. I also got along
                    very well with members of staff who were Swiss. Many of these people had been
                    working for the Embassy for 25-30 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. It's the real strength of the Foreign Service,
                        what we call our Foreign Service Nationals.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: Absolutely. It was sort of interesting that three FSNs had been with
                    the Embassy for 25 years and would have earned a higher salary than me based on
                    comparable Swiss wage scales. However because of the law, they were restricted
                    to making $100 less than the Ambassador. Somewhere along the line, I got a
                    raise, and they cheered that raise — because they got an increase in their pay.
                    I got along with everyone and really tried to include the staff in all functions
                    and activities of the Embassy. We had many receptions at the residence and all
                    were included. On the Fourth of July, I always had a separate party for the
                    staff and their kids. I sincerely liked members of the staff, both Americans and
                    Swiss, so it was not a problem but a labor of love. I found to my surprise that
                    some of the FSNs had been there years and years and had never been to the
                    residence. I changed that situation immediately.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe I've got it wrong, but was it our former Ambassador
                        to Switzerland who got into a certain amount of trouble because of getting
                        extra funds...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: Yes, I believe that it was Faith Whittlesey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you under either personal or representational things
                        to watch your expenses?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: First of all, I contributed money to the State Department so I could
                    properly decorate the residence, which was really needed. With respect to
                    representational funds, I allocated it between myself, my DCM and Political
                    Officer, and so on. I was out-of-pocket very little. We entertained a great deal
                    but I was able to pay for the affairs with the funds the Department gave me.
                    Near the end of the fiscal year, we would ask for a supplement if needed and the
                    Department was very accommodating by allocating additional funds. If we were
                    short at the end of the year, I would pay it myself and not expect the staff to
                    contribute. I did feel that some of the officers should have entertained
                    more.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a new foreign Service — it's new Foreign Service for
                        me. Did you find that the fact — we really need both husband and wife to be
                        working — did you find this to be a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: I found that many of the wives of career Foreign Service would not
                    get involved and really made it a point that they had no obligation to be
                    involved. Sometimes we had jobs at post and some of the spouses would take
                    positions for pay. I know that my wife enjoyed running the residence and going
                    around the country making speeches. She was a good representative of the U.S.
                    She is a Trustee of the Kennedy Center and she gave speeches about the Kennedy
                    Center. She worked hard and enjoyed being a part of the scene. She certainly
                    made a good impression among the Swiss. But among the career officers, I found
                    in many cases that the wives were reluctant to participate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's sad — It's a generational thing — I came in in
                        1955.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: They made a point of it, overtly indicating that they had no
                    obligation or duty to participate in the Embassy's programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know. There's a militancy. I was principal officer in
                        Naples and had some of the same problems.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: I do not understand or agree, because part of the joy of being
                    overseas is to be able to participate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So often they're missing something...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: I think so, yes. My wife and I became friendly with wives of our
                    officers. But as far as really doing things, and especially entertaining, they
                    really have a problem with that and virtually did very little.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here you've been an advisor to the Vice President, now the
                        President, so unlike many Ambassadors, career or non-career, you did have an
                        In with the President. Did you ever call on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>GILDENHORN: Not really. I never had any unusual problems which required that type
                    of influence. There was one matter when I felt compelled to call Larry
                    Eagleburger directly — the problem involved the plans to close the Geneva
                    Consulate. It caused great controversy in the Geneva community, with so many
                    local Americans living there and with Geneva being the headquarters of American
                    Citizens Abroad — a very vocal group which represents Americans living in
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a political group — they have votes at the
                        Convention.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: Andrew Sundberg, the President of ACA, and ran for President of the
                    U.S. I warned the Department about the strong feelings on closing the consulate.
                    They accused me in the newspapers as the one trying to close the consulate,
                    indicating that it was in violation of the law. I told the Department that since
                    you are the ones who want to close Geneva, and not me, then they should come out
                    with a statement explaining the action. Eventually I called Larry Eagleburger,
                    and he worked it out by issuing a statement. I called occasionally to officials
                    in the Department to assist some of my employees who were trying to remain in
                    the foreign service. I never called the President directly. I met the President
                    in Geneva one time and I met Secretary Baker a couple of times. I also met with
                    Secretary Christopher who came to Geneva and I spent half an hour with him. I
                    never had an important enough issue which required me to call the President
                    directly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever find yourself having problems with the Swiss
                        over our issue during the Reagan- Bush Administrations, over abortion,
                        opposition to drugs, this type of thing? Did the Swiss ever get into
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILDENHORN: The Swiss never commented on our sensitive issues. I will say that
                    the Swiss followed our election campaign quite thoroughly. To this day, they
                    still do not understand why we didn't re-elect President Bush. They really felt
                    that he had the qualifications, and had done so well in foreign affairs, with
                    special reference to Desert Shield and Desert Storm. They were quite surprised
                    when President Bush lost.</p>
